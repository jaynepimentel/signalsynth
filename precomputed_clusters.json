I bought a item on eBay and after its being sent around multiple mail offices it was marked on Royal Mail as returning to sender I contacted the seller and they had suggested once it was returned to them they would post it back out. A week went by and it hadn t updated, I asked the seller for any updates on his side and I got no response. So I opened up a claim on eBay and after 2 days they refunded me and I still hadn t heard anything for the seller. Another few days went by and I got a notification on the Royal Mail app saying the item was out for delivery again, strange as it was supposed to be returning to sender but again nothing came through the post. After another few days I went into the delivery office and they went to check if they could find it and nothing again. Later that day I got a notification that it was ready to be collected, so I went back the next day and they realised the address was wrong so that s why they couldn t deliver it to me, so I managed to collect the item and it was marked on the Royal Mail app as collected and on eBay that I had collected it. My question is really what do I do now? Is the seller out of pocket? Why haven t they reached out to me. It s so strange, it s obviously handy getting something for free but I feel guilty if the seller is out of pocket. Just so weird that they haven t reached out and asked if I collected it?",

This will eliminate confusion and build trust by making fees fully transparent and easy to understand.",
          "2. **Fee Estimator Tool Before Listing:** Implement an interactive fee estimator that sellers can use before listing an item, where they input item price, shipping method, and other variables to see all expected fees and net payout upfront. This helps sellers set accurate expectations and reduces surprises at payout time.",
          "3. **Dedicated Fee FAQ and Support Chatbot:** Create a centralized, easy-to-navigate FAQ section focused solely on fees and payouts, combined with an AI-powered chatbot that can answer personalized fee questions based on the seller’s transaction history. This empowers sellers to quickly resolve fee-related doubts without frustration or delays."

The listing said UPS Standard, and it is returned to the seller after a week, and the seller changed shipping to FedEx without my approval. First, the UPS shipment was returned. Then FedEx tried again, but customs stopped it. FedEx asked me to pay $1,535 in duties and brokerage fees and even provide my SSN to set up a brokerage account today. Now FedEx tracking shows Delivered, but the delivery address is the seller s location in Canada , not mine. It looks like the package was returned. I opened INR case, and ebay told me to wait for 10 days. eBay support told me the shipping method doesn t matter as long as it s delivered, but I never received the item. It's been a month since I paid. What should I do next? Since it looks like it's returned to the seller again, I don't have to pay customs right? Has anyone dealt with something like this before? What happens if I don't pay customs? Thanks in advance. Update: eBay already confirmed that I ll get a refund because Ebay didn t receive valid proof of delivery from the seller , so luckily I can get a full refund in 2-3 days.",

I messaged the buyer and told him the same, and as you can expect, the buyer is only willing to pay me the value of what the raw card is worth. This means in the range of $200-$300.... What a surprise! This is off by miles, but what can I expect? Someone to be decent these days and compensate me half of what the card is worth?!? Not a chance! Moral of the story: Don't be like me.

I messaged the buyer and told him the same, and as you can expect, the buyer is only willing to pay me the value of what the raw card is worth. This means in the range of $200-$300.... What a surprise! This is off by miles, but what can I expect? Someone to be decent these days and compensate me half of what the card is worth?!? Not a chance! Moral of the story: Don't be like me. Don't be stupid and double check before you list an item on the eBay vault. Take your time, review the listing multiple times if you have to, and then list the item. If you don't YOU WILL GET SHAFTED AND YOU WILL LOSE MONEY!",

Make these reports accessible to both buyers and sellers before purchase to build confidence.",
          "2. **Pre-Vault Inspection Option:** Allow sellers to send items to eBay Vault for a comprehensive authenticity and condition inspection before listing, with results shared publicly on the listing. This ensures buyers know exactly what they’re purchasing even if they never see the physical card beforehand.",
          "3. **Live Verification Updates:** Implement a system where sellers and buyers can track the item’s status through the Vault process in real-time, including timestamps and verification milestones (e.g., receipt, scanning, authenticity check). This transparency reduces uncertainty and increases trust in the transaction."

The low market value showing on the PSA website for the card is $350 less than what I paid for it.  Would I really just have to eat losing that money for a card I didn't even get to get my hands on?  I don't see how it would be the seller's fault since he didn't handle that part of the shipping but it seems like a pretty unfair situation as the buyer. Any advice would be appreciated.",

This reduces fake signatures and provides buyers with concrete proof of delivery, increasing trust and enabling faster dispute resolution.",
          "2. **Introduce a Buyer Protection Escrow for Third-Party Services:** When transactions involve third-party services (like grading by PSA), hold the payment in escrow until the buyer confirms receipt of the final item. This protects buyers from losing money if the final shipment is lost or mishandled, improving buyer confidence in complex transactions.",
          "3. **Create a Transparent Multi-Party Shipping Chain Tracker:** Develop a feature that tracks and displays each handoff in the shipping chain (seller → grading service → final shipment) with timestamps and responsible party info. This transparency helps clarify liability in case of issues and reassures buyers about the process, boosting conversion on items requiring additional services."

This builds trust by keeping users informed and managing expectations during incidents.",

Include an optional tooltip or FAQ link to educate buyers on the purpose and fairness of reserves, reducing confusion and negative feedback.",
          "2. **Enable Seller-Buyer Reserve Price Communication Tools:** Implement a feature allowing sellers to optionally share a confidential reserve price range or minimum acceptable price with interested bidders via a secure messaging system. This can help buyers understand the seller’s expectations without publicly disclosing the reserve, fostering trust and reducing “fairness” complaints.",
          "3. **Offer Dynamic Reserve Price Suggestions Based on Market Data:** Provide sellers with AI-driven reserve price recommendations that factor in rarity, past sales, and demand signals. This helps sellers set more competitive reserves that balance protecting value and encouraging bidding, potentially reducing polar bidding outcomes and improving conversion rates."

          "1. **Implement a \"Contract Lock\" on Winning Bids:** Once a buyer wins an auction and pays, lock the item from being relisted or sold to others until the transaction is either completed or formally cancelled by eBay. This prevents sellers from relisting or selling the same item to another buyer, reducing contract breaches and increasing buyer trust.",
          "2. **Enhanced Seller Accountability Dashboard:** Create a dashboard that flags sellers with patterns of cancellations, refunds, or suspicious relisting behavior. Automatically restrict or review sellers who repeatedly cancel fulfilled transactions or relist sold items, and prominently display warnings to buyers before purchase.",
          "3. **Buyer Protection Escalation Workflow:** Develop a streamlined, transparent escalation process for buyers to report contract breaches like this, including automatic temporary holds on disputed items, faster investigation timelines, and clear communication on rights and next steps. Integrate legal recourse information and Trading Standards reporting options within the platform."

I had a listing for each coin and the buyer bought them a few hours apart and so I had two shipping labels. Well like a dumb ass I put both coins and shipping labels on the same box. So, I shipped out just one box. The buyer got their coins and left me a good review however, USPS only scanned one of the labels, so only one of the coins shows as delivered. What can I do so I get paid out for both coins?",

I sent a mortified message to the buyer, taking responsibility, even if I wasn't all that sure I was responsible. I didn't specifically offer to refund in that message as I was 1. shell shocked and 2. I assumed he would reject the card and the authenticator would send it back to me. BUt, the buyer accepted it. I thought maybe he jsut wanted to see for himself....I know I wanted to see it. But, it's been radio silence. There's no reason for a buyer to want a non-vintage card in poor condition. Why is he not returrrrrnnnnninng it!!! I\"m holding onto the money ($550) just in case, of course, but it's so weird. I had Pirate ship insurance on a package that stopped scanning for two months. They paid me for it, $1000. THey were nice, didn't ask alot of questions, great experience. Except a week after getting the check, the package started scanning again and was successfully delivered. I contcted them about returning the money. No response.....like....ok, now i have to hold onto that money until they pop up.

I'm not even here to argue if it is there or the authenticators did it themselves. We're not in a position to know for sure. I sent a mortified message to the buyer, taking responsibility, even if I wasn't all that sure I was responsible. I didn't specifically offer to refund in that message as I was 1. shell shocked and 2. I assumed he would reject the card and the authenticator would send it back to me. BUt, the buyer accepted it. I thought maybe he jsut wanted to see for himself....I know I wanted to see it. But, it's been radio silence. There's no reason for a buyer to want a non-vintage card in poor condition. Why is he not returrrrrnnnnninng it!!! I\"m holding onto the money ($550) just in case, of course, but it's so weird. I had Pirate ship insurance on a package that stopped scanning for two months. They paid me for it, $1000. THey were nice, didn't ask alot of questions, great experience. Except a week after getting the check, the package started scanning again and was successfully delivered. I contcted them about returning the money. No response.....like....ok, now i have to hold onto that money until they pop up. I feel like all these shoes are in the air and i\"m at the mercy of when they drop, lol.",

My buyers pay for shipping and I pay for and print out USPS prepaid shipping labels, attach the bubble mailers and drop them off in the dropbox in the post office Monday. I've been doing this for several months with no issues. The items always show as scanned by no later than Tuesday and the item makes it to the buyer. However, this week I have an issue. It is now Thursday and none of my 6 dropoffs from Monday show as scanned yet and I'm getting nervous; one buyer already messaged me about this.

I don't see any options to start any kind of case for me as a seller. I know that I can tell the buyer to open a missing package case but I was under the impression there was something I could do as the seller as well. Is this not the case? Most of the time I would have a missing package case it's because tracking updates have stopped; in this case the packages have never even been scanned. And I know that this is a USPS issue but can I get reimbursed if these end up lost and what process do I need to engage in order to do that? These items this week made me a decent amount of money and obviously I shouldn't lose out on hundreds of dollars for an egregious USPS mistake but from what I've seen it doesn't appear there are protections for sellers. Am I wrong? One thing I do notice is that even though none of the items show as scanned, I see that ebay lists the funds as available and the orders complete. This seems odd. Why would this be? How do I proceed with this if there are no changes today? Thanks very much.",

Back in May(yes 4 months ago) I sold a vintage Fendi bag on ebay at $3200. This qualified for ebay authentication which I'm very familiar with because my entire business is selling vintage archival designer bags. Within around 3 hours of the purchase the buyer had reached out to me asking to cancel the order because she found it on my direct website for cheaper which we all know is not allowed and I had already printed the shipping label and packed the item. So I let her know that and she said it was fine so I shipped the item out to the authentication hub. Authentication comes back authentic and item matches listing description and ebay ships it to the buyer. About 5 hours after delivery the buyer says ths bag has a huge gaping hole in it and sends me a photo. It was a huge hole and obviously I'm shocked because I sent the bag out in excellent condition. I also have a packing video, as I video tape every package I send out for this reason, and there is no hole. The buyer escalates it to ebay and sends it back to their authentication center. The authenticators review the item and deny it saying the hole wasnt there when they inspected it either, so they deny the return and ship the damaged bag back to her, where she then tries to refuse picking it up from the post office for days and then ebay finally closed the refund case and I thought it was all handled until today I receive a message from ebay saying that the buyer opened a dispute with her financial institution. The notice said I was protected under seller protection guidelines and that no further action is needed at this time, but if the buyer escalates the dispute they'll let me know if action is needed. Is there any chance I'll be on the hook for this buyer very clearly damaging an expensive bag hoping for a return?",

        "2. **Automated Shipping Method Change Alerts & Buyer Approval:** If a seller changes the shipping carrier or method after purchase, automatically notify the buyer and require explicit approval before proceeding. This prevents unauthorized changes that can cause delivery issues and increases buyer confidence."
