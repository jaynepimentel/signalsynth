I've had Chase UK as my payout bank on ebay for a few years with no issues and just a few days ago they said I needed to reverify, so I tried and it just wouldn't let me. Then I tried with my other bank account, First Direct, and it also wouldn't let me add that either! I asked customer services and they got back to me 2 days later to say I needed to use a different bank. So annoying that I need to open a new bank account just because ebay doesn't like these two banks. Has anyone else had this problem? And are there any other UK banks that ebay doesn't like? I don't want to open a new bank account just to find out that ebay doesn't like that bank either! Thanks!",

I don't know if I'm doing it all wrong, but anyway, once I have an order, I pack my article and go straight to FedEx, they make a proforma invoice that is sent with the parcel. I then add the tracking number, and wait for it to get delivered. During my last sale, the parcel was held by customs, requiring more documents, and so FedEx sent me a paper to fill, which should have been filled with shoe details (materials made with, construction type, lining, sole...)... I'm not doing the ebay method by buying a shipping label... if I add any other fee to my sale I'll be at a loss. cause it costs me \"product's value+ebay's fees+ high shipping cost\", so I'm left with a tiny margin, unless I sell a high value product, which is something I'm not ready for yet. do you think it's a good idea to print my own commercial invoice, that should include my personal information, receiver information, tax ID, product value... (I'm not a company)... or should I just keep doing it with the proforma invoice with FedEx? what do you think is the most professional way to do it? your help is greatly appreciated",

I have a couple of questions: 1) is it advisable? A part of me says no because if I'm the one paying and organizing for the insured shipment, in case of problems the buyer would open a case against me and me against the courier, but if the buyer is paying the courier, they could then open a case for missing receipt of the item as well a case against the courier 2) in case it is, how to deal with that on eBay? Proceed as usual but require a tracking code to put on the item selling before giving the package to the courier, so that the actual tracking is guaranteed? Thank you!",

The auctioneer claims everything sold is \"donated to them\". Won't say who the consignors are (which is odd and I think legally required in my state?) There's always a bunch of high end coins, tons of gold jewelry, sterling silver flatware sets, and just tons of expensive merchandise. The stuff sells obscenely high because I'm pretty sure coin and antique dealers are \"donating\" the stuff and running their own lots up. I've been to six auctions and seen stuff sell multiple times for 2-3 times where it would sell elsewhere. The auctioneer claims \"all the money brought in goes to the wildlife rescue\". Whole thing seems really weird. This isn't a typical charity auction by any means. People don't donate 2-5k worth of gold jewelry every single time (twice a month), or thousands of dollars of silver and sometimes gold coins.",

I dropped it off at my local Post office on Jan 2 and never got any tracking update. Checked at my post office a week after no update. The said there could be a delay so I said okay. It’s been over a month now and buyer just asked for a refund bc item never showed up. I can’t get in contact with anyone to help.

The item was then delivered to the buyer on Thursday, and a return request was started today with the reason being “ordered by mistake”, which was hard to believe as I discussed shipment details with the buyer prior to shipment. I declined the return request and then 10 minutes later I received a payment dispute with the reason being “The item doesn't match the description in your listing.”. I supplied additional photos of the item in the dispute, as well as the screenshot of the return request where the buyer stated basically that they wanted to return the device for buyers remorse.

I am getting a very high demand item directly from the manufacturer, but they are worried about what I show as my item’s location. They had issues last time I got something similar from them, because once people see anything like this listed on ebay, they flock to stores and destroy the state’s retail distribution where they see the items location as. They want me to set the item location on the other coast, so people think it is being distributed over there first as they will be able to keep up with retail demand better there. They are still trying to recover in my area from last time I got something similar from them. I want to do this too, so people don’t know where these are being distributed for retail to first and then becoming competitors. I picked these up from the manufacture already and I would be shipping from my place on one coast, but the listing would show being located on the other. I am going to add 3 extra days for handling time to make sure shipments are on time. It does not seem like there is a clear answer if eBay is going to be upset about this. It sounds like it is a policy violation, but any large retailer is going to have multiple shipping locations and the items’ location just won’t be accurate in those cases. My account is 15+ years old with $200k 90 day sales right now and I don’t want to kill my account over this. Has anyone done anything similar and how did eBay respond?",

Spent days on end tinkering, trying apps, setting up launchers, getting meta data, installing apps and pushing the thing as far as I can with HD packs and the like. The thing is, now I have pretty much everything up and running, I find myself not really using it. I think I enjoyed the tinkering and problem solving of getting things to run, such as gamehub/ gamenative games, project Zomdriod, the 3ds HD packs and Wii U controls for Mario Galaxy. Now most things either run well or I've hit a wall where they aren't likely to according to various community sources, I find myself going to play something much as Pokemon ZA on Eden or FF Crisis Core on Gamenative and end up just switching to my MSI Claw, Switch 2 or PS5/ PS Portal as generally the MSI handles emulation better or being Windows can just run the games without needing emulation and obviously the PS5 and Switch 2 play things without issue. I love the duel screens, but at nearly 44, outside of nds, wii U or 3ds, I don't really use both unless I'm reading a guide while trying to sort something out as I don't have the brain power to play a game and actually take in anything in a meaningful way other than what's on the top screen without pausing. So I'm wondering, now the tinkering is done, is it worth hanging onto for anything outside of 3DS emulation and smaller form factor than my Claw. The prices for them on Ebay here in the UK are going for around the price I paid for it or more and I'm just worried that now I don't seem to be using as much, it will decrease in value as the batches get shipped out and I'll lose money if I decide to part with it in the near future. Anyone have any hot takes to talk me into/ out of selling?",

          "text": "ebays random payment delay is a bad business practise executed in an unprofessional manner I have a fairly new account and ebay delays my funds from the start. for packages the tracking number needs to be marked as delivered, but for mail additionally the buyer needs to also give a positive feedback, but even than sometimes still funds are kept. otherwise they hang for weeks. ebay puts an additional 3 days on top, so even when everything is confirmed, received and customer happy, still 3 days before funds are getting paid. add to that there is no instant pay, but the usual bank transfer of a day or more. I have good service status with 100 % and it has been confirmed from a capable supporter a month ago that my status is not the issue. ebay does this randomly. when I call the hotline the person is so clueless they don't even know what ebay is doing and I have to repeatedly explain to them, who supposedly are experts, that my issue is general and not specific to a certain sale. the support quality is so low it is not funny. it is not that I do not get what ebay does here, but there is zero transparancy, the supporters aren't informed, there is no time line, no outlook. on top of course the system does not work, meaning usually at least one item hangs where supposedly everything went well, but ebay still recognizes it as not ready for payout. this post got removed without any reasoning from the main ebay sub.",

I messaged them on eBay hoping to rectify the situation and I am waiting for a response. But I guess I came here for advice from the community to see what you would do in this scenario.

          "text": "Very, Very, Very Big: The Case for Macy's, Children's Place, and the GameStop Roll-Up The eBay thesis keeps showing up and I need to explain why it falls apart and what actually makes sense when you follow the money and the pattern. **Why eBay Doesn't Work** eBay is a $42 billion company near all-time highs with 2.9% short interest. No distress. No squeeze potential. GameStop already partners with PSA for authentication and PSA owns the eBay vault, so that synergy exists without buying anything. You don't acquire something 4x your size with cash anyway. That's not how this works. **What Cohen Actually Said This Week** In interviews with CNBC and the Wall Street Journal, Cohen laid out exactly what he's hunting for. He's looking in the \"consumer or retail\" sector for something \"very, very, very big\" and \"transformational.\" A publicly traded company that's currently undervalued but is \"high quality, durable, scalable with growth prospects.\" He wants \"diamonds in the rough\" with a \"sleepy management team\" behind the wheel. He called this strategy \"way more compelling than bitcoin\" and compared it to Berkshire Hathaway, \"except what Berkshire did in decades, we're attempting to do in a much shorter time.\" The plan is to \"apply the Cxxxy and GameStop mindset of brutal efficiency and increase the profitability of the company very, very quickly.\" He also filed an SEC 13D stating he \"believes that any Chief Executive Officer who fails to buy stock in the open market with their own personal funds should be fired.\" eBay is a tech platform. That's neither transformational nor retail nor unprecedented. **The Targets That May Actually Fit** **Macy's:** - Market cap around $4.8-5.5 billion - Down 70%+ from highs - Short interest around 7% - Generates roughly $1 billion+ annual EBITDA - Owns an estimated $5-8 billion in real estate - Anchor tenant in hundreds of malls - 450 Macy's stores plus 268 Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury stores - 167 year history **Children's Place:** - Mark",

It's an amazing set from a hotel in La Grande, Oregon circa 1925. We're located here in the Pacific NW and the only local antique dealer interested in the set is asking us to name a price. I have no idea if I should be asking $200 or $2000 for it. They include 46 Meyer China pieces, 10 R Wallace silver soldered pieces, and 7 glassware pieces. All are in near-pristine condition. More information on the history of this china and the hotel can be found at [https://rwcn-idwiki-2.restaurantwarecollectors.com/content/la-grande-hotel/](https://rwcn-idwiki-2.restaurantwarecollectors.com/content/la-grande-hotel/) What's a reasonable price?

Now that's a pretty limited run these days. Well surfing the net and watching some YouTube vids has shown me that Backyard Breaks had 50 cases, or 10% of the entire print run. Filthbomb was given a similar allocation, so now we are at about 20% of the print run without factoring in a single other breaker that gets allocation from Fanatics. Single boxes are so limited on the secondary market that they are going for 5x. There are a grand total of 23 available to purchase on eBay at the time I'm writing this. Call me a doomer - I don't really give a shit - but this is why you couldn't get Black & White or Bob Ross. And when you cant get those, and you don't want to pay 5x guess where you're gonna go - to the breakers. EQL or not, this is why these products are sold out in less than 5 minutes. Get used to only buying low end products or be a part of the problem and feed the breakers. When I can't get my hands on a case of Platinum Chrome Anniversary Fanatics I will officially be 100% vintage. Good luck everybody.",

          "text": "Do I owe taxes on eBay sales if I never received the money? Hello, I'm in a difficult situation and need advice. A friend asked to use my eBay account in December 2025. They made $14,000 in sales (after eBay fees, before cost of goods). My bank account was linked but eBay never paid out. eBay suspended my account in January 2026 before any payout. **Current situation:** \\- $14,000 in sales (Dec 2025) \\- Account suspended (Jan 2026) \\- Funds still held by eBay \\- Never received a single penny in my bank account \\- Friend says he can't pay me and will only pay \"once eBay releases the funds\" \\- Research shows eBay can hold funds 180+ days on suspended accounts **Questions**: 1. Do I owe taxes on the $14,000 for 2025 even though I never received the money? 2. How do I handle this on my tax return when the funds are still held? 3. What if eBay never releases the funds? I don't have invoices for cost of goods (friend was supposed to provide them but hasn't). I'm in Canada if that matters. I'm really stressed about owing taxes on money I never got. I'd really appreciate any help and advice in this matter.",

          "text": "How Much Does an Amazon Agency Charge? A Complete Pricing Guide for 2026 Hiring an Amazon agency can be one of the most important investments you make in your ecommerce business. Whether you’re launching a new product or scaling an established brand, the right agency can accelerate growth, reduce costly mistakes, and take over the time-consuming day-to-day tasks of Amazon account management. But the first question every seller asks is simple: **How much does an Amazon agency charge?** The short answer: **Amazon agency pricing typically ranges from $500 to $10,000+ per month**, depending on: * size and maturity of your brand * number of SKUs * services included * ad spend management * marketplace expansion goals * revenue level and growth targets The long answer requires a breakdown of pricing models and what’s actually included — and that’s exactly what we’ll cover below. # Common Amazon agency pricing models Most Amazon agencies structure their fees using one or more of the following models: # 1. Flat monthly retainer This is the most common structure. You pay a fixed monthly fee for a defined scope of services. **Typical range:** ➡️ $500 – $6,000 per month Best for sellers who want predictable billing and ongoing account support such as: * listing optimization * SEO and keyword research * inventory planning * customer service support * reporting and analytics * account health management # 2. Percentage of revenue Some agencies charge a percentage of your **Amazon monthly sales**. **Typical range:** ➡️ 5% – 15% of revenue This pricing model aligns incentives — the agency grows when you grow — but can become expensive for high-revenue brands. # 3. Percentage of ad spend (for PPC management) If the agency manages Amazon advertising, they may charge based on your monthly ad budget. **Typical range:** ➡️ 8% – 20% of ad spend This often includes: * campaign creation and structure * bid optimization * keyword harvesting * A/B testing * DSP management (if applicable) # 4.",

We sell Japanese / anime collectables I made a post just like this a year ago, here's a link to that post if you want to see the differences between 2024 and 2025. Also has some more context on what we do and what we sell: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our\\_2024\\_sales\\_statistics\\_as\\_fulltime\\_ebay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our_2024_sales_statistics_as_fulltime_ebay/) The quick rundown though is we (me and my girlfriend) are full-time online sellers who predominately sell Japanese collectables, of which we import directly from Japan. Mostly obscure, vintage, and rare bits rather than modern stuff you can find anywhere. Most of the time we have over 8000 active individual listings on eBay. Notable statistics: Net Sales: $190,465.79 Profit: $99,167.20 Transactions: 5367 Average ROI: 427.51% All of these number are a touch worse than 2024, but not by much. 2023, 2024, and 2025 all had very similar yearly totals which heavily implies we've reached the limit of what we can make with our current system / setup. This year was interesting, particularly due to tons of changes due to our current... administration. Tariffs were a problem for us, because being Japanese collectable sellers 99% of our inventory comes imported straight from Japan. You'd think it's just a 15% increase in buy costs, because that's what the tariffs are, but it's worse than that. Tons of shipping methods skyrocketed in prices, and many international shipping providers pulled out of shipping to the US entirely. UPS and FedEx both hit you with tons of additional fees alongside the 15% tariffs, often times as \"brokerage fees\". I could go into it but the short of it is... screw UPS specifically. So many issues this year. As well, a lot of panic in the early months of year caused a notable dip in our sales. February was the lowest month we had in years, a s",

The listing explicitly included multiple (3) strap options and an OEM stainless bracelet, which was one of the main reasons I bought this specific watch at the price I paid. The watch just went through authenticity this morning. eBay confirmed that the watch itself is authentic, but flagged a “listing accuracy issue” and stated that the additional strap and bracelet couldn’t be verified and would not be included in the shipment. They gave me the option to accept it without the additional strap and bracelet, or receive a full refund. The problem is that if I want to accept it and just buy a replacement bracelet and strap, just based on a quick search, looks like it’ll be $600-700. So by accepting it, I’m basically overpaying for just the watch head and one strap. Has anyone else had eBay authentication remove things that were clearly shown and described in the listing? Did you accept the item, return it, or get a price adjustment? This is my first time buying from eBay so I’d appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance",

Their customer service is usually good about it but I'm not willign to pay premium prices for low quality products anymore. Where does everyone else get their boxes, bubble wrap, and tape by the pallet load? Edit adding the suggestions here to make them easier to find. Thanks for all the help: * Multiple people have highly recommended The Boxery * Multiple people have recommended Grainger * Global Industrial * Zoro Tools * Value Mailers * Supplyhut * Getting used boxes from businesses like the Dollar Stores. * Smurfit Westrock Many of these vendors sell on eBay for the same price as buying direct as well based on people comments.",

          "text": "Can I escalate to the Financial Ombudsman if eBay refund buyers using my pending funds without responding to my complaint? Hi, I’m from England and I’m seeking legal advice on this situation. I sold three orders totalling around £2,000 using eBay’s “Simple Delivery” service (which includes Royal Mail tracking and lost-parcel coverage). Two of the parcels haven’t moved since they were scanned into the Royal Mail system, so the buyers opened “item not received” cases. Shortly after, my account was suspended — I suspect because of those two lost parcels, though eBay haven’t confirmed. I was told my payments would be held for 190 days, which I was okay with. However, eBay refunded both buyers using my pending funds, leaving me around £1,500 out of pocket. On the case screen, it said I didn’t need to take any action, and since Simple Delivery is meant to include coverage for lost parcels, I assumed both sides would be protected. I’ve already sent a formal complaint to eBay’s complaints email (confirmed by a customer service agent), but I haven’t received a response yet. My legal question is: If eBay don’t respond to my complaint within 15 days, how do I get a final response letter so I can escalate the issue — and would that go to CEDR or the Financial Ombudsman Service, given that it involves withheld seller funds and refunds taken from my pending balance? Any legal guidance on how to proceed would be really appreciated.",

          "text": "Never sell luxury items on eBay I’ve been selling on eBay for years, and for the most part, my experience has been fine. I’ve sold tons of low-priced items with little to no issue. But recently, when trying to sell a few luxury pieces, I had this feeling eBay never protect their sellers. I sold a Louis Vuitton bucket hat ealier this year. Without any communication at all, the buyer directly filed a dispute through their bank, not even through eBay, not even talked to me. There was no message, no reason, no return, just a chargeback. eBay said they would “fight for my rights as a seller, and talked to the bank” but after 3 months of waiting, 3 MONTH! I lost both the money and the item. No explanation, no follow-up, nothing. There’s absolutely no real seller protection when the buyer goes through their bank instead of eBay. The second time, I sold a Balenciaga hat (with the original receipt from the store). The buyer insisted it was fake because it didn’t look identical to another Balenciaga product he owned, which is absurd, since even within the same brand, manufacturing differences are normal. I accepted the return request just to resolve it peacefully. But then the buyer left me a huge negative review, all caps shouting “FAKE” in his review, extremely rude and completely baseless. EBay refused to remove this feedback, even though I had proof of authenticity and accepted the return. And of course, sellers aren’t allowed to leave any kind of negative review for buyers, so we just have to take it. I’ve learned my lesson. EBay is not a safe place to sell luxury items. There’s zero protection for sellers dealing with high-value goods. Buyers can make false claims, file chargebacks, and eBay will just shrug and say “we tried.” If you ever plan to sell anything designer or pricey, don’t use eBay. It’s not worth the stress or the loss.",

          "text": "Buyer requested refund after 8 days, what to do? First-time poster here I’d really appreciate some advice on what to do in this situation. A bit of background: I sold a limited edition Funko Pop (9,500 pcs) on eBay. I uploaded detailed close-up photos showing the box was in perfect condition ,no creases or damage. It sold quickly since I listed it at a lower price than others. The buyer paid immediately, and I shipped the next day. I packed it extremely well: layers of bubble wrap, plenty of padding, and “fragile” tape all around. The Pop was also in a protective case. I even took photos of the packaging before sending it out. The parcel was delivered on October 3rd, but today the buyer requested a return and refund, claiming the box was damaged. I compared the photos, and it’s definitely not the same box I sent it looks like they swapped it. I also checked their profile and saw they resell similar figures for almost double the price. It’s been 8 days since delivery, and I already received my payout. What are my options here? How should I handle it through eBay if I’m confident they switched the item? Thanks in advance for any advice!",

I had some extra 925 nib chains, so I tossed one in as a free gift. Cause it's a pendant and a chain would be nice if they needed one, right? The item passed authentication but failed because it didn't match photos. Because of the free chain I added. This was verified by CS. The buyer didn't even have the choice to accept or reject, it was just automatically sent back. Maybe I'm just stupid or naive, idk. But now I've lost money and a sale in a very slow moving market.",

However, on checkout, eBay does not allow me to select large envelope as the shipping type on an order. When I search and find \"large envelope\", it is grayed out and it says that shipping type is not allowed for the class of item. The cheapest shipping allowed on the site is Ground Advantage, which usually costs twice as much. Is there a way to bypass this restriction? I have been marking as shipped and buying postage at USPS, but then it doesn't come with tracking which causes other problems. Thx",

I asked where the price point is coming from, as last solds on Ebay are between £110-£120 / $150-$160. He said he uses Collectr app for pricing. So i went on Collectr app, and its valuing the TAG10 on there at £90 / $120. So, i asked where the $200 counter offer price point is coming from. The above was their response. For reference, its valuing the PSA10 at $175. Am I missing something or is this insane?",

It wasn’t some blown-up, hopeless project, the motor already ran fine. The seller just couldn’t keep it mowing because it kept shredding belts (likely from improper routing). When I got it, the mower was dirty and unable to move under its own power. The motor itself ran strong, so I figured it was worth the gamble. I ended up replacing the drive belt and putting on a deck belt, swapped in a new ignition solenoid and 25A fuse (one-time issue I tracked down), added some fuel stabilizer/cleaner to flush out old gas gunk, and eventually had to put on new rear tires after puncturing one while mowing my own yard (previous where already tubed and dry rotted, but did hold air) Total labor was maybe 6 hours spread over a weekend. After cleaning it up and putting about 8 hours of mowing on it myself, I listed it and sold for $2,000 cash in just two weeks. The numbers worked out great: purchase price was $400, total parts and supplies were about $400, so I was all-in for $800. Sold for $2,000, which left me with a $1,200 profit. This was my fourth riding mower flip, and honestly the smoothest. And I’m nowhere near done so expect to see more from this page!",

I knew right then and there it was too good to be true. I contact eBay for a refund. They deny it. I appeal it, they deny it again saying seller provided proper documentation... Finally I call eBay and get a hold of an awesome lady who said she has seen this more and more and sellers price stuff under $750, because no signature or picture is required for drop off.

I have been selling some of my things on my Ebay account to assist me with my bills recently. However, this morning Ebay put my payouts on hold while my account has a 'periodic review'. I spoke with Ebay customer service today and they told me that this review started because I had a noticeable increase in the amount I have sold lately & that it was a standard review. Ebay customer service said it would take likely 5 business days at minimum to finish this review and have my account hold lifted so that I can receive my funds. Since I am in need of these funds now to pay my bills, I am hoping that someone would be willing to loan me the money needed for my bills, and then I could repay them after my account hold is lifted. I am requesting two weeks to pay back the funds as I need to wait at least 5 days for my funds to be released from my Ebay hold and then I will need to have the funds transferred from Ebay to my bank account, which can take another 3-5 days. (Two weeks allows me the time needed plus a few ",

Lately I’ve been noticing some random delays with my ebay payouts even though not super frequent but enough to be annoying. Sometimes it’s flagged for review sometimes it just takes longer than usual for no clear reason. I made a couple changes to try and smooth it out. One thing that seemed to help was switching to a US based account fron Adro banking that can receive ACH and wires directly. Since doing that I think things have felt a bit more stable and I think it’s made my seller profile look a bit more established to the platform. I also started reviewing my return policy and shipping settings to see if anything there might be triggering hold ups especially for new buyers. Cleaned up some of my product listings too just made them a bit more US market friendly with clearer shipping times and localized pricing. Still figuring it all out though. Curious if others have run into the same issues. Is this just part of the game, or are there things you’ve done to reduce the friction with payouts?",

FEES FEES their so goddamn annoying i cant stand it, but my question being is that in the picture 7.15 x 13.25% =0.95, why do they have to include shipping w the fees so that i pay more?? It should be 1.99 x 13.25% = 25 CENTS FOR THEM IF ANYTHING not the fucking shipping label AND the item itself combined to take A WHOLE DOLLAR WHILE I GET CENTS!!! 0.87$ is what i made when realistically it SHOULD HAVE BEEN 1.25 or A FUCKING DOLLAR AMOUNT!!😀😀😀 im about to switch over to actual comic book websites cause atleast (i think) their honest about the fees they’ll charge and take. Don’t give me the “ohhh its ebay thats just how they make their” THEY MAKE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO JUST TAKE THE DAMN QUARTER ANS GIVE THE SELLER THE DOLLAR THAT HE IS RIGHTFULLY OWED!!!!

          "text": "How I failed my first 3 months in eBay dropshipping (and then turned it around) When I started eBay dropshipping, I wasted a good 3 months doing it completely wrong. I was trying to find the perfect products, spending way too much time researching items, analyzing competition, trying to reverse engineer what other sellers were doing. I maybe had like 50 listings up and I was getting like 1 sale every 3 weeks. Looking back, I realize I was just overcomplicating everything. The turning point for me was when I stopped looking for “winning items” and just focused on volume. Instead of guessing what would sell, I started listing as many items as possible every single day. I use Amazon as my supplier and list the same products on eBay with about a 100 to 105 percent markup. Once I shifted into that mindset, things started to move fast. I went from barely any sales to getting multiple sales per day. And now I’ve got over 10,000 active listings and I’m consistently doing between $1,000 and $3,000 in profit each month. No ads, no complicated setup. Just raw volume. Most people underestimate how powerful that impulse buyer behavior is on eBay. People just scroll, see something they like, and buy it. They’re not checking if it’s cheaper on Amazon or thinking too hard. They just hit buy now. So if you have enough listings live, you’ll naturally catch those eyeballs. I usually list about 100 new items per day. It sounds like a lot but once you get into a rhythm it becomes second nature. I also optimize titles so the listings show up in search, but I keep it super simple. The main mistake I see people make is thinking you need to be clever or find secret products. You don’t. You just need to play the numbers game. That’s what finally worked for me.",

Hi everyone, I recently started an eBay dropshipping store and quickly realized how painful the reconciliation process is. eBay gives me payouts, and I need to match them with every single supplier transaction. But the supplier side often has delays or missing entries, and manual reconciliation is super time-consuming and error-prone. To save time, I built an automated system that parses and analyzes both sides and flags discrepancies or missing data. It’s made my life a lot easier. Here is the screenshot: [EBay payout screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/qtX4Q7D) I'm curious: * Are you facing the same problem? * Would you consider paying a monthly subscription for a tool that automates this process? * What features would be a must-have for you? Would really appreciate your input — trying to understand if this is a broader pain point in the dropshipping community.",

          "text": "Seller canceled & refunded my auction win, then immediately re-listed item. How does eBay handle stuff like this? I’m pretty new to eBay. My apologies if this situation is common for most of you. The seller in question is small. Only 15 items sold and 6 current listings. Among them are a few comics valued between $40-80 each. I won at auction the most valuable of these comics for under $30. Seller then cancelled and refunded payment due to “missing or damaged item.” They then preceded to re-list for auction that same comic, but this time with a starting price double what I just paid. They didn’t even wait a few days! They put the book I won back up for auction immediately after claiming they’d lost it and couldn’t honor my win. I’m so sick of stuff like this. I’d never think of treating my buyers like this. I’ve only been buying and selling for a few months now, and this is the third time something like this happened. I reported it this time cause it was so brazen and insulting. Does anyone know if eBay takes these complaints seriously? It’s upsetting that I can’t leave feedback on this exchange. Seller only has a 89% rating with only 15 sales though. So I’m not the first person they’ve screwed with. Sorry. Rant over. That item has been on my list for years now. I was excited. Now I’ve got emotional whiplash and I’m trying to avoid going to bed angry. Thank you to anyone who read this far. I hope you’re getting a better site experience than I have lately. EDIT: Whoa. This blew up a bit. So sorry I haven’t responded to you all. I’ve been on the road for work and didn’t think this would generate so much discussion. I’m grateful to everyone here, and I did manage to find a way to leave feedback eventually. Took me till 3am to figure out how, but I was motivated. And I’ll definitely be checking out seller reviews more thoroughly in the future. Thank you everyone.",

          "text": "Does eBay always hold funds? Does eBay always hold funds for sellers? I thought after 30 or 90 days they don’t hold the funds until 3 days after order delivery? Here was my response from eBay when asked about it. I have 100% seller feedback and 44 sales for a total of around $7,400 in around 100 days. Just making sure this is true and not a line of BS. From what I have read, holds are only supposed to happen for 30 days..sometimes longer..up to 90 days. That’s why I reached out to eBay. Below is the email response from eBay: Hello Christopher, Thank you for contacting eBay Customer Service regarding holds on funds. My name is Abhishek. I understand you wish to know the reason why it is still 3 days. I am more than happy to assist you. First of all, I am really happy to know that you have been doing really good in terms of your selling performance. I can see that you are becoming truly a great seller day by day. There are numerous reasons why funds may be held temporarily. We use holds to encourage best selling practices and to ensure both the buyer and the seller have a safe and smooth transaction. Funds are placed on hold to ensure transactions are completed successfully. In some situations, this means allowing extra time after the buyer has received the item – even if they have left feedback – to review their purchase. This also means funds are available to sellers if they need to accept a return or provide a refund to the buyer. eBay must adhere to certain legal and compliance obligations, outlined in our Payments Terms of Use, which require us to place funds on hold in certain circumstances. We must also ensure eBay remains a safe marketplace for both buyers and sellers. This means we may place a hold on funds for some transactions. These 3 days time is actually a normal time line for every sellers to get their funds, there are cases where funds can be hold for longer than that. But, you have been on eBay now for 100 days there are very less chances to getting l",

I've had problems with impulse buying before however it was always real life shopping in a mall or a store and was about much smaller amounts. I think it's important to mention that I suffer with bpd and currently I'm very lonely and looking for ways to escape the reality full with boredom and loneliness which I think was the main factor to this breakout. Even though I realized the amounts I'm spending and that I'm having a serious problem and I'm trying to control it, I'm still opening the app a few times a day and scrolling looking for anything good. Whenever I see anything I want it takes me less than a minute to go to checkout. What do I do? How do I stop this? I'm not in a dangerous financial situation but at this point I feel stupid and annoyed at myself for this. Is anyone else having the same problem? How do I distract myself?",

I wanted to list a working 16TB hard drive, eBay suggested BIN of $11. eeeehhhhh?????

I sell LEGO set that I pick up locally at clearance sale and had a couple of 76419 that I picked up for $80 new, they normally go for $170 retail price and a few on eBay for more than $100 used. What did eBay suggest for my 76419, new in box? $22 each!! I really wish I can turn off suggested price permanently because it's using unreliable AI that can't account for condition and/or completeness, and may have grabbed data off someone's replacement firmware chip for the hard drive or a gold colored minifig out of that LEGO set and assumed it represented the whole thing. PS multiple choice listing sucks too. $100 item with $0.99 microfiber cloth makes them show up first when sorted by cheapest. Also keep out of stock listing sucks, they show up weeks and even months as OOS to draw buyer who would think look at seller's other item and end up with a much more expensive item.",

          "text": "I bought a perfume from an Ebay seller. It's a counterfeit so I returned it. The seller has now taken $100 off my return because \"it's been used\" I bought a full-size bottle of perfume from an Ebay seller a few weeks ago. Looking back, this was a dumb decision. The seller had about 30,000 sales and a 5 star average review. Still, I should have looked into this more. This was my own dumb mistake that I won't be making again, however... As soon as I received the item I got a bad feeling it was a fake. There was a sticker on the plastic wrap of the box saying it was made in China. When I took off the wrapping, the box was a bit dented and scuffed. The inside of the box was discolored as well. The bottle of perfume was slightly scratched and the cap to the bottle was scuffed up. I gave the seller the benefit of the doubt, though. Maybe this bottle had fallen off some truck and still could be authentic. However, I have a sample of this perfume already and I sprayed this bottle all of 1 time and it smelled nothing like the sample I have. I know this is a fake. It was sold as a new, sealed box authentic item. I immediately requested a refund, which was immediately accepted. The next day I dropped the package off at the post office with all of the materials I received included in the package (plastic wrap, sticker, bubble wrap, etc.) I just received an email saying the seller is only giving me half of my refund ($90 out of a $180 purchase) because \"it wasn't returned in the original condition\" and \"the item was opened used by the buyer\". This seems a little harsh to me considering a) this is a counterfeit item that I could not have known was counterfeit until I opened the box and sprayed the perfume, and b) the only difference between the condition I received it in and the condition I sent it back in was some opened plastic wrap and 1 spray out of a 75mL bottle of fake perfume. I'm wondering if I have any recourse for this. I know I can \"ask Ebay to step in\" by basically su",

If you've been following either this sub or the / r / gold sub for longer than a minute then you've probably been able to see this debate in the comments section. I'm planning on an FAQ for this subreddit because this topic comes up so often. Sorry, this is a longish post. There's something that the / r / gold folks understand that is being missed or at least not fully acknowledged from the Goldback side of the community in these debates that may be worth acknowledging here: **Not all gold with premiums are good investments and they may cause a financial loss vs. other forms of gold that run closer to the melt value. In fact, as a general rule, the further away from spot you are, the higher the risk and volatility is.** There have been hundreds, if not thousands of different fractional gold products that have been sold for high premiums, only to be sold for melt or lower down the line. These include fractional bars, fractional coins, and even \"Aurum\" (The technology behind the Goldback). \"Aurum\" in particular has a mixed record. There have been hundreds of \"aurum\" products before the Goldback was invented that have been sold at a steep discount, and ultimately melted down. Most of these were novelties or collectibles with no real or established user bases. There is usually no or little liquidity in other aurum products outside the Goldback. We don't even generally allow other non-Goldback \"aurum\" products to be promoted here. Even 1/10th ounce gold coins minted by the U.S. government have volatile premiums ranging from 10% to 90%+ depending on demand. They are hardly a great deal historically at 90% compared to 10%. The people coming here and calling the Goldback a scam see a gold product with a 100% markup over spot and are concerned. Some of them are rude or here in bad faith but there are good, educated people that see the potential danger. There is a real risk of losing half of your value on the Goldback",

I was bidding on it and said that autopay was activated and ill be charged my default method after 1hr. So I win the auction, get instantly charged and its being shipped to me??? I messaged probstein, but has anyone dealt with this? Going to have to pay 400$ in tax. Edit: to all the weirdo downvoters probstein just confirmed that eBay has been applying autopay to more and more accounts in the US.",

Did anyone else have ebay slabs go missing that were authenticated by PSA that should have been sent to vault EXACTLY when things went crazy mid January? I've had 3 seperate ebay orders (other sellers, not purchased from PSA) that they successfully authenticated on January 11 and 13, completely MIA now. Not on the way to the vault, and PSA doesn't seem to be able to find them. Not being impatient, I know how wait times are, but I've had \\*eleven\\* other orders, purchased *after* that, and authenticated as late as Feb 2 at the same location, already vaulted. Was there actually some kind of physical loss at that facility around that date? (Flood etc?) One of them was bought significantly below market and if it's completely lost I would not be able to buy a similar one for the same price.",

They can ask for more money and cancel the sale if you don't pay it. It might not be allowed by policy technically but it's pretty common and not really an issue.
