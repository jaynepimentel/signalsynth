          "1. **Add a \"Smoke-Free / Pet-Free Home\" Seller Attribute:** Introduce a verified seller attribute or badge indicating whether items come from smoke-free and pet-free environments. Sellers can opt-in and certify this, increasing buyer trust and reducing surprises related to odors or contamination.",
          "2. **Enhanced Item Condition Disclosure & Filters:** Require or encourage sellers to explicitly disclose potential odor issues (e.g., tobacco, pets) in item descriptions with a standardized checkbox or dropdown during listing. Allow buyers to filter search results to exclude items with such disclosures, improving transparency and buyer confidence.",
          "3. **Streamlined Return Policy for Misrepresented Odors:** Implement a clear policy and easy return process for items where odor issues (like tobacco smell) are not disclosed but materially affect the product’s condition. Provide buyers with a dedicated claim flow to report these issues, ensuring fair resolution and boosting buyer trust."

This will eliminate confusion and build trust by making fees fully transparent and easy to understand.",

This helps sellers set accurate expectations and reduces surprises at payout time.",

This empowers sellers to quickly resolve fee-related doubts without frustration or delays."

Introduce a Conditional Money-Back Guarantee Badge: Clearly display a badge on listings that are covered by eBay’s money-back guarantee even if the seller does not accept returns, specifically for cases where the item condition is misrepresented (e.g., marked new but has scuffs). This reassures buyers that they can get refunds for authenticity or condition issues.",

This ensures both buyers and eBay support clearly see valid proof of shipment and delivery status beyond just “in transit” or “delivered,” reducing disputes based on ambiguous tracking.",
          "2. **Clear Shipping & Delivery Expectations in Listings:** Add a mandatory, standardized shipping options and delivery method selector for sellers listing items cross-border, with explicit buyer acknowledgment (e.g., “Delivery to parcel shop standard in destination country”). This transparency helps set correct buyer expectations upfront and can be referenced in case decisions, protecting sellers from disputes due to differing delivery norms.",
          "3. **Seller Protection Policy Update & Education:** Update seller protection policies to explicitly cover cases where valid tracking shows parcel is available for pickup but buyer refuses collection, clarifying seller responsibilities and buyer obligations. Complement this with in-app guidance and post-sale notifications to sellers about best practices for international shipping and dispute documentation, empowering sellers to better protect themselves."

It was shipped 8 days ago & it's been stuck on it's on its way, since last Tuesday. But they're close by I contacted the seller this morning to ask for an update but he says it's probably lost, not really his problem & to directly contact Ebay for a refund. Am I wrong in thinking that the delivery is the seller's responsibility? Is there any chance he didn't actually send the real item? Thanks.",

          "1. **Integrated PSA Grading Partnership & Dashboard:** Partner directly with PSA to offer an in-platform grading submission service where sellers can request grading, print prepaid shipping labels, and track grading status within eBay. This reduces friction and builds trust by providing transparency and security throughout the grading process.",
          "2. **Grading Cost & ROI Calculator:** Add a tool on listing pages for collectible cards that estimates grading fees based on card type and condition, alongside potential sale price uplift from grading. This helps sellers make informed decisions about whether grading is worth the upfront cost, improving conversion and seller confidence.",
          "3. **Verified Graded Card Badge & Buyer Protection:** Introduce a verified badge for cards graded by trusted third parties like PSA, with a guarantee or buyer protection policy if the card’s grade is disputed post-sale. This boosts buyer trust and encourages higher bids or purchases on graded collectibles."

This protects buyers from losing money if the final shipment is lost or mishandled, improving buyer confidence in complex transactions.",
