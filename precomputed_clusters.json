          "text": "I’m Done Selling Cards on eBay – Sellers Are Left Exposed I’ve officially stopped selling sports cards on eBay. I sell sports cards — from low-dollar cards to high-value collectibles. Everything properly sleeved, protected, shipped with tracking, and handled professionally. Yet I’ve had buyers send photos of “empty envelopes” and claim the card wasn’t inside — even when tracking shows Delivered. And despite doing everything correctly as a seller, you can still be forced to refund. That means: • The card is gone • The money is gone • Shipping cost is gone • Fees are gone • And your time is wasted There is effectively no real protection when a buyer claims the package was empty. A tracking number isn’t enough. Delivery confirmation isn’t enough. The seller carries all the risk.",

Selling trading cards Hello All, I collect sports cards and recently started selling on Ebay, just within Canada. I was told to add shipping to the US to get much more buyers. I set the shipping myself for all my listings, which is usually $2 basic and $15 for larger tracked orders. My question is how can I add shipping for the US. What is the process to add US shipping...How do I set up my listing for Canada + US? How do I know that I am charging enough, or does Ebay set this up? Any tips to make sure I am not going to lose my ass in shipping would be greatly appreciated. I sell most cards shipped in a bubble mailer with card shields taped to the top loader. Try not to ship in envelopes unless its cheap $1 cards.",

          "text": "(Ebay Germany) Failed delivery - which process should I follow for re-delivery Hi all, Im just looking for some clarification on the next and safest step I should take. I sold quite an expensive item through ebay, it was shipped to the buyer via DHL, with the address they provided. Unfortunately DHL said they could not deliver it stating the address could not be found (maybe the label provided by the DHL shop got damaged - I dont know) Edit: The package is on its way back to me with DHL and I am following the tracking. Sorry, I thought I had added this detail, but I must have forgotten. Naturally I will not be taking any action until the package has arrived back with me Because it is such an expensive item I am always very worried of being scammed, so whilst this is more than likely a genuine situation, I still get put into alert mode. The buyer has asked if I can send it to a packstation, as he still wants it, but wants to avoid any further delivery issues. As far as I can see that is not an option as I would lose ebay protection given the change of delivery address. So - I see two options and I am seeking advice on which would be the safest and most trouble free option. 1. I send the item back to the buyer, with the same address as given when paid, and then the buyer can use their DHL application to redirect the item to a packstation of their choice. 2. I ask the buyer to request a cancellation, minus the delivery fee, and then they repurchase the item with the packstation/new address they wish the item to be delivered to. If there are any other options, eg whether I am actually able to change the delivery address on the same order, if requested by the buyer and still be covered, then I would appreciate any advice. Thank you.",

          "text": "How precise is the 24/hr shipping window? (To maintain top-seller) Seller for many years here - definitely part-time. Over the years I've not really paid much attention to whether or not I was Above Average or Top Seller... I don't have a store, just selling less than the 250 free listings/month. But, I decided to scale up a bit late last year, and while I was Above Average until now, I got upgraded to Top Seller in January. The only reason I haven't been Top Seller before now is 'late' shipping - I don't have any allotted days in for shipping/handling - so from what I can \\*surmise\\* the 24-hour clock starts ticking the moment the sale is made. My method previously has been to print the label within that 24 hour shipping window, then pack and ship. The same day if possible, if not, then taken directly to the post office the next morning (before 12pm). Normally my post office is quite crowded and all my packages are small, so I'd just drop in the box, I didn't really care about scanning so, they would sometimes be scanned late. As far I was concerned it definitely was still 'on time', as long as I'd shipped the day after the shipping label was printed, even if it didn't get scanned. Now that I'm scaling up and I'm at Top Seller, I DO care more. I've been trying to figure out the timing for shipping - if I have 0 days for shipping/handling, how many hours do I have AFTER the label has printed for it to be scanned by a carrier? 48 hours? 24 hours?........2 hours?? And, Im in an area heavily hit by unusual snow and ice, does Ebay automatically build in any delays in scan time for extreme weather-hit areas? We haven't had this type of weather delay for USPS in my area in at least 10 years. TLDR: Sold an item on Saturday. Printed the Label yesterday(Sunday). Its -10 with windchill and heavy snow listed for today(Monday), but scheduled to be 40 degrees and sunshine on Tuesday. Can I wait till Tuesday to ship? or nah? (Yes I know 1 package wont get me downgraded but Im try",

I am getting a very high demand item directly from the manufacturer, but they are worried about what I show as my item’s location. They had issues last time I got something similar from them, because once people see anything like this listed on ebay, they flock to stores and destroy the state’s retail distribution where they see the items location as. They want me to set the item location on the other coast, so people think it is being distributed over there first as they will be able to keep up with retail demand better there. They are still trying to recover in my area from last time I got something similar from them. I want to do this too, so people don’t know where these are being distributed for retail to first and then becoming competitors. I picked these up from the manufacture already and I would be shipping from my place on one coast, but the listing would show being located on the other. I am going to add 3 extra days for handling time to make sure shipments are on time. It does not seem like there is a clear answer if eBay is going to be upset about this. It sounds like it is a policy violation, but any large retailer is going to have multiple shipping locations and the items’ location just won’t be accurate in those cases. My account is 15+ years old with $200k 90 day sales right now and I don’t want to kill my account over this. Has anyone done anything similar and how did eBay respond?",

As of this morning, I’ve sold $13,488 in the last 90 days. Of that total, a pretty large number of cards are $20 or less, and they ship with eBay standard envelope. I charge my buyers $1.89 to which I pay $1.32. The additional 57¢ covers my material and time. If you believe eBay, their standard envelope takes 3-5 business days to arrive. It also claims to have tracking so you can follow your order. So that’s what a lot of buyers expect. Now let’s talk about reality. On average, my ESE deliveries are talking about 10 days for most people. Some end up taking up to three weeks. Some don’t ever arrive. “Tracking” is a complete joke. It’s not scanned by USPS at any point. They work with some third party, and the only times they \\*might\\* get scanned are via a sorting machine at specific hubs. As well as being a pretty big seller, I’m also a buyer somewhat regularly. I just looked, and of the last 10 cards I bought with ESE, only four of them showed as delivered. The other six, per eBay’s “tracking” would be considered long lost at this point. If I was a miserable human, I could very easily claim they never arrived, and force the seller to refund me. Even though the card is 100% in my possession. Now let’s talk about the threat. I received this email from eBay this morning. (Sorry for having to copy/paste, I can’t add a screenshot) . . . . . . . . . “Dear Seller, We wanted to remind you that your seller performance has consistently fallen below our minimum standards in the United States.

I have tons of rookies and inserts I’d like to get rid of since I just have them sitting. It isn’t worth the time or effort to sell them on eBay after shipping and fees. I haven’t been able to get any traction with posts in FB groups which is time consuming having to coin cards for each post. I’m not a huge seller so I don’t have enough that would be worth setting up to sell at a show. Just wondering what anyone else might be doing with success in selling cheap cards?",

          "text": "Any tips for getting out of “3 days post delivery” payment jail. Hi all. I’ve been selling trading cards on eBay for 1.5 years. About a month in after “proving myself” I started getting paid within a day or two of the buyer’s purchase. I maintained top rated seller status until November when I had one transaction count as 7 different defects for and INR case. I battled with eBay to get those defects removed and did prevail, but in the meantime they forced me to wait until 3 days after delivery for payments. This is devastating to my business as someone who averages 1,000 transactions per month and relies on the cash flow. The majority of my sales are low value cards where I have no choice but to send via eBay standard envelope unless I want to lose money by paying for ground advantage. Many times those never actually get scanned as delivered so it becomes a 30 day wait for payment. I tried calling to get it fixed but the service reps were no help and kept stonewalling me. One of them even told me “we don’t just give immediate payouts to anyone. You have to prove you can ship on time.” My service metrics are all great: .11% defect rate, .3% late shipment rate, 100% tracking uploaded in time. Over 12k transactions in the last year. I do get INR cases filed pretty regularly but I always handle it without eBay getting involved at all (except for that one aforementioned sale). Do I stand a good chance at getting the payment status restored after the Jan 20th eval? Has anyone gone through this before and gotten out of it? Currently have nearly $20,000 being held hostage in my funds because of this draconian change.",

So Im not sure if I'm doing something wrong, if post office regulations changed, or some mix of both, but Ive started having a ton of issues from USPS sending my orders back and requiring more postage despite the fact Im using the prepaid ebay label. For context: I have been selling trading cards on ebay since 2016, and started using ebay's labels around 2019. Over the years, every now and then I would get an order sent back saying it required more postage, but since the overwhelming majority of orders shipped no problem I didnt think much of it, especially since my local post office clerks never indicated issues with my packaging. Well, I turned in almost 30 orders at my post office on Friday, and when I opened my mailbox this morning all of them had been shoved in a USPS bag and crammed into my mailbox with a note saying each one required an additional $0.49 to ship. It indicates they arent machinable but I dont understand why... they were packaged the same way I always package them and over 95% ship out no problem, not to mention I send cards through TCGplayer packaged almost same way but with a stamp and never have issues there either. The way I package them: Card goes into a toploader, toploader wrapped in a thin piece of newspaper essentially. Placed in a 7x4 envelope with the label fully taped to the envelope with packing tape. Usually weighs between .6 - .7 oz with a thickness of roughly 1/8\" Is there an issue with my process or were my orders just handled by a disgruntled employee? If there is an issue with my process, what is it and what do I need to do to fix it? Do I need a label maker? Cause I really dont want to have to buy a label maker. Thanks in advance!",

          "text": "Stolen: Pretty much lost all hope, but I'm having a really hard time letting go... Reddit is all I have left and I’m hoping that maybe, just maybe, some awesome ppl on here might be able to help. Several years ago, this exact PSA 9 Shining Charizard was stolen from me. I was diagnosed with a form of cancer called Glioblastoma, and before long I was drowning in medical debt. I NEVER imagined selling this card, but the financial stress finally broke me and I immediately regretted it. So what happened, and how is it stolen if I sold it? After the card sold on eBay, I dropped it off at my local Packing/Shipping store the very next morning, and it was picked up by FedEx that same day. I insured it, and shipped it express w/ tracking. Days after it was supposed to be delivered to the buyer, and when I noticed the parcel wasn’t moving, I reached out to my store who then looked into it and told me that FedEx couldn’t find it. Eventually, eBay refunded the buyer and my store opening the insurance claim. Then by “coincidence” FedEx magically finds the package, and says it’s being sent back to me. I was SO relieved because I should have never sold this card. My father passed away from Multiple Myeloma four days before I turned 11 years old, but he bought me several packs of Pokemon Cards for my birthday before hand, which my Mom then gave me to open. I pulled this 1st Edition Shining Charizard from one of those packs and kept it safe for 17 years until my diagnoses at 28. It was the first card I ever had graded, and it meant so much to me for very obvious reasons. But then.... all that relief and thankfulness about getting my card back, getting to “fix” my mistake in selling it... completely vanished. The package did not get sent back to me, it was sent to the original buyer who was already refunded. But what arrived to him was only the EMPTY bubble-lined envelope. Clearly visible that someone previously opened and removed the card. The buyer reached out and told me this, and ",

What I do (in simple terms) eBay dropshipping means: • You list products on eBay • You do not hold inventory • When a customer buys, you purchase the item from Amazon and ship it directly to the buyer No warehouse. No bulk stock. No upfront inventory sitting on shelves. ⸻ Why this works • eBay already has 135M+ buyers searching daily • You don’t need ads, a website, or marketing skills • You leverage existing traffic, not create demand • Entry cost is low compared to most businesses This is why it’s one of the easiest online models to enter if done properly. ⸻ My results (context matters) • I currently operate 15 profitable eBay stores • Each store generates $1,000–$3,000/month • This is consistent income, not one-off wins • I also run an agency helping others do the same I’ll attach screenshots for transparency. ⸻ The part most people screw up (and get banned) Account warm-up. This is where 90% of beginners fail. I use a 4-day warm-up process: • 3 days before opening the store • 1 day after the store goes live Skipping this is why people get limited or suspended and then say “eBay dropshipping doesn’t work.” It does work — just not if you rush it like an idiot. ⸻ Costs & setup (real numbers) • eBay Store subscription: \\~$25/month • Listing limits: up to 250,000 items/month (varies per account) • No inventory costs upfront • No ad spend Limits increase over time as the account is handled properly. ⸻ Automation & scaling I use AI + automation software for: • Product research • Listing creation • Price monitoring • Order fulfillment • Stock checks I also use virtual credit cards to keep payments stable and accounts clean.

Also has some more context on what we do and what we sell: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our\\_2024\\_sales\\_statistics\\_as\\_fulltime\\_ebay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our_2024_sales_statistics_as_fulltime_ebay/) The quick rundown though is we (me and my girlfriend) are full-time online sellers who predominately sell Japanese collectables, of which we import directly from Japan. Mostly obscure, vintage, and rare bits rather than modern stuff you can find anywhere. Most of the time we have over 8000 active individual listings on eBay. Notable statistics: Net Sales: $190,465.79 Profit: $99,167.20 Transactions: 5367 Average ROI: 427.51% All of these number are a touch worse than 2024, but not by much. 2023, 2024, and 2025 all had very similar yearly totals which heavily implies we've reached the limit of what we can make with our current system / setup. This year was interesting, particularly due to tons of changes due to our current... administration. Tariffs were a problem for us, because being Japanese collectable sellers 99% of our inventory comes imported straight from Japan. You'd think it's just a 15% increase in buy costs, because that's what the tariffs are, but it's worse than that. Tons of shipping methods skyrocketed in prices, and many international shipping providers pulled out of shipping to the US entirely. UPS and FedEx both hit you with tons of additional fees alongside the 15% tariffs, often times as \"brokerage fees\". I could go into it but the short of it is... screw UPS specifically. So many issues this year. As well, a lot of panic in the early months of year caused a notable dip in our sales. February was the lowest month we had in years, a s",

I just want to input my cards, and then see what they are going for on EBay minimally. Then, I want to be able to sort the entire collection by the Market Value. CollX & CardDealerPro don’t have this ability. You can see the “market value”, but the “sort by” function not being there is a total letdown. eBay collection comes the closest, but it does something called “Sort by Market Value” that doesn’t reflect their own “median” sell price, so I don’t even know what the hell that means when they aren’t in order via that number. Maybe this is fine? But I don’t understand what they are using to calculate this. I’m not even selling cards, I just want to see what ones are worth the most.

Now, i’m looking for an Ohtani Auto but they are all over $2500 and no one is willing to sell outside the US. I’ve messaged many sellers without success. I understand the potential problems for the sellers in this case. My preffered shipping method would be DHL insured for full value as i don’t want to skip customs in, i just want the card to arrive safely. :) Card shows are not an option as they are very scarce in the EU and sportscards for US sports are even harder to get (mostly Pokemon and other gaming cards). And other auction sites like Goldin or Heritage just don’t offer a variety of cards like eBay and tend to only offer even more expensive cards. Does anybody have suggestion how to work the problem or how to communicate with a seller to make an exception? I also would like to add that i still would like to use eBay just for safety reasons. Thanks!",

The buyer opened a return claiming it was “not as described” because it didn’t include cables... even though my listing clearly said “no cables included” with all the shipping info at the bottom, and the photos matched perfectly. He then closed his own return, admitted it wouldn’t let him reopen, and told me to “just do the return outside eBay.” I said I’d check with eBay first. I called eBay (multiple times). They said the case was closed, the item was as described, and I should not accept any return outside of eBay. So the buyer files a credit card chargeback. Annoying, and my first one. I filled it all out, same day (Oct 22). After filing he STILL messages me multiple times for a few days asking for my home address to mail the item back via UPS (it’s huge). I told him I would not give him my address because I cannot accept a return. He kept messaging me and saying he was going to send it to my PO Box if I didn’t respond. eBay told me to just stop responding. Yesterday, the item shows back up. He returned it to our PO BOX outside of eBay and after being told not to. Now there’s a giant $5K box sitting in my house — still sealed, zip-tied, unopened — and eBay says to keep it sealed while the bank decides. To make it worse, the buyer added a USPS tracking number to the dispute 11 days after filing it, so it looks like I “accepted” a return. That’s a huge policy violation (you can’t do both a return and a chargeback), but apparently eBay’s system let him sneak it in. I’ve got call notes, photos, screenshots, a call ID from Escalations leadership, and confirmation from multiple reps that I did everything right. Still, the funds are on hold and I’m stuck waiting to see if the bank sides with the buyer (which we all know they often do) — even though he went completely outside eBay policy, and I did NOTHING wrong.

I've been using bubble mailers in the rare instances when I've had cards of that value before, but it's typically been around $7-$8 dollars (I don't think it helps that I live in the Northwest and ship out East a lot), and I would really like to reduce that amount if I can.

The drama begins 4 months ago with this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheNanny/comments/1lpkjby/the_infamous_nanny_robe_aka_canyon_group_and/). In it OP recounts their unsatisfactory experience with a company known as The Canyon Group. The Canyon Group is a manufacturer of chenille bathrobes and state their bathrobes \"have garnered a global reputation for being the warmest and fluffiest, adored not only by fans but also by celebrities\" per their website. Canyon advertised a custom made\"hot hearts\" bathrobe that was purportedly the same design that Fran Drescher wore in an episode of The Nanny. OP placed an order for one of the custom made bathrobes and recounted how almost a year passed with no communication for Canyon and no bathrobe. Eventually they just bought a similar bathrobe from Ebay and did a chargeback on their credit card. An apparent representative from Canyon finds the post and ends up having slap fights with several of the members of [r/thenanny](https://www.reddit.com/r/thenanny/) that evidently also had similar experiences with their company. >[Same experience here. I ordered one in the beginning of January. Have been continually strung along with nonsense excuses and lies (currently in production, shipping in 2 weeks, going out in next batch, etc.) for months. I feel extra dumb for spending the money on the “rush my order” option to allegedly have my robe shipped in 2 weeks. Well it’s been 26 weeks and nothing. It’s wild to see that they are still promoting their nonexistent products on Instagram, even had a 4th of July sale!

The eBay seller even made a shipping label (but I don't think he dropped it off at Post Office). Tonight, right after Yamamoto won game 7 of the World Series, he canceled and refunded my order. The reason listed as buyer requested cancellation. How can he claim that? I didn't cancel and he wouldn't have proof. Such suspicious timing too. What can I, as a buyer do, other than leave a negative rating for the seller? This is my worst eBay experience. Awful.",

I sold a graded card on Ebay. Went for an okay price. Delivered today, within 15 minutes of delivery a return request popped up. Buy stated damage and sent a photo. What they photo'd was a fairly common mark you get, when sealing the \"slab\" encapuslating the card. NOT damage. I was at work, so couldnt address the request immediately. I've gone to respond to the person, to be greeted by a message saying \"We took care of this return for you ,You don't need to refund the buyer, and you will not receive the item back. Thanks for trusting Simple Delivery\". So a few questions... Is that it? Buyer gets a free £400 pokemon card for nothing and i dont have to do anything? Whilst i'm not out of pocket, this feels wrong and has really rubbed me up the wrong way. I have 100% feedback on ebay, over 12 years, so I'm not sure i want to push this. But it just feels scummy.",

After years of collecting and trading at events across the US, we kept encountering the same problems every serious collector faces. Tracking our collection values was a mess of spreadsheets. Organizing potential trades meant juggling eBay sold listings, price guides, and scattered notes. And we never really knew our portfolio's true performance over time. **Sound familiar?** So we built CardNexus - a modern portfolio tracker designed specifically for collectors who actually care about the value and organization of their collections. **What we've built so far:** * 🆓 A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch) * 💸 Real-time price syncing across multiple marketplaces * 📊 Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early * 🗂️ Custom lists for trading, selling, or just organizing your collection * 🌍 Multi-category support: TCGs (Magic, Pokémon, Lorcana) and soon sports cards **This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on collector feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 8 weeks ago with the TCG community, but we're expanding to serve the broader collecting world. Today, we're opening 200 beta spots for r/collectors ! We're offering a **$200 collectibles credit** (your choice - TCGPlayer, eBay, or whatever marketplace you prefer) to one lucky member who joins via our link, uploads their collection, and creates a trade/sell list! **Get your invite here** —> [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=collectors](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=collectors) Our marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker w",

I do weekly payouts and they’re usually $1300-$2500 per week. My last payout was $800. It’s Sunday today and as of now this week’s payout will be maybe $400. I’m still listing new items, about 5 per day. My inventory has not changed very much and the things I normally sell multiple of per week (a lot of my inventory is multiple quantity, ie 1 listing with 200 available) aren’t selling at all. The only thing that has changed (my metrics are still outstanding) is I have an open eBay international return that’s about $300. The item was fully operational, sold through the international program. After shipping I get an item not received 2 weeks later. eBay received it and shipped to customer but it was still en route. 2 days later customer opens a return. I don’t know the reason for the return since eBay is handling it. When I click on details it only says eBay is handling it. Part of me thinks the customer opened the return before receiving since there were shipping delays. eBay will end up paying the customer back the $300, not me. Is it possible this return has throttled my sells or is it just a coincidence. It’s strange they coincided with one another and I just can’t see any other reason. Anyone experience something similar. Lastly, the sells I am getting are all really low value. $10-$20. I usually get a few big ticket items ($150+) per week. That hasn’t happened for weeks now.",

          "text": "I tracked every penny on 50 card sales. eBay's \"13.25%\" fee is a lie, and it's costing you thousands. Hey everyone, Like many of you, I run a side-hustle flipping sports cards. For months, I've had this nagging feeling that I was working my tail off for profits that just didn't seem to add up. I got fed up with the guesswork, so I ran an experiment. I took a batch of 50 mid-value hockey cards and decided to track *everything*. What I found was grim, but it provides some clarity on why so many of us feel like we're on a hamster wheel. **Part 1: The Time Sink is Real.** Just tracking the raw time to get 50 cards from a sorted box to \"sold and shipped\": * Photography: 2.1 hours * Research & Pricing: 2.5 hours * Listing Creation: 3.3 hours * Packaging & Shipping: 2.9 hours * **Total: Nearly 11 hours of actual work.** That's over 13 minutes of pure labor per card. By day three, I was so burned out on the operational grind I couldn't even look at another card. **Part 2: What I actually paid in fees was 17.6%** This is the part that should make you angry. I took one of my better sales—a **$35 card** where the buyer paid **$5 shipping**—and broke down every single cost: * Started with **$40 gross revenue**. * eBay's Final Value Fee: **-$5.67** (They charge 13.25% on the TOTAL including shipping and tax, which is how the number gets so inflated). * Per-Order Fixed Fee: -$0.30 * Promoted Listing Fee: -$1.07 (Basically mandatory to get seen). * Actual Shipping Cost: -$5.00 * Packaging Materials: -$0.75 After all that, I had **$27.21 left from my \"$35 sale.\"** The advertised 13.25% fee is total BS. My **True Effective Fee Rate** on the revenue I received was **17.6%**. Nearly one in five dollars vanished into a black box of fees. I'm laying this all out because I'm tired of guessing. I'm working on a better way to handle all this, but I wanted to share the raw numbers first. I'm curious if this matches what other high-volume sellers are seeing. How are you guys tracking this st",

Here are some facts: - plates sold @ $12,700 - buyer doesn't have any feedback - the name on the account that bought the plates is an actually reputable person in the city they are being shipping to - the address they are being shipped to shows up on Zillow as a house worth oflber $2 million - buyer left a note asking if I could ship FedEx What could I be missing?

Figured I either get a good deal, or worst case get my money back. I buy the item. Tracking provided. All good. Except for tracking it said 2 items were in transit. That raised an alarm as only one item was bought. Anyways item finally “arrives, except it didn’t. I live in a house, and tracking says delivered at front desk. I knew right then and there it was too good to be true. I contact eBay for a refund. They deny it. I appeal it, they deny it again saying seller provided proper documentation... Finally I call eBay and get a hold of an awesome lady who said she has seen this more and more and sellers price stuff under $750, because no signature or picture is required for drop off. I then had to sign a declaration stating I never got this and lying could result in perjury charges... but I finally got my money back. What a nightmare though.",

But if I list a card for $0.99 + $0.74 shipping and it gets lost? I only get $0.99 back. I eat the rest. So yeah, I’d rather build the $1.74 into the card price and protect myself than risk losses trying to undercut by a few cents. How do you handle low-end cards? Do you price low with cheap shipping? Bake it into the price like this? Or just skip the <$2 stuff entirely?",

          "text": "Shipped too fast via USPS Ground...buyer wants me to pay $27 Had an odd experience recently that serves as a good cautionary tale about using third-party international drop shippers. I sold a $9 card with free shipping to a buyer with a strange U.S. address in Florida. Later, I discovered the address belonged to CPS International Logistics, a courier company with a website not in English and a load of questionable reviews. I always ship cards, coins, and collectibles valued under $20 with eBay’s program for assured tracking and insurance through eBay/PiP. These are only designed to be shipped domestically. But this time, eBay wouldn’t allow me to ship to that address unless I used USPS Ground shipping with tracking. Despite trying all my usual workarounds, nothing fixed it. We are professional shippers, which is why people come back to us. So we decided to eat nearly $5 in shipping costs just to keep our promise of tracked and insured delivery, losing about half the item’s value in the process. The card arrived at the Florida address a day or so later, and we heard nothing from the buyer yet. About a week later, the buyer (not a native English speaker) contacted me, accusing me of violating eBay’s terms of service. Their complaint? I shipped the item *too fast*, used *too much packaging*, and didn’t use a *plain white envelope* as they apparently expected under “coins and collectibles” shipping guidelines. Now, according to them, they were being charged exorbitant shipping fees. Mind you, we use a small bubble shipping container that is about the same size and weight, not something you would ship a video game in (it's not a PWE, but it's not over 3 oz.). I reassured them the extra shipping cost came out of our own pocket, explained what happened on eBay, and reminded them we prioritize our customers' satisfaction, so this was just a nice thing we did for them so they could get the package fast rather than cancel their order. That’s when they told us they were using ",

I live in Azerbaijan, so I used this cargo forwarding service called **166cargo** to get a US shipping address because eBay doesn’t ship here directly. Then out of nowhere, my eBay account got permanently suspended. No real explanation, just some vague “security concerns.” Since then, I can’t contact the seller, open a dispute, or do anything about my missing package. I contacted USPS and filed a missing mail claim, but it expired with no luck. I’ve tried chatting with eBay support tons of times but all they tell me is “because your account is suspended, you’re not covered and we can’t help.” They said maybe after 190 days they’ll release any held funds, but I have no idea if that’s true or if I’ll ever see my money back. Honestly, I’m stuck. I paid $150 for something I never got, and now I’m locked out with zero support. Has anyone else been through this? What can I do? Is there any way to get a refund or even talk to someone who cares? I’m ready to escalate or try anything at this point.",

          "text": "How I failed my first 3 months in eBay dropshipping (and then turned it around) When I started eBay dropshipping, I wasted a good 3 months doing it completely wrong. I was trying to find the perfect products, spending way too much time researching items, analyzing competition, trying to reverse engineer what other sellers were doing. I maybe had like 50 listings up and I was getting like 1 sale every 3 weeks. Looking back, I realize I was just overcomplicating everything. The turning point for me was when I stopped looking for “winning items” and just focused on volume. Instead of guessing what would sell, I started listing as many items as possible every single day. I use Amazon as my supplier and list the same products on eBay with about a 100 to 105 percent markup. Once I shifted into that mindset, things started to move fast. I went from barely any sales to getting multiple sales per day. And now I’ve got over 10,000 active listings and I’m consistently doing between $1,000 and $3,000 in profit each month. No ads, no complicated setup. Just raw volume. Most people underestimate how powerful that impulse buyer behavior is on eBay. People just scroll, see something they like, and buy it. They’re not checking if it’s cheaper on Amazon or thinking too hard. They just hit buy now. So if you have enough listings live, you’ll naturally catch those eyeballs. I usually list about 100 new items per day. It sounds like a lot but once you get into a rhythm it becomes second nature. I also optimize titles so the listings show up in search, but I keep it super simple. The main mistake I see people make is thinking you need to be clever or find secret products. You don’t. You just need to play the numbers game. That’s what finally worked for me.",

          "text": "My Experience and Advice Starting Out on TCGPlayer (42 days in, 101 orders down) I have always been super into organizing and watching prices of Magic Bulk ever since I started playing as a kid in 2012ish. I finally decided to take the plunge a few months ago and bought a bunch of bulk cards to start a store on TCGPlayer. The main hurdle is really sourcing the cards and figuring out your storage and organization processes. I initially tried my hand/failed at finding hidden gem lots on EBay (the site changed a lot since I was kid haha). It feels like newer sellers don't have an advantage when selling/sourcing higher value cards as game stores can source them at way better margins. I was honestly about to quit before I stumbled on u/Damiencbw's posts on here about selling lower priced cards in bulk. I had picked up around 18k cards at admittedly a bad rate (3-4 cents a card) and sorted out all the cards above 10 cents. As a by day accountant who reconciles everything, I organized everything by set if sellable and any cards I wanted to hold in Manabox. I have so far listed 4,744 cards in my TCGPlayer inventory and around 4,300 in Manabox. I initially listed some of my own pricier collection at low prices to get the initial sales to move up the TCGPlayer levels. You really need to get to level 3 (11 completed sales) and then you can list to your heart's content (50k max listings). I learned a lot about the shipping and pricing strategy during this first month or two. I'll link the video I think I found on Reddit about the packing method I mostly follow. Getting in the rhythm of packing and listing is super important to build up stock and reputation. Since I am newer, I had set my shipping to around $1.36 to get higher volume (I plan to increase later). I cannot emphasize enough that having a higher shipping rate + minimum card price is crucial. You never want any potential orders to have zero or negative profit. An order packing guide I roughly follow - [https://www.you",

What were some bad choices/failures/scams that ultimately wasted your time or lost some money? I have my wrap up below as more of a newbie in the space, but I am super interested in hearing people's stories. Wins: I started in May of this year and have 25k cards listed in TCGPlayer. I bought 134k cards this year but have sorted all of them (still have 14k cards to list). I am now able to process cards quicker and have a wonderfully large garage shelf for storage. I bought a couple collections off of Facebook that really panned out. Some highlights include a $500 lot that turned into $5,000 and a $250 one that became $1,300. I picked up a bunch of Warhammer UB bulk for cheap which skyrocketed obviously. I hit 2,500 orders on TCGPlayer and 10.5k in sales this year. Hitting the max level and gold star seller really helped out on this front. I am around 12-15 orders a day now which is great for me (still small fry numbers). A chunk of these sales were not optimal though which is more so mentioned in the losses column. I got to meet a bunch of nice local MTG fans via deals and heard a lot about people's stories and strategies. It might not be the case for introverts but I love talking to customers or suppliers about anything cardboard. Losses: I was new to buying bulk and bought a bunch of crap off of eBay for little to no return. I bought cards at way above rate and had to work hard just to not lose money which wasted time. A lowlight included spending $150 on 5k cards which were obviously picked through. It taught me a lot about sourcing though and thankfully wasn't a big deal. Buying non windowed envelopes and spending hours handwriting addresses 500 times. Learned a lot about packing orders more efficiently from this haha. Some silly USPS issues that were partially my fault (losing around a 100-200 bucks). A highlight was getting a U",

This was posted months ago in a smaller Facebook group for TCGplayer sellers and I was pretty shocked when I saw it. I debated even bringing this over to here because it shows, truly, how much TCGplayer doesn't care, which only promotes bad behavior. I'm nearly positive this has been a known issue on TCGplayer for a long, long time anyway, but I've really had enough seeing fellow sellers and friends getting scammed by buyers with TCGplayer, literally, doing nothing about it. The TLDR of the screenshot is a scumbag buyer going to BBB (lol) because TCGplayer deactivated his account due to making 62 \"missing order\" claims in 4 months. That statement alone is ludicrous but let's dive a little deeper. Why did it take 62, sixty two (!!!) claims by the same buyer IN 4 MONTHS for TCGplayer to \"do something\" here? Is 61 the magic number where people can get away with it? Did TCGplayer go back to each seller this affected and reimburse? Highly doubtful. I thought they were vigilant with tracking this kind of behavior? On what planet is the resolution \"change your address and you're good\"?!? This should be a ban for that buyer or suspension at the very least! Is there anyone with some more influence out there that can promote this for awareness? Something's gotta give here. I have no idea why they can't implement tracked envelopes, which largely protects buyers and sellers. I get that it still won't eliminate this behavior but surely it would cut down on it? Their parent company, eBay uses it, what's the excuse? Mercari even has it and I've had ZERO issues using it there.",

          "text": "I have always been super into organizing and watching prices of Magic Bulk ever since I started playing as a kid in 2012ish. I finally decided to take the plunge a few months ago and bought a bunch of bulk cards to start a store on TCGPlayer. The main hurdle is really sourcing the cards and figuring out your storage and organization processes. I initially tried my hand/failed at finding hidden gem lots on EBay (the site changed a lot since I was kid haha). It feels like newer sellers don't have an advantage when selling/sourcing higher value cards as game stores can source them at way better margins. I was honestly about to quit before I stumbled on u/Damiencbw's posts on here about selling lower priced cards in bulk. I had picked up around 18k cards at admittedly a bad rate (3-4 cents a card) and sorted out all the cards above 10 cents. As a by day accountant who reconciles everything, I organized everything by set if sellable and any cards I wanted to hold in Manabox. I have so far listed 4,744 cards in my TCGPlayer inventory and around 4,300 in Manabox. I initially listed some of my own pricier collection at low prices to get the initial sales to move up the TCGPlayer levels. You really need to get to level 3 (11 completed sales) and then you can list to your heart's content (50k max listings). I learned a lot about the shipping and pricing strategy during this first month or two. I'll link the video I think I found on Reddit about the packing method I mostly follow. Getting in the rhythm of packing and listing is super important to build up stock and reputation. Since I am newer, I had set my shipping to around $1.36 to get higher volume (I plan to increase later). I cannot emphasize enough that having a higher shipping rate + minimum card price is crucial. You never want any potential orders to have zero or negative profit. An order packing guide I roughly follow - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2cybvXQ1Kw&t=287s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2cybvXQ1Kw&",

They can ask for more money and cancel the sale if you don't pay it. It might not be allowed by policy technically but it's pretty common and not really an issue. If you ask them to revise the listing to charge you the additonal, they could probably do that too.",

The auctioneer claims everything sold is \"donated to them\". Won't say who the consignors are (which is odd and I think legally required in my state?) There's always a bunch of high end coins, tons of gold jewelry, sterling silver flatware sets, and just tons of expensive merchandise. The stuff sells obscenely high because I'm pretty sure coin and antique dealers are \"donating\" the stuff and running their own lots up. I've been to six auctions and seen stuff sell multiple times for 2-3 times where it would sell elsewhere. The auctioneer claims \"all the money brought in goes to the wildlife rescue\". Whole thing seems really weird. This isn't a typical charity auction by any means. People don't donate 2-5k worth of gold jewelry every single time (twice a month), or thousands of dollars of silver and sometimes gold coins.",

I pointed out every detail that you can easily identify. They need to have a department that looks into claims better. I also see a ton of sellers selling fake silver and gold even us currency.

Where would be the best reliable place to bulk buy a bunch of cards that are common? I like the idea of making my own decks, and while I do plan on buying some precons, I would love the ability to just search through a collection and make something. I assume I could just go on maybe ebay or something for them (ngl I've never used ebay so I'm unsure if this is reliable). I do have some shops near me, but when I went they seem to just have binders which was nice for picking out a few cool cards. I just want a bunch of good common cards that should be in most decks! edit: sorry I think I used the wrong flair, I do not post often on reddit 😬",

I tried selling this card on multiple platforms like whatnot, ebay, fb marketplace but no one seems to want this and they prefer English cards. Its a bummer because I was planning to use any money I got to go towards buying another booster box and since its from the new OP-14 set i expected more people to want it.

The price on eBay for collection and drop off is the same price, £2.75. For months I've booking one collection, and handing over any extras to be scanned which were bought as drop off (again same price) so as not to have to have extra collections booked when they're already booked to collect. I also pack a lot of orders late at night, meaning that if I did book collections for the extra orders that come through late at night, they'd have to then be collected the day after the original collection day. I asked my usual postie if its okay to book one collection and hand over the extras to be scanned when he comes to collect in the morning, and he said it was fine. Done this for months. Today a different employee came to collect (they had manager written on their uniform), and stated that each collection costs 30p per parcel (which is the case if booked direct via RM), and they would \"let me off for today\". Am I in the wrong? For eBay this doesn't make any sense to me, being as the price of drop off and collection is the exact same. Happy to be corrected!",

To those who tried rage baiting or telling me it's a pointless post, might be pointless to you - but there's plenty of others who clearly wanted this to be said. Your rage bait attempts were also pathetic - gotta work a bit harder because unlike you rats, I have thick skin and can handle a bit of abuse without having a sook and reporting you to the admins. I've been speaking privately to Alex about this - and after our conversation, I can admit that my anger towards this group was misdirected towards him. The WTB post, now that I think about it clearly, had no reason to be in the original post - so I have now removed it. I guess I was just finding anything I could to put the admin team down, and I saw the listing (which was directly related to the origin of this post) and pulled the trigger. I won't speak to what he said to me - but I wanted to update you all on the fact that Alex has come to me and asked how he and the group can \\*help with this situation. There is a solution in the works - however reselling will never be banned. As much as I don't like the idea of them (scalpers) having a platform this big to sell on, I've done as much as I can and that's just the way it is. I want to thank Alex for fronting up to the comments below and my messages (I was fairly direct about his admin team's behaviour) as you copped the full front of everything instead of Rhys - the one who SHOULD be responding. \\*help - not completely resolve as the resolution we want is for reselling to be banned, and that's not going to happen. Rhys - after looking at all these comments and seeing all the people you've pissed off and how you've clearly chosen what people to defend in different situations, I think it's time for you to mak",

I must shout out raretendo6879 on YouTube for making the most thorough compilation of Alice in Wonderland lost media I’ve seen. Here’s the video in question: https://youtu.be/fhyepuS4hhA?si=U1NkR_6Q57jqIXan So for reference, I originally posted on a different subreddit; I was inquiring about an animation cel that caught my eye while browsing Ebay: https://ebay.us/m/aCi5Ru This thing looked so darn weird, I had to know more about it; I looooove Alice in Wonderland but I’ve never seen anything like this before. I looked at the listing, which stated: “This animation cell is from Disney's 1980 film : Alice in Wonderland \"For dinner or for dinner\" Furthermore, it elaborated on the Jabberwocky character seen with Alice in the cel: “The Jabberwock dragon was a villain character which was deleted from the original 1951 Disney film \"Alice in Wonderland\". Film producers decided in late production that the character Jabberwock was too scary for the films intended audience and the scene too violent. Only one original cel from that deleted 1951 scene has ever been brought to market, selling in 2012 for over $15k by Heritage auctions.” I was stoked because, quite frankly, as a fan of both the books and the movie, I always wanted to see a Disney Golden Age Era version of the dragon- I felt it was sorely missed in the movie; finding out that at the end, they actually DID end up doing something with him made me excited to see the fi",

Location: Texas Hey everyone, recently I was talking with a guy on instagram about trading some of my pokemon cards for some of his sealed pokemon product, we agreed on the trade and I asked him to open it and just ship me the packs inside. He agreed and said I had to ship all my cards to him first and once he verified that received the stuff I sent was correct he would ship out his end of the trade. I was fine with that so I agreed but later my parents found out about the trade and made be block him on all platforms as they believed that he was going to scam me as I have been scammed like this before and the trade value was above $2000. He then messages me on my ebay store threatening me to unblock him or else there will be consequences so I block him again as I do not want to deal with someone who has to resort to threats. He then makes a new ebay account and messaged me today with screenshots that he messaged one of my friends on instagram about me and with screenshots of my linkedin profile threatening to call my job and the local police if I don't compensate him for opening his pokemon box. I offered him to pay him the difference in price of the box sealed vs opened but he only wants the full amount for the boxes which is $800 even though the packs inside are still sealed. My reasoning was that he shouldn't have opened the box in the first place as he didn't even recieve the cards that I would have sent him yet. Shouldn't he have confirmed that I sent him the correct stuff in the trade before opening his product since I was supposed to ship to him first anyway? He says he will file a police report by the end of the week and I do not know what to do please help.",

I've done some google searching, looked at the tariff documents, and just have no idea how to accurately estimate what the tariff would be on a single card coming from the EU. One answer I found indicates that I would pay less if the seller marks that the card is of USA origin on the form, but I'm not sure if that's true or if I could trust the seller to do that. The card is a great deal and something I've been hunting for a while, so I'm ok paying some amount of tariff I just want to make sure it's not something nuts like 70% or something. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Anybody out there buy a single from the EU recently?",

          "text": "Is it worth adding an Amazon carousel to my Pokemon card eBay deal finder? Hi everyone, I've been running a site that finds deals on Pokemon cards on eBay by comparing the listing price to historic values. It's going really well, and I've started making a few hundred pounds a month from it at this point. My revenue for the last 5 months has been: £36 -> £73 -> £111 -> £163 -> £270 (by the 17th) So, I'm really happy with how it's been growing recently. The site shows a table of eBay listings with listing price (+ postage), historic value, price difference percent, and other info, and the listings are sorted by highest price difference percent so the best deals are at the top. Someone suggested I should add an Amazon carousel with products like card sleeves, toploaders, plushes, and other accessories with affiliate links. I really like this idea. I don't think it'll bother the users because it'll be at the bottom of the listings so it's not interfering with how the site normally works. Also, visitors are there with the intent to buy cards, so there's a good chance they'll be interested in accessories as well. My only concern is that I'll have to get approved for an affiliate account. I'm not sure how easy this is. What do you think? Would this be something worth adding?",

So I need help on how to price my collection, as in I use two different websites (Price charting & Collectr) but they show different prices and both estimate prices but can be a whole $4 difference or 0.50 cent, etc. on raw prices from recent or past eBay sales and other sites. So my question really is just what website should I trust more? Ex. My Unified Minds Collection - holo, reverse, normal, trainers, energies and duplicates, etc. all get added and than I lower the price due to me factoring in every cards condition whether they’re Mint, NM, Played, LP and so on at a reasonable price on the both ends Price Ex. Collectr - $115 or so Price charting $400-500 And like I said I factor in the card conditions, but the big differences make it hard to figure out the final set price I wanna sell each set for If anyone can point me in a more accurate direction or advice on what to trust more as I need the money from they cards and just wanna do it right and not hurt my pockets or anyone else’s",

          "text": "Determining Signature Card Values Obviously price is what the market dictates, but seeing how this question is asked a hundred times as the cards get opened, thought id share my thoughts and would like yours. As of right now Lee Sin signed is marked as sold on Tcg $1,200. Then ive seen ebay listings in fb group of Ahri $400ish and Voli $700ish My personal opinion is a good amount would be 2x value of what we see from Chinese market (closest counterpart). Im basing this off of Pokémons Japanese to English comparison. Japan being english pokemons closest counterpart. Also to get a signed card is around 30 boxes or 720 packs. When compared to something like Pokemon chase card the Unbreon Vmax which is about 1/2000 packs. I dont know the math on specific signatures, it might be higher. That card at that rarity sat at $600-$800 for longest time before the scalper boom past year and half. Now people might say wait... theres 15 signature card types, so pulling a specific one is significantly harder, so value should be higher. But i argue that the difference in Pokemon comparison is theres no cards (except rayquaza) from that set that came even close to the price point. So until the characters popularity come into play, they should all be around the same value and highly tradable. Just something to consider. Seeing the chinese market i would say English signature should be around $400-$600. That being said we saw what leesin sold and people are asking $2k already. But in a month hundreds of signed cards will flood the market cutting that in half or more id imagine. What are your thoughts?",

I was ecstatic. kept that card for 20 years. I recently restarted collecting cards and noticed that everything changed. the price are out of this world, there are 200 different flavors you can buy. and they are all upper-deck. after some digging I came to pinpoint the culprit to be the diamond classification upper deck attributes to a dealer. this essencially killed the moms and pops card shop, now only huge stores remain where there is pressure to buy and where the kids can't afford sh1t all and are seen as a semi-nuisance. it got me somewhat angry.. I hated my experience, in fact I buy exclusively online now, I have not traded or sold a card since I restarted a few years back because there are no community, events or places where you can exchange about your passion, beside online forums with mostly trolls. kids cannot use ebay, or any of these trading apps. kids do not work, kids cannot generate 13$/day to buy a pack of cards. how the hell, is this hobby supposed to survive if it behaves like amateur radio boomers. the kids are left aside.. the future of the hobby is trampled on (and as a byproduct, the ",

          "text": "Most ‘I Buy Sports Cards’ Buyers Disappear When You Mention eBay Sold Prices 😅😭 I recently messaged about 20 local buyers who advertise that they purchase sports cards. I told them I have a large collection with many high value pieces. For several of them, I even sent photos of some of my better cards. Almost all of them asked whether I had cards of specific players (including rookies), and I said yes. In the end, I explained that my collection is very large I have cards from almost every sport and many players. I said if someone wants to buy in person, I’m willing to sell below market, roughly 70% of market value for most items, and I’d do my best to make a deal. I also said I would price based on recent eBay sold listings. As soon as I mentioned eBay sold comps, most of them lost interest. So I’m asking, do these people actually want to buy cards... or are they trying to pressure sellers into letting valuable collections go at unreasonably low prices? Unfortunately, scammers and predatory buyers are everywhere. Please be careful. My advice to fellow collectors _Don’t let strangers set your prices. Always check recent eBay sold listings (not asking prices) and use that as your baseline. _Know your range. If you need quick cash, decide your discount in advance (e.g., 70–85% of market depending on card/liquidity). Don’t let someone talk you down further on the spot. _Meet safely & in public if selling locally. _Be cautious with “I buy collections” posts. 🚨😅 Many of these buyers only want deep discounts far below comps. If someone refuses to use sold data, that’s a red flag. _Remember you have options. If you’re patient, you can sell online a little below market and still do better than a lowball local offer. Stay safe, do your own research, and protect the value of your collection",

My dad passed away about 4 years ago and left my sister and me millions of sports cards — mostly baseball but some other sports too. He had them valued at over $120k at one point and was really into eBay buying and selling. He had thousands of cards graded and kept a detailed price book, but we honestly can’t make sense of any of it. We don’t know how to spot the more valuable cards or where to even start. We’re also realistic that we’ll probably take a loss if we sell everything, but we don’t want to just give away something that might have value. What’s the best approach for handling something like this? Are there apps, websites, or services that can help identify or value cards efficiently?",

It was in a one touch that had the Breakers logo covering the magnet. The sticker was put on all totally crooked and there was nothing on the card that it was an official topps autographed card. The guy got mad because I wouldn't take it. Later on that day I found out some company or breakers have the rights to buy signed sticker sheets and put them on cards. I had never heard of that. I am trying to show my boss an example of one of these cards. I found one from the same company on ebay yesterday while looking up the specific card I was looking at in the shop, but I can't find the listing now. If anyone can help me find the listing, I would be really grateful. Im pretty sure it was the base card #ra-jwo. It was still in the one piece with the breaker sticker and it had the crooked sticker like the one that was in my store. Being that was the only listing I could find it sort of justified my thinking that something wasn't right.",

A few immediate red flags popped up for me - 1) I sold as a set of 3, non sequentially numbered, but if 1 was “fake” then wouldn’t the whole set be? 2) buyer purchased in late July. Why are they reaching out now? 3) whenever I am in possession of a graded card/item, I do my due diligence and verify the cert number. When I originally bought the card that the buyer is claiming to be fake, it showed up on the website with a picture. Did the buyer just blindly buy my item and not research herself? Was the card reported “stolen” after I sold it, between date of sale and when she reached back out? Any help appreciated",

          "text": "How I turned a 400$ commercial zero turn to 2,000$ (my 4th mower flip) Picked up this 2007 Yazoo Kees Mid Max commercial zero turn mower after talking the seller down from $750 to $400. It wasn’t some blown-up, hopeless project, the motor already ran fine. The seller just couldn’t keep it mowing because it kept shredding belts (likely from improper routing). When I got it, the mower was dirty and unable to move under its own power. The motor itself ran strong, so I figured it was worth the gamble. I ended up replacing the drive belt and putting on a deck belt, swapped in a new ignition solenoid and 25A fuse (one-time issue I tracked down), added some fuel stabilizer/cleaner to flush out old gas gunk, and eventually had to put on new rear tires after puncturing one while mowing my own yard (previous where already tubed and dry rotted, but did hold air) Total labor was maybe 6 hours spread over a weekend. After cleaning it up and putting about 8 hours of mowing on it myself, I listed it and sold for $2,000 cash in just two weeks. The numbers worked out great: purchase price was $400, total parts and supplies were about $400, so I was all-in for $800. Sold for $2,000, which left me with a $1,200 profit. This was my fourth riding mower flip, and honestly the smoothest. And I’m nowhere near done so expect to see more from this page!",

The card quality is typical of donruss from that period, which means there can be centering issues or soft corners sometimes. The card itself is relatively abundant, making it more affordable for many collectors. **1989 Fleer #548** The 1989 fleer card showcases walker in a batting stance. The fleer sets of the late 80s are known for their occasionally poor quality control, especially with print defects.This particular card, while common, can fetch a premium if it's well-centered and free from any markings or damage. **1989 Score #404** The 1989 score card presents walker in an action shot fielding a ball.

          "text": "Definitive How-To: How to look up, price or identify a card # What is this card worth? Please consider the following before asking and conduct your own research. * Search for the card on ebay and filter for sold listings. Don't rely on what an ebay listing is asking for as a sale price. I can print out a black and white picture of Tom Brady, call it a rookie card and ask for $1,000 for it, but that doesn't make it worth $1,000. Go by sold listings, not by asking prices! * Search [130point.com](http://130point.com) which includes older ebay sales and other sales platforms. * Signed-in users can see sale history on [COMC.com](http://COMC.com) * Finding similar comps: * If it's a /25 but you can't find any /25 sales, look for other serial numbered sales like /40 or /20 etc from that year or similar sets from a year or two before and after. * If it's a non-numbered auto, look for that player's auto in another set or product # Identifying a card Before you can search for the value of a card, you have to know what the card is in the first place. Several sites offer checklists, I will use Beckett's [checklist](https://www.beckett.com/news/2024-panini-prizm-football-cards/) and I'll use 2024 Panini Prizm as the example in this how-to. Several sites provide checklists. I mostly use checklists from Beckett, [Cardboard Connection](https://www.cardboardconnection.com/) and [Trading Card Database](https://www.tcdb.com/). And before we can properly look up a card, it's helpful to know the main card types: * **Base, insert, parallel**: These are the three main card types. Base are base. These are the majority of cards found in a pack or box. They are the \"commons.\" * **Inserts**, from Prizm, can be Emergent, Fireworks, Hype, Portals, to name a few. Inserts can also be autographs or patch/memorabilia cards. These are kind of like themes within a card product. Emergent, as an example, are all rookies. Inserts will have a style that is visually different from the base. There are also",

I did tell him he could buy it and if he doesn't like it I will buy it back off him providing the condition is the same for 10% less.",

          "text": "Micro SD Express Card Guide for Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of storage right out of the box. However, if you own/buy a lot of games and would like to upgrade to a higher capacity of storage, you'll need a **Micro SD Express card.** These are different from normal Micro SD, Micro SDHC, and Micro SDXC cards, denoted by the **EX** on the card. Normal Micro SD card speeds range from [2-312MB/s](https://www.kingston.com/en/blog/personal-storage/memory-card-speed-classes). However, to bring Nintendo Switch 2 somewhat closer in line with speeds that the SSDs that PS5 and Xbox Series consoles use, the system requires the use of high-speed \"Express\" memory. These speeds are upwards of 600-900MB/s. The good news is that your Nintendo Switch 2 games will load faster. Both the system and cartridges for Nintendo Switch 2 utilize the Express technology which have led to the high prices of these cards for publishers and the creation of the \"Game Key Card\" to avoid this extra cost. But overall, new games for the console will load much faster. The bad news: **your old Micro SD cards that you've been using for Nintendo Switch will** ***NOT*** **work on your Nintendo Switch 2 for storing game data**–inserting your current Micro SD card will only show your screenshots and videos, but you cannot play games off of them, be it Switch 1 or Switch 2 games. Micro SD Express cards are relatively new, but you can find some already on the market if you'd like to purchase one for Nintendo Switch 2. The small variation in the speeds of these cards are a miniscule difference and likely won't matter in everday gaming use. ***Note - be careful you buy an \"Express\" card, and not an \"Extreme\" card, as Extreme cards are not Express.*** Again, look for the \"EX\" on the card itself. If it has the EX logo, you're in the clear. **Micro SD Express cards in the US:** ***128GB EX*** · SanDisk - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-128GB-microSD-Express-SDSQXFN-128G-GN4NN/dp/B0DFQKQ9",

          "text": "(NOT A DEAL) An attempted guide at buying EVERY Scarlet & Violet set online at retail in 2025 Hey r/PokemonDealsUK ! Firstly, apologies for a post that's not really focused on a good deal. Please forgive me! As we all know, the hobby has grown in popularity significantly over the last few months which has been great to see. We've got more budding collectors and shiny cardboard enthusiasts than we've had for a fair few years in the UK now, but the consequence of this which we've all learned the hard way is that actually finding product to rip and good deals to save money is becoming increasingly difficult. Now over the last few weeks, I've experienced far too many people from brand new collectors to stressed parents complain in public, on this subreddit or over on r/PokemonTCG_UK about how they can't find stock for any set anywhere. So that's basically the inspiration for this post. I imagine most frustrations will understandably be aimed at Prismatic Evolutions, but I figured I'd create this post to highlight how you can buy any set from the Scarlet and Violet era of Pokemon cards. If this post can even help just one person out, then my work is done! Before getting into it, a few potentially pointless things to note: - If you'd like to try your luck in public, your priority stores are places like: Smyths, WHSmith, Waterstones, GAME and HMV. Supermarkets can be good too but stock has dried up a lot from my own personal experience. - I've not checked every single online store, so if you can find even better deals, that's great! - Extending on the above, I've not checked Amazon as their URLs are too long, same for eBay too. But a few sets have Booster Bundle Boxes available. - While the standard retail price of a single pack is £4.29 (not counting special sets), these prices differ for other sealed products like Blisters and Elite Trainer Boxes and the price per pack (PP) is higher. Just chucking this in to be safe. - For a couple of sets, it was basically impossible t",

          "text": "My wife went to the billiards store to get me a new cue as a birthday present... Luckily they told her it’s a real personal decision. So today on my special day when I came downstairs for my day off her credit card was sitting there with a note. I have been using a Star cue with a G-core shaft for the last 10+ years. Thought it was a decent cue when I bought it but also thought it was American made. Either way, it has been a great cue over the years but I haven’t played regularly again until recently as my 10 year old has shown some skill and enjoyment for the game. So I happened to be shopping for the last few months. I had decided between a couple McDermott cue’s but hadn’t ruled out other manufacturers. Wanted a carbon shaft, was thinking thinner diameter but wasn’t sold on it. I read through the cue guides here on this sub-reddit which helped me open up my criteria a bit. I had some cues saved on eBay as that seemed to have the most inventory. But after waking up to that note. I figured I’d open up my requirements even more and see what the local shop had. Now this isn’t a hole in the wall billiards shop. It’s a nice shop in a nice good sized city that sells nice stuff. They were going to be fine with or without my business, but that move with my wife sold me. I rode up to the shop thinking of those eBay Cue’s and how they were exactly what I wanted. I got to the shop and found 3 cues that matched my criteria. One Cuetec, one McDermott, and a wildcard Bull all carbon that was a winner on price. I was also waiting for the McDermott cue of the month as that would be another cool thing but this months cue was just announced and it hits zero of my wants (though the price is ideal). So that was no longer delaying my purchase. The McDermott happened to be this pictured SL10C cue of the month from last November and it was priced at the exact price of the eBay one I was watching. They had the exact cue I wanted at the same price as online! Happy Birthday indeed. It was ",

          "text": "Massive Complete Set Collection (please help) I’m looking for a bit of help from the community on pricing and selling a really large complete collection of Topps cards. Thanks in advance for your help! I’ve read the pricing guide but it still leaves a few questions. First I’ll list what I have. Complete Sets of Series 1,2,3 in both holo and non holo - all blue label Complete Sets of Mewtwo Strikes Back and Pokemon 2000 in both holo and non holo - all blue label Additionally I have (all complete sets): - series 1 holo black label - series 1 and 2 non holo blue label - series 3 holo blue label - non holo pokemon 2000 blue label. My biggest question is that I am wondering how to go about pricing and selling all of this. I’ve checked recently sold on eBay and have comps for some.of it, but not all. I’m also curious if it might make sense to list the entire Blue Label complete set as one item, then list the duplicates and extras on their own. It’s all been in binders, sleeves, cases or sleeves and top loaders since about 2000, most of it is LP-NM, some of it is mint. I added some pictures of some of the pages / top loaders etc for reference. Thanks again for taking the time to read this post :) Also - I have some miscellaneous duplicates and bulk of all these sets, holo and non holo, that I’d be happy to send off to someone if they were able to help me get this all ready to sell!",

I wanted to list a working 16TB hard drive, eBay suggested BIN of $11. eeeehhhhh????? Even a non-working 16TB HD is more than $50 so I have no idea why eBay thought this specific brand and model should be sold at $11. I sell LEGO set that I pick up locally at clearance sale and had a couple of 76419 that I picked up for $80 new, they normally go for $170 retail price and a few on eBay for more than $100 used. What did eBay suggest for my 76419, new in box? $22 each!! I really wish I can turn off suggested price permanently because it's using unreliable AI that can't account for condition and/or completeness, and may have grabbed data off someone's replacement firmware chip for the hard drive or a gold colored minifig out of that LEGO set and assumed it represented the whole thing. PS multiple choice listing sucks too. $100 item with $0.99 microfiber cloth makes them show up first when sorted by cheapest. Also keep out of stock listing sucks, they show up weeks and even months as OOS to draw buyer who would think look at seller's other item and end up with a much more expensive item.",

If you are Unaware, new to hobby, been around, any and everyone, please do some research before over spending on Cards that are no where worth these inflated prices. Dont be buying cards out of fear of missing out, patience is key, save your money, more always come along. Leave them with their copies, dont allow them to Profit. They will have to Dump them back eventually. Prices will come back down to reality. Now If you are an outsider to all this and are thinking of selling some of these inflated Cards, thinking its worth 5x or so more now, it really isnt. Expect people to low ball you with realistic prices on Ebay, or where ever you sell. Community needs to tighten up and smarten up. Thanks.

If you've been following either this sub or the / r / gold sub for longer than a minute then you've probably been able to see this debate in the comments section. I'm planning on an FAQ for this subreddit because this topic comes up so often. Sorry, this is a longish post. There's something that the / r / gold folks understand that is being missed or at least not fully acknowledged from the Goldback side of the community in these debates that may be worth acknowledging here: **Not all gold with premiums are good investments and they may cause a financial loss vs. other forms of gold that run closer to the melt value. In fact, as a general rule, the further away from spot you are, the higher the risk and volatility is.** There have been hundreds, if not thousands of different fractional gold products that have been sold for high premiums, only to be sold for melt or lower down the line. These include fractional bars, fractional coins, and even \"Aurum\" (The technology behind the Goldback). \"Aurum\" in particular has a mixed record. There have been hundreds of \"aurum\" products before the Goldback was invented that have been sold at a steep discount, and ultimately melted down. Most of these were novelties or collectibles with no real or established user bases. There is usually no or little liquidity in other aurum products outside the Goldback. We don't even generally allow other non-Goldback \"aurum\" products to be promoted here. Even 1/10th ounce gold coins minted by the U.S. government have volatile premiums ranging from 10% to 90%+ depending on demand. They are hardly a great deal historically at 90% compared to 10%. The people coming here and calling the Goldback a scam see a gold product with a 100% markup over spot and are concerned. Some of them are rude or here in bad faith but there are good, educated people that see the potential danger. There is a real risk of losing half of your value on the Goldback",

I'm recently disabled with a brain injury, and I was trying to figure out what I should do to price these fairly. They're cib, cases are dusty and such, but the manuals and discs are clean. I'm asking because I've been selling things on eBay recently, and showed one of my friends what I was got for them, and he was really disappointed because he said I let everything go for way too little. I'm trying to sell this stuff because I need money for groceries, got an ebt card but no money to get groceries delivered (had to give most of my money away from my sales to my family, just cause rent is a problem as well). I'm pretty desperate since I'm mostly run out of high value items in my collection, and letting go of the few remaining ones would be a little too painful (had let go of my PS2, PSX, and cyberpunk manga collection a few months ago, and it still really hurts 😭).

          "text": "Are sellers allowed to use the comment tool on feedback to expose full names/addresses/ebay usernames? I recently had a bad experience with a seller who tried to skirt off of the guidelines of eBay. They tried to be dishonest by sending me the wrong item (I paid for a 2 dollar card and they sent me one worth pennies) and when I reached out about the \"issue\" they tried to blame USPS and told me to \"tell Ebay I never received the item\". I refused to do that because, frankly, it wasn't possible. The ebay tracking put the item at my door, and their username was on the envelope but the item inside was incorrect. They then tried to say it was USPS fault. I said I'd be submitting for a refund and they initially denied it, then when I pushed back, they said they would let me return it but would \"send me the postage\" not through ebay. Of course that didn't happen so I had to call eBay to get my refund. This person has done this to several other people, and has a habit apparently on any negative feedback given to comment on their own. They've identified full street addresses, full names, and ebay usernames, as well as called people \"stupid\" and \"POS\" in the messages. I've reported this defamation and abuse to Ebay, but every report that's been \"reviewed\" says there's nothing wrong with the content. So, is that true? Are sellers allowed to call buyers stupid and leak their full names and/or addresses if they get a bad review? Is that not a form of retaliation? UPDATE: Spoke with Ebay customer service. The service rep sounded pretty shocked at the comments done on negative/neutral feedback by the buyer and said it wasn't okay. Said they would escalate the situation because their conduct is inappropriate.",

I am completely new to mtg, im 23 and remember all the way back to middle school when a kid was playing some kind of blue colored mill deck, and at some point talked about how awesome slivers are. Eventually I asked my dad for my birthday for some slivers some time shortly after I saw that kid playing. For my birthday I got the sliver overlord, hivelord, gemhide, the poison one, and the blue swimming one (i forget both of their names). I never once played any matches, but the cards were cool and I still have them! Now my buddy recently got into magic, and in turn he got me into magic. Both because they're fricking cool and for nostalgia reasons I want to make a sliver deck. Ideally a really good one. We want to play commander format, since he has a commander LOTR deck. From what ive read, slivers are better off as a commander deck than standard anyways so yippee. What I want advice on is what is the best way to go about getting a 100 card sliver deck? Ive looked on ebay, and there are quite a few prebuilt decks for around 300-400$. Ouchie thats a lot of moola for a newbie. Im not stranger to spending lots of money on things I dont need, but is there a better way to go about creating the deck I want? (Granted idk exactly what I want, I just want as good of a sliver commander deck as I can get) Should I just buy each one as singles instead of a prebuilt? Wouldn't that get even more ridiculously expensive because of the shipping costs on 100 individually shipped cards? Also, I kind of want to have more than just the 100 cards. Say I buy a prebuilt for around 300-400$, that's still only 100 cards, many of which are just lands and some generic spells or artifacts anyways. So maybe I could try to collect multiples and get as many uniques as there are. (the hive must grow so to speak) I understand some specific cards like sliver queen may be super pricey. I also understand that slivers may not be a top tier deck at all anymor",

So, I research and study. Learn everything I can so I can do this well. I went all in and things were going great. In about a month I sold 15 items, a few of which were higher ticket and one was much higher ticket. And I am packing like a crazy person because I care, shipping at least next day. Items get delivered, get a couple glowing reviews. I'm loving it. Really seeing how I can make this into something. But I'm also not getting paid. I have funds ready to be released and one on hold. I understand there is a waiting period that's fine. But I'm not getting paid anything. I have only been paid out on the very first item I ever sold which was sold on Jan. 2nd. I have items that were delivered on the 16th and earlier and haven't been paid. I'm thinking, new account selling a decent amount right away and selling more expensive items, too. Understandable I might have to wait a bit. No problem, I guess. I heard that goes away once you have more time on the platform. Then tonight, I find my account is restricted and I need to verify my ID and also upload tracking for an order that I had just received. I upload my ID. No big deal. Kind of weird since you have all my info and bank details but fraud exists so I get it. But I don't have tracking for this new order obviously. So, I reach out. Ebay assistant is laughably awful.

          "text": "One Piece TCG Investing will inevitably fail (One Piece vs Pokemon) One Piece TCG Investing has got to be some of the stupidest type of investments possible. This is coming from me being a little salty that OP14 is impossible to find, but also it's just objectively a stupid investments. So many Pokebros coming to OP since it's a newer game and they're thinking that a booster box will hit the same peaks as Pokemon. But because Pokebros have tiny IQs, they didn't bother doing any research into thousands of dollars in investments, so let me break it down for everyone. **Sealed Product Investment is almost universally a shitty investment for One Piece.** How often are you pulling an alt art from a Pokemon Booster Box? It ranges from 2-5 roughly. How often are you pulling an alt art from a one piece booster box? Guaranteed 2-3 alt arts/sec. So you're thinking, OP and Pokemon are roughly the same. This is missing so much context though it's crazy. In a booster box of One Piece, since you know that there's only 2-3 hits, if you pulled 3 hits, you can throw the rest of the unopened [single packs on ebay](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/450085/one-piece-card-game-romance-dawn-romance-dawn-booster-pack?Language=English&page=1). That's why generally speaking, informed OPTCG players and collectors will never buy single packs on the secondary market unless you just like collecting packs. Compare this to Pokemon, where Pokemon cannot be mapped and so every single pack has an equal chance to get a hit. This leads to one pack of Prismatic Evolutions will statistically more likely to have hits than any one One Piece pack. (This is ignoring weighing which I know the oldest pokemon sets can be weighed). Once people catch on that OP single packs are almost dead packs, the price for OP single packs will drop drastically and are not a good investment. *But I invested in Booster Boxes*? Booster boxes can be mapped too. In a case of One Piece booster boxes (12 boxes), generally speaking ",

          "text": "Best Sports Card Scanner App I've Found – Baseball Card Values, PSA Grading Estimates & More Been lurking on this sub for a while and always see people asking how to value their collections. Last month I inherited a shoebox full of my dad's old baseball cards from the 80s and 90s – we're talking hundreds of cards with no idea what's junk and what's gold. I spent hours manually searching eBay sold listings before giving up. Tried a couple apps but the recognition was hit or miss. Then a buddy at my LCS mentioned SnapCard and honestly it's been a game changer for organizing everything. **What I actually like about it:** * **The sports card scanner is stupid fast** – just snap a photo of any baseball card, basketball card, or football card and it identifies it almost instantly. Saved me so much time going through that shoebox. * **Real-time price guide pulls from actual sold data** – not just random asking prices. It aggregates from eBay, Goldin, Heritage Auctions, and PWCC so you're seeing what cards actually sell for. * **The PSA grading estimates are surprisingly accurate** – I was skeptical about the AI grading analysis, but I sent in 5 cards to PSA and the app predicted 4 of them exactly right (missed one by half a grade). Also does Beckett grading and SGC grading estimates if that's your preference. * **Collection manager actually works** – I can finally track my card collection value over time instead of random spreadsheets. **Cards it supports:** Works with pretty much everything I've thrown at it – baseball cards, basketball cards, football cards, hockey cards, even my kid's Pokemon cards and some MTG cards I had lying around. Basically covers sports cards and trading card games. **Not perfect though:** * Vintage cards pre-1970 can be spotty on recognition * Wish there was a web version for bulk scanning * Some of the market trends data could be more detailed **Who it's good for:** If you're a casual collector with a pile of cards you need to sort through, or ",

          "text": "Can I escalate to the Financial Ombudsman if eBay refund buyers using my pending funds without responding to my complaint? Hi, I’m from England and I’m seeking legal advice on this situation. I sold three orders totalling around £2,000 using eBay’s “Simple Delivery” service (which includes Royal Mail tracking and lost-parcel coverage). Two of the parcels haven’t moved since they were scanned into the Royal Mail system, so the buyers opened “item not received” cases. Shortly after, my account was suspended — I suspect because of those two lost parcels, though eBay haven’t confirmed. I was told my payments would be held for 190 days, which I was okay with. However, eBay refunded both buyers using my pending funds, leaving me around £1,500 out of pocket. On the case screen, it said I didn’t need to take any action, and since Simple Delivery is meant to include coverage for lost parcels, I assumed both sides would be protected. I’ve already sent a formal complaint to eBay’s complaints email (confirmed by a customer service agent), but I haven’t received a response yet. My legal question is: If eBay don’t respond to my complaint within 15 days, how do I get a final response letter so I can escalate the issue — and would that go to CEDR or the Financial Ombudsman Service, given that it involves withheld seller funds and refunds taken from my pending balance? Any legal guidance on how to proceed would be really appreciated.",

It should be 1.99 x 13.25% = 25 CENTS FOR THEM IF ANYTHING not the fucking shipping label AND the item itself combined to take A WHOLE DOLLAR WHILE I GET CENTS!!! 0.87$ is what i made when realistically it SHOULD HAVE BEEN 1.25 or A FUCKING DOLLAR AMOUNT!!😀😀😀 im about to switch over to actual comic book websites cause atleast (i think) their honest about the fees they’ll charge and take. Don’t give me the “ohhh its ebay thats just how they make their” THEY MAKE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO JUST TAKE THE DAMN QUARTER ANS GIVE THE SELLER THE DOLLAR THAT HE IS RIGHTFULLY OWED!!!!

          "text": "Sports Card Bulk Add to My Collection via CSV - Purchase Price Error Need Help Hello Everyone, I am trying to bulk add Sports Cards to my Ebay Collection through a CSV for the purpose of selling later. I am testing it out with a couple cards and I keep getting an error \"Rows 2-11 Property \"purchasePrice\" with value \"0.19\" is invalid\" - I changed the price to 1 and then it worked but of course I didn't pay a dollar per card, I paid 19 cents. I know ebay only wants numbers in this field and no symbols ($ for example) but in the example they provided, they were using a period for cents so I don't know why this isn't working. Very frustrated and any help would be appricated! Thanks!",

The seller has now taken $100 off my return because \"it's been used\" I bought a full-size bottle of perfume from an Ebay seller a few weeks ago. Looking back, this was a dumb decision. The seller had about 30,000 sales and a 5 star average review. Still, I should have looked into this more. This was my own dumb mistake that I won't be making again, however... As soon as I received the item I got a bad feeling it was a fake. There was a sticker on the plastic wrap of the box saying it was made in China. When I took off the wrapping, the box was a bit dented and scuffed. The inside of the box was discolored as well. The bottle of perfume was slightly scratched and the cap to the bottle was scuffed up. I gave the seller the benefit of the doubt, though. Maybe this bottle had fallen off some truck and still could be authentic. However, I have a sample of this perfume already and I sprayed this bottle all of 1 time and it smelled nothing like the sample I have. I know this is a fake. It was sold as a new, sealed box authentic item. I immediately requested a refund, which was immediately accepted. The next day I dropped the package off at the post office with all of the materials I received included in the package (plastic wrap, sticker, bubble wrap, etc.) I just received an email saying the seller is only giving me half of my refund ($90 out of a $180 purchase) because \"it wasn't returned in the original condition\" and \"the item was opened used by the buyer\". This seems a little harsh to me considering a) this is a counterfeit item that I could not have known was counterfeit until I opened the box and sprayed the perfume, and b) the only difference between the condition I received it in and the condition I sent it back in was some opened plastic wrap and 1 spray out of a 75mL bottle of fake perfume. I'm wondering if I have any recourse for this. I know I can \"ask Ebay to step in\" by basically su",

I have gone through Ebay documentation about taxes and come out with no better understanding of the additional taxes and fees. I'm not in a special taxing district. Any ideas? https://preview.redd.it/lyb1r3vanvig1.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=152d74e44207d99897c0c0869ccd8b83775381de Recap; 1. I'm in NJ. Shipping address is NJ. 2. Seller is also in NJ, though that probably doesn't matter. 3. NJ has one sales tax rate for the whole state. Lower municipalities are not allowed any additional taxes. 4. I contacted eBay. They take no responsibility and say I should contact the company that does the calculation for them; Vertex. 5. Vertex website says if you have questions contact eBay. 6. When I pushed eBay they declared the amount is \"correct\" but will not provide any detail for the tax breakdown. 7. I'm not saying eBay is wrong, I just want an explanation. I put the same item in a cart at BestBuy and moved to checkout.

          "text": "Ebay Envelope (Sports Cards) and Combined Shipping - Does Anyone Have the Answer? I have been selling with Ebay for several years with very few issues. I use the Ebay Standard Envelope (ESE) regularly for listings under $20. But there are a couple of scenarios where I can't seem to find solid answers for what feels like an easily solved issue. **Scenario 1** \\- I have started using variation listings to sell very inexpensive cards. There are listings for base inserts at about .99 cents each and heavily discounted. I have shipping set to ESE, with Priority Mail as a secondary, with each individual item assigned a weight of 1oz. Often, a buyer will purchase 6 or 7 cards, which works out to 6 or 7 ounces. ESE only accommodates up to 3 ounces, but Ebay still allows the buyer to purchase ESE even though it won't allow me to at shipping time. So I am forced to use Ground Advantage and eat $3 in shipping. So I changed these listings to flat rate of $1.75 with $1.25 for each additional item so that if they purchased 4-5, there'd be enough to cover priority if they didn't select it themselves. But then I had guys buying 20 cards and paying $25+ in shipping for Ebay envelope because they didn't pick priority at checkout. So then I have to manually refund the difference. Is there no way for the listing to auto-swap to priority once 3 oz is exceeded? I can't just ship Priority on these because no one wants to pay $5 shipping on a $1 card. **Scenario 2** \\- This is the first time this has happened to me. I had 3 separate cards listed for under $20 each. A customer purchased all 3, but apparently combined shipping and only paid $1.32 for a single Ebay envelope for $25+ in purchases. It looks like Ebay is going to allow me to purchase the ESE...but now the cards won't be fully covered by insurance. Why were they allowed to select ESE after combining their orders? Any/all help greatly appreciated.",

I have a couple of questions: 1) is it advisable? A part of me says no because if I'm the one paying and organizing for the insured shipment, in case of problems the buyer would open a case against me and me against the courier, but if the buyer is paying the courier, they could then open a case for missing receipt of the item as well a case against the courier 2) in case it is, how to deal with that on eBay? Proceed as usual but require a tracking code to put on the item selling before giving the package to the courier, so that the actual tracking is guaranteed? Thank you!",

The item was then delivered to the buyer on Thursday, and a return request was started today with the reason being “ordered by mistake”, which was hard to believe as I discussed shipment details with the buyer prior to shipment. I declined the return request and then 10 minutes later I received a payment dispute with the reason being “The item doesn't match the description in your listing.”. I supplied additional photos of the item in the dispute, as well as the screenshot of the return request where the buyer stated basically that they wanted to return the device for buyers remorse. How long can I expect a payment dispute to last? Anything else I should do?",

Firstly, it was advertised as an estate sale on the local ES Facebook page, but it was not a \"real\" estate sale. More of a \"the family took anything worthwhile and this is all that's left\" and the person was still very much alive and still in the house. The contents of the house were probably emptied 75%. The sale was being conducted by the caregiver, who very obviously never hosted an estate sale, nor had any idea how they work or had ever been to one. She was running the whole show by herself, a very moronic thing to do. There was no hold table, no checkout table, no organization, and barely anything was priced. So if you found an item without a price (90% of everything there), you had to wait until she was done talking to someone and try to flag her down. I found something I could have sold for around $150, IF it worked, and there was no easy way to test it on the spot. I come up to her and ask, and she instantly pulls out Google Lens. \"Oh, this one is selling for $500, this one is selling for $600..\" Except she was looking at active listings. So \"selling for\" was not the right thing to say. Before I could even begin to negotiate, 3 more people come up to her for prices, and again she just pulls out Google Lens and starts spouting off eBay prices. They all just sat the items down on the spot and walked off. I'm carrying this heavy thing around with me for like 10 minutes as she keeps running around like a chicken with its head cutoff, stopping every 20 feet for someone asking about a price. I told her \"No offense mam, but I can sell this item for $150, and that's IF it works, the ones you saw are newer models (which was true) and these are about a 50/50 chance of working and they're not easy to repair, I'm offering $50, take it or leave it\". She starts talking to me and gets interrupted yet again by someone asking for prices, and she forgets I was even talking ",

Spent days on end tinkering, trying apps, setting up launchers, getting meta data, installing apps and pushing the thing as far as I can with HD packs and the like. The thing is, now I have pretty much everything up and running, I find myself not really using it. I think I enjoyed the tinkering and problem solving of getting things to run, such as gamehub/ gamenative games, project Zomdriod, the 3ds HD packs and Wii U controls for Mario Galaxy. Now most things either run well or I've hit a wall where they aren't likely to according to various community sources, I find myself going to play something much as Pokemon ZA on Eden or FF Crisis Core on Gamenative and end up just switching to my MSI Claw, Switch 2 or PS5/ PS Portal as generally the MSI handles emulation better or being Windows can just run the games without needing emulation and obviously the PS5 and Switch 2 play things without issue. I love the duel screens, but at nearly 44, outside of nds, wii U or 3ds, I don't really use both unless I'm reading a guide while trying to sort something out as I don't have the brain power to play a game and actually take in anything in a meaningful way other than what's on the top screen without pausing. So I'm wondering, now the tinkering is done, is it worth hanging onto for anything outside of 3DS emulation and smaller form factor than my Claw. The prices for them on Ebay here in the UK are going for around the price I paid for it or more and I'm just worried that now I don't seem to be using as much, it will decrease in value as the batches get shipped out and I'll lose money if I decide to part with it in the near future. Anyone have any hot takes to talk me into/ out of selling?",

I have good service status with 100 % and it has been confirmed from a capable supporter a month ago that my status is not the issue. ebay does this randomly. when I call the hotline the person is so clueless they don't even know what ebay is doing and I have to repeatedly explain to them, who supposedly are experts, that my issue is general and not specific to a certain sale. the support quality is so low it is not funny. it is not that I do not get what ebay does here, but there is zero transparancy, the supporters aren't informed, there is no time line, no outlook. on top of course the system does not work, meaning usually at least one item hangs where supposedly everything went well, but ebay still recognizes it as not ready for payout. this post got removed without any reasoning from the main ebay sub.",

A chunk of them - buying and selling - have been on eBay, but it seems like I am the only one that has to follow the rules on that platform. When I send in an offer on a BIN price, I get a pop up that tells me exactly how much my credit card will be charged if the offer is accepted. The moment a seller accepts it, my card gets charged and the transaction is finalized. However, more and more frequently of late, someone will send me an offer on a BIN listing that I have up, I will accept it and..... nothing. It just sits in limbo. It's not listed under the \"Awaiting Payment\" section but, if I go to manage offers, I see it's listed as \"pending\" and has a grayed out \"awaiting payment\" logo next to the price. Nothing ever happens and that's it. No sale. On auctions, when I bid on something, I also get a popup telling me what I will be paying, and that all bids are binding. The auction ends and, if I win, my card gets charged a couple hours later and that's it. Deal is done. However, when I set up my own auctions, people will bid on my item, win the auction and..... nothing. No payment. Nothing. It just sits there. I've had this happen six times in my last forty auctions. I even have the settings in my seller dashboard to restrict people with \"non-payment\" marks from bidding on my items. I do not want them..... yet I always seem to find them. How is it that all my bids and offers are \"FINAL\" and everyone else's seem not to be? Are there more settings that I'm missing? Does eBay just not give a shit?",

          "text": "Do I owe taxes on eBay sales if I never received the money? Hello, I'm in a difficult situation and need advice. A friend asked to use my eBay account in December 2025. They made $14,000 in sales (after eBay fees, before cost of goods). My bank account was linked but eBay never paid out. eBay suspended my account in January 2026 before any payout. **Current situation:** \\- $14,000 in sales (Dec 2025) \\- Account suspended (Jan 2026) \\- Funds still held by eBay \\- Never received a single penny in my bank account \\- Friend says he can't pay me and will only pay \"once eBay releases the funds\" \\- Research shows eBay can hold funds 180+ days on suspended accounts **Questions**: 1. Do I owe taxes on the $14,000 for 2025 even though I never received the money? 2. How do I handle this on my tax return when the funds are still held? 3. What if eBay never releases the funds? I don't have invoices for cost of goods (friend was supposed to provide them but hasn't). I'm in Canada if that matters. I'm really stressed about owing taxes on money I never got. I'd really appreciate any help and advice in this matter.",

This seems like a no brainer. 30% more profit for a simple change? That’s just free profit right? I don’t think its that simple and for most companies I think its a mistake. To break this problem down, you need to figure out: 1. Which is better at the initial transaction? 2. Which is better at recurring transactions? 3. What else should we consider? What we (always) care about on this site, is which of these will make you more money? # Revenue: Initial Transaction You can break the initial transaction into these elements: **Revenue from Initial Purchase** = Checkout Page Conversion x AOV x Initial Payment Processing Success - Refund Rate - Fees Now lets look at each of these elements to see who likely wins this. |Factor|Likely Winner | |:-|:-| |Checkout Page Conversion|App Stores, by a lot. It has a higher degree of trust, saved payment methods, one tap payment (which is huge).| |AOV of Initial Order|Likely a Tie I don’t see any reason these should be different| |Initial Payment Processing Success Rate|App Stores They process 10000x the volume that you do, have a higher merchant rating, use multiple gateways, etc| |Refund Rates|Likely a Tie The giant caveat here is that web checkout can be much worse if you’re not managing the experience well. If the user hits material bugs or friction right after they purchase and don’t activate on your product, you’ll see refunds go up.| |Fees |Web, by a lot Assuming you’re using stripe its “2.9% + $0.3” by default. Both apple and google stores charge 30% by default. 15% for the second year of subscriptions and developers in the SMB program with under $1M of revenue. | **Verdict:** I think the app stores win here. For the web based payments to win, you need a really good checkout page. Even then I think you won’t be able to overcome the power of single click checkout. Cornell did a [study](https://news.c",

Klarna has been giving me an ID Verification error on any purchase I try to make in the app. So I thought if I just put $200 into my Klarna balance I should be able to spend that with no problem in the app. I was wrong. I added the card to my Apple Wallet and tried to pay that way (for a PAY NOW purcase in the Klarna app for an ebay gift card) and it says \"We cannot process your card.\" So I tried using the actual Klarna debit card # for the purcahse and I get the same error. I don't see a way to choose KLARNA BALANCE at checkout. But I show a $200 balance in my account. So now I don't have the $200 in my bank account anymore AND Klarna won't let me spend it. What is going on?! How can I buy a freaking gift card in their app?!? I have been on chat hold for almost 24 hours waiting for a supervisor about the ongoing ID Verification problem. But that shoudn't matter for spending the $ that is in my Klarna balance? Right????",

I was prepared to just send the refund without need for return, but it kept telling me to add a payment method even though ebay has the money held and enough to cover it in ebay, and there was more than enough in my bank account, but would just say it can't process the refund I need to add a payment method I just said to the buyer to just send something back so that ebay will just force a refund once it returns. It has since returned and I have the same error. After contacting ebay asking why is it not just releasing the held funds, they said I should refund from my bank account and then it should release the held funds, I thought that was really strange as I've never had to do that before, but it still won't do it. When going to add a different payment method a window pops up for a brief second and then nothing and just get an error that they couldn't process the refund. I've tried, app, desktop different browsers and nothing. I explained to the buyer and they havent even responded it's at a point they can ask ebay to step in. So what happens will it just time out?",

TDLR: buyer opened chargeback through their CC 147 days after recieving the item Today, i recieved an update from ebay that the dispute details were updated. https://imgur.com/a/TV8O51P I can challenge the dispute of course and they gave me another 5 days to upload screenshots and type, etc. Not sure if this is good news/normal? It has been 17 days since i challenged the dispute the first time, where I only uploaded 2-3 screenshots of me offering open returns to the buyer etc. So far i've gathered 11 total screenshots ranging from conversations with the buyer, signature confirmation by the buyer, etc. UPDATE: i received an email from ebay \"We’re letting you know that this dispute is eligible for eBay Seller Protection. You’re not responsible for the dispute amount and the dispute fee. We’ll close the dispute once we receive the final outcome from the buyer’s payment institution. Right now there’s nothing you need to do.\" I guess this is somehow related to the change in dispute reasoning because if it stayed as \"doesnt match description\" i was most likely going to be scammed out of the bracelet and money. I called ebay who happily informed me (they wouldn't budge on letting me know who the dispute was through, mastercard, visa, etc) that it was through PAYPAL. i was told that no matter what they decide, i would not have to pay a dime. we will see because the same way the customer changed the reason for dispute today, im assuming they can just change it back whenever. Before i respond to the dispute, i wanted to come here and ask for help because that's what i was told to do last time when i responded first, then asked for help second lol.",

It was the launch of the \"Secret Scare Superdrop,\" a highly sought-after collection of premium, limited-edition card sets. But within minutes, that anticipation devolved into a now-familiar ritual of frustration, futility, and fury. Customers who logged on at the 9 a.m. PST launch were thrust into a virtual queue, with wait times ticking into hours. The most agonizing part, however, wasn't the wait. It was the false hope. Multiple players reported the same crushing experience: after finally getting through the queue two hours later, they would successfully add the desired $40 bundles to their cart. They would proceed to checkout, enter their payment and shipping details, and click \"confirm.\" Only then would they be met with an error message: the items were sold out. Their carts were empty. The product had been sold from under them while they were typing in their credit card number. This \"cart jac",

A bit of background: I sold a limited edition Funko Pop (9,500 pcs) on eBay. I uploaded detailed close-up photos showing the box was in perfect condition ,no creases or damage. It sold quickly since I listed it at a lower price than others. The buyer paid immediately, and I shipped the next day. I packed it extremely well: layers of bubble wrap, plenty of padding, and “fragile” tape all around. The Pop was also in a protective case. I even took photos of the packaging before sending it out. The parcel was delivered on October 3rd, but today the buyer requested a return and refund, claiming the box was damaged. I compared the photos, and it’s definitely not the same box I sent it looks like they swapped it. I also checked their profile and saw they resell similar figures for almost double the price. It’s been 8 days since delivery, and I already received my payout. What are my options here? How should I handle it through eBay if I’m confident they switched the item?

I list this as the only shipping type, and there is no issue listing this in this manner setting up the listing. However, on checkout, eBay does not allow me to select large envelope as the shipping type on an order. When I search and find \"large envelope\", it is grayed out and it says that shipping type is not allowed for the class of item. The cheapest shipping allowed on the site is Ground Advantage, which usually costs twice as much. Is there a way to bypass this restriction? I have been marking as shipped and buying postage at USPS, but then it doesn't come with tracking which causes other problems. Thx",

          "text": "How to Charge Tariffs to US Buyers Without Increasing Item Price **UPDATE:** I discovered Etsy only allows one USA price in each weight profile, so I'm using an average of price values ($10, $20, $30, up to $90) for the tarrif value + weight category + new postage prices which are inclusive of tariff handling fees. From Ukraine now this means postage prices has basically become the same as shipping to Australia. Hey fellow flippers, I've been working on a way to handle a common problem for international sellers dealing with the new USA tariffs and how to accurately charge for tariffs and duties to US buyers without inflating the price of the item itself (which then increases the tariff price, if you're thinking to just raise your prices for everyone). I don't want to make my products look more expensive on the main listing page, but I also need to make sure I'm getting paid for the additional costs. I figured out a way to do this using a set of simplified shipping profiles. The trick is to embed the tariff costs directly into the shipping fee for US buyers, so the total price the buyer sees at checkout is correct. This is great because it keeps our product prices competitive on the main page. I came up with an easy system that makes it manageable. Here is the full list of profile names I'm now using, which you can copy and adapt for your own shop (most of my items are under sixty bucks and 4kg, adjust as you need). The price tiers in the names account for both the shipping cost and the tariff. I set a price that is the actual local postal carrier fee (keep in mind many European sellers are suspending shipments to the USA), plus the tariff based on the item price, adding in a $2.25 'service fee' (Ukrposhta says the fee should be $1.50 to $3), and then of course, adding the 18% eBay/Etsy transaction/payment processing fees. Also keep in mind if you are overseas selling on ebay com (as opposed to ebay UK, DE, etc), you can just set up the 'domestic postage' shipping pr",

I have been selling some of my things on my Ebay account to assist me with my bills recently. However, this morning Ebay put my payouts on hold while my account has a 'periodic review'. I spoke with Ebay customer service today and they told me that this review started because I had a noticeable increase in the amount I have sold lately & that it was a standard review. Ebay customer service said it would take likely 5 business days at minimum to finish this review and have my account hold lifted so that I can receive my funds. Since I am in need of these funds now to pay my bills, I am hoping that someone would be willing to loan me the money needed for my bills, and then I could repay them after my account hold is lifted. I am requesting two weeks to pay back the funds as I need to wait at least 5 days for my funds to be released from my Ebay hold and then I will need to have the funds transferred from Ebay to my bank account, which can take another 3-5 days. (Two weeks allows me the time needed plus a few ",

Here’s how to sell smartly: Step 1: Pick Your Platform For speed: Try CardSell (app) or eBay (auction-style, but fees eat profits). For max value: Negotiate P2P (OfferUp, Craigslist). Insist on secure payment (Zelle/Venmo only after verification). Safe trade: Reddit’s r/giftcardexchange or r/GCTrading(Always check the trust and scam lists) Step 2: Price It Right Physical cards fetch 5-10% more than e-codes. Bulk discounts? GiftCardBin buys large quantities (e.g., corporate leftovers). Step 3: Safety Checks Never share PINs before payment. Use escrow services (like Bisq for crypto-minded folks). Fun Fact: Some charities accept gift cards as donations (tax deductible!). What’s your horror story or surprise win? Let’s commiserate/celebrate below.",

Lately I’ve been noticing some random delays with my ebay payouts even though not super frequent but enough to be annoying. Sometimes it’s flagged for review sometimes it just takes longer than usual for no clear reason. I made a couple changes to try and smooth it out. One thing that seemed to help was switching to a US based account fron Adro banking that can receive ACH and wires directly. Since doing that I think things have felt a bit more stable and I think it’s made my seller profile look a bit more established to the platform. I also started reviewing my return policy and shipping settings to see if anything there might be triggering hold ups especially for new buyers. Cleaned up some of my product listings too just made them a bit more US market friendly with clearer shipping times and localized pricing. Still figuring it all out though. Curious if others have run into the same issues. Is this just part of the game, or are there things you’ve done to reduce the friction with payouts?",

Mythic rares and rares often command higher prices,especially if they are staples in popular constructed formats like Standard,Modern,or Commander. However, if a set as a whole is not highly sought after, even these rarer cards can end up in clearance bins.

Hi everyone, I recently started an eBay dropshipping store and quickly realized how painful the reconciliation process is. eBay gives me payouts, and I need to match them with every single supplier transaction. But the supplier side often has delays or missing entries, and manual reconciliation is super time-consuming and error-prone. To save time, I built an automated system that parses and analyzes both sides and flags discrepancies or missing data. It’s made my life a lot easier. Here is the screenshot: [EBay payout screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/qtX4Q7D) I'm curious: * Are you facing the same problem? * Would you consider paying a monthly subscription for a tool that automates this process? * What features would be a must-have for you? Would really appreciate your input — trying to understand if this is a broader pain point in the dropshipping community.",

My apologies if this situation is common for most of you. The seller in question is small. Only 15 items sold and 6 current listings. Among them are a few comics valued between $40-80 each. I won at auction the most valuable of these comics for under $30. Seller then cancelled and refunded payment due to “missing or damaged item.” They then preceded to re-list for auction that same comic, but this time with a starting price double what I just paid. They didn’t even wait a few days! They put the book I won back up for auction immediately after claiming they’d lost it and couldn’t honor my win. I’m so sick of stuff like this. I’d never think of treating my buyers like this. I’ve only been buying and selling for a few months now, and this is the third time something like this happened. I reported it this time cause it was so brazen and insulting. Does anyone know if eBay takes these complaints seriously? It’s upsetting that I can’t leave feedback on this exchange. Seller only has a 89% rating with only 15 sales though. So I’m not the first person they’ve screwed with. Sorry. Rant over. That item has been on my list for years now. I was excited. Now I’ve got emotional whiplash and I’m trying to avoid going to bed angry. Thank you to anyone who read this far. I hope you’re getting a better site experience than I have lately. EDIT: Whoa. This blew up a bit. So sorry I haven’t responded to you all. I’ve been on the road for work and didn’t think this would generate so much discussion. I’m grateful to everyone here, and I did manage to find a way to leave feedback eventually. Took me till 3am to figure out how, but I was motivated. And I’ll definitely be checking out seller reviews more thoroughly in the future. Thank you everyone.",

Here was my response from eBay when asked about it. I have 100% seller feedback and 44 sales for a total of around $7,400 in around 100 days. Just making sure this is true and not a line of BS. From what I have read, holds are only supposed to happen for 30 days..sometimes longer..up to 90 days. That’s why I reached out to eBay. Below is the email response from eBay: Hello Christopher, Thank you for contacting eBay Customer Service regarding holds on funds. My name is Abhishek. I understand you wish to know the reason why it is still 3 days. I am more than happy to assist you. First of all, I am really happy to know that you have been doing really good in terms of your selling performance. I can see that you are becoming truly a great seller day by day. There are numerous reasons why funds may be held temporarily. We use holds to encourage best selling practices and to ensure both the buyer and the seller have a safe and smooth transaction. Funds are placed on hold to ensure transactions are completed successfully. In some situations, this means allowing extra time after the buyer has received the item – even if they have left feedback – to review their purchase. This also means funds are available to sellers if they need to accept a return or provide a refund to the buyer. eBay must adhere to certain legal and compliance obligations, outlined in our Payments Terms of Use, which require us to place funds on hold in certain circumstances. We must also ensure eBay remains a safe marketplace for both buyers and sellers. This means we may place a hold on funds for some transactions. These 3 days time is actually a normal time line for every sellers to get their funds, there are cases where funds can be hold for longer than that. But, you have been on eBay now for 100 days there are very less chances to getting l",

I've had problems with impulse buying before however it was always real life shopping in a mall or a store and was about much smaller amounts. I think it's important to mention that I suffer with bpd and currently I'm very lonely and looking for ways to escape the reality full with boredom and loneliness which I think was the main factor to this breakout. Even though I realized the amounts I'm spending and that I'm having a serious problem and I'm trying to control it, I'm still opening the app a few times a day and scrolling looking for anything good. Whenever I see anything I want it takes me less than a minute to go to checkout. What do I do? How do I stop this? I'm not in a dangerous financial situation but at this point I feel stupid and annoyed at myself for this. Is anyone else having the same problem? How do I distract myself?",

I bought it on eBay after selling a huge Yankees card from Triple Threads Topps decided they couldn't make the card. 3 of the 10 guys on it have now passed away. It's not unreasonable, but they substituted the first card here without even an email or a question, despite multiple emails saying I did not want a substitution. A Shohei auto /199 die cut. It's dope, but it's not even close to what I wanted, despite it being worth almost the same as what I paid for the redemption originally. I called Topps and spoke with a dude named Jesse. He was floored at the names on my original redemption. He sent a message to the redemption team requesting some Cardinals stuff to make up for failing to produce the card I desired so much, but made no guarantees. Fast forward a week and a half, and I had another shipment coming from Topps. They sent me a Gilded Collection Pujols auto /10 and a sweet Goldy relic /10 from Diamond Icons, I think it's a piece of his elbow guard. Jesse, you're the man. This isn't what I originally wanted but the extra swag you convinced the redemption team to send me softens the blow quite a bit. At least I have a couple sweet PC cards to put in my display case and may end up selling the Shohei to make my money back. Topps sure as hell ain't perfect, but they made this right, and I appreciate it. Hope y'all had a great Easter and enjoy seeing these beastly cards!",

          "text": "Pricing: a guide(ish) A fair amount of the questions in this sub are about pricing, and I thought I’d put together a short guide to help newer bookkeepers navigate this aspect of things since pricing can be tricky. The most common piece of feedback I’ve seen given here by experienced bookkeepers is that you don’t have enough information from the client. It’s not enough to know the number of accounts and number of transactions. You need to know the COMPOSITION of those transactions. If a client has 300 transactions, are those 10 invoices via direct ACH deposit and 290 simple expenses via credit card that can be sorted via auto add rules? Or is it a cacophony of 147 invoices in a POS system where fees need to be entered manually or via a clearing account, 16 returns, 4 credit card credits, 34 checks that need to be verified against the bank statement, 8 transfers to PayPal, 10 owner’s draws, 2 random AR in Quickbooks because the POS wasn’t compatible with a few client payments, 6 loan payments split between principal and interest, 8 payroll transactions (4 for wages, 4 for taxes), 2 charges for little Betty’s soccer camp that should’ve been on the client’s personal card instead, 15 purchases of fixed assets (via accrual basis, needing original cost and depreciation sub accounts created for each one, each time a new asset is added to the books), and 47 simple expenses (i.e. monthly software subscription costs, utilities, etc..)? To give the right pricing, you need to ask the right questions. Does the client want to track individual invoices per customer name or are they okay with recording more general bulk sales deposits? Do they want to track by location, by project, by product line (class and location tracking). Do they want receipt tracking? How is your client currently keeping their books? Will you have to transition them into new software or are they already set up? Do they accept USD only or do they accept 14 foreign currencies? Do they sell on just Etsy? Or Ets",

          "text": "PO Box Problem Ebay International Shipping US to Canada Hi everyone, Hope you are all doing well! Tl;dr I'm a buyer who's packages were destroyed since ebay International Shipping switched to couriers that don't accept PO boxes. Is there a way to prevent this in the future with a PO box? Shipping is from US to Canada I'm a buyer in Canada who normally uses a PO box with eBay International Shipping for safer delivery. Recently 2 items were destroyed since the courier transferred from USPS to DHL/Asendia at the ebay International Shipping Centre. These 2 couriers don't accept PO boxes - normally my parcels complete the US journey with USPS before being transferred to Canada Post which accepts PO boxes. I'm surprised this happened since shipping restrictions are usually shown at checkout. Is there a way to prevent this issue in the future with a PO box address? Any help would be really appreciated. Thanks!",

          "text": "Opinions on where to set up shop online? I have a shop, website (currently under construction to speed up processes, ease of checkout and better inventory system) as well as an eBay store where I mainly sell basketball cards; but have a little of everything. I decided to open the eBay store 3 years ago to try and widen my audience to help get rid of some basic cards that were taking up too much room, but still selling all my graded cards or even raw cards worth money that had been pulled. So basically a decent balanced selection....I’ve been a Top Seller on eBay since month 3 of my store being opened. I had to upgrade my store within the first year, because I was expanding so quickly with the amount of cards, memorabilia, and sports card products. At this point, I’m still a Top Seller and everything was going smoothly as I have around 1K cards or listings active right now. February marked my first month of not being a Top Seller, but Above Average due to eBay hitting my metrics with stuff like “tracking not uploaded or updated”, “Not shipped on time”, and a refund to a customer who lives outside the US and used a reshipper to get his card via PWE and complained within the first week and then on week two opened an “item not received request”. I’ve contacted eBay about all kinds of issues and it’s just circle talk, they won’t allow you to speak with a supervisor. They just put you off on someone else in the same department and won’t answer any questions or issues as an actual human. They just circle back around again.....so I’m ready to close up shop and set up on a different platform where I can still bulk upload, and hopefully bulk edit. So, ridiculously long story short....if you were going to or have started from scratch on a platform with 1K cards or so, what platform would that be? I’m a member of a lot of platforms, some that are semi-private and the rest wide open to the public. All fine with me. But I hate eBay so much right now and have since around October-",

It is going through Ebay's authenticity guarantee verification per the normal process, my question is does anyone know what will happen? Will PSA still authenticate the slab and seal it with an authenticate sticker, will they send it back to the seller, or send it to me the buyer without the sticker saying they can't authenticate? I understand there is no way they will authenticate the signature, which is fine I don't really care. But will they authenticate the slab and card itself? If anyone knows please let me know, being the idiot I am, only thought about this after I paid, and the slab already enroute to PSA authentication. Thank you",

I sold an authentic designer handbag on eBay. The bag itself passed eBay Authentication with no issue. I did not request authentication — the transaction was automatically routed into the Authenticity Guarantee program by eBay / the buyer. Along with the bag, I shipped handmade leather replacement straps. These were: not counterfeit not branded lawful personal property packaged separately disclosed as non-original accessories After authentication, I was notified that while the bag passed, the handmade straps would be discarded and not returned to me. At no point during listing or checkout was there a clear, prominent disclosure that lawful accessories could be destroyed without compensation. There was no checkbox, warning screen, or affirmative acknowledgment explaining that this could happen. Any reference appears to be buried in fine-print terms. I understand authenticators removing non-original items from the shipment — but permanently discarding seller property without a return option (even at seller’s expense) feels like a disclosure and consent problem. I’m sharing this so other sellers know: Do not include replacement or handmade accessories with items routed to authentication Even if they’re legal and disclosed, they may be discarded You may not have opted into authentication, but you’re still bound by its terms",

          "text": "Sent a $600+ Pokemon card to eBay Authenticator in USPS Priority Small box, they sent it back in a beat up bubble mailer. Is this normal? I’m looking for some insight from anyone who has received a card from eBay’s Authenticity Guarantee. I sold a high-value raw Pokemon card ($600+) and took every precaution shipping it to the authenticator. I used a USPS Priority Mail small box, lined with foam and packing paper, with the card securely protected in a sleeve and card saver between two foam pieces. The card was rejected for \"Listing Accuracy.\" While I understand their standards are strict, I feel the need to specify that I didn't hide anything about this card. I specifically called out a small surface dimple on the back border in the description and included a dedicated close-up photo of it. When it arrived yesterday, the mailer was torn and had visible punctures. Even worse, the inspector’s notes were contradictory: they verified the card is 100% authentic, but then added a note saying \"please update your listing to reflect that the card is altered.\" I pulled this card from a pack myself and have not modified it. I'm not sure I understand why they believe it was altered. Maybe because they didn't like the small surface dimple, but I had already disclosed in the listing. It seems okay upon first look, but I'm stressed that a $600 card was treated so carelessly by the people paid to protect the transaction. A few questions for the group: 1. Is it normal for eBay to basically downgrade shipping from a box to a mailer on returns? 2. Has anyone else had a pack-fresh card labeled \"altered\" by an eBay authenticator? 3. If I find any damage upon closer inspection, what is the best way to hold eBay/the authenticator accountable since they discarded my original protective packaging? Appreciate any advice or shared experiences.",

The listing explicitly included multiple (3) strap options and an OEM stainless bracelet, which was one of the main reasons I bought this specific watch at the price I paid. The watch just went through authenticity this morning. eBay confirmed that the watch itself is authentic, but flagged a “listing accuracy issue” and stated that the additional strap and bracelet couldn’t be verified and would not be included in the shipment. They gave me the option to accept it without the additional strap and bracelet, or receive a full refund. The problem is that if I want to accept it and just buy a replacement bracelet and strap, just based on a quick search, looks like it’ll be $600-700. So by accepting it, I’m basically overpaying for just the watch head and one strap. Has anyone else had eBay authentication remove things that were clearly shown and described in the listing? Did you accept the item, return it, or get a price adjustment? This is my first time buying from eBay so I’d appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance",

I messaged the seller to tell him that didn’t look like a 58 but definitely looked like a 54. You can even see the reference in one of the pics. He wrote back and said he bought it from an eBay seller a few weeks prior and sent a picture of the listing which has a heritage reference number and says it is 39mm. This watch made it through the “Authentication” process and was delivered. There is no way they looked at this watch because at the very least the reference number in the listing was not 79000. This seller says the authentication card says BB58. Makes me question if buying from EBay is safe",

My feedback is great as a buyer but basically non-existent as a seller. The buyer is on the other side of the country so I can't deliver in person. The card is graded and slabbed, but won't go through the eBay authentication process. My thoughts-- please tell me if I should do anything different: 1) Accept the offer 2) Video of myself packing the card at Fedex, every step of the way -- including the tracking number-- and never having focus off the card. 3) Sending it for the full insured amount -- overnight (overkill?) with signature required. Is there anything else I'm not considering? I'm worried about all sorts of things. The buyer has feedback over 60 and 100% and has been an eBay member for almost 20 years.",

However on inspection, I see the warranty card does not have the watch number on it, and the reference and date are blank.

The item sold is custom jewelry. Hello, looking for some insight here. I sold an expensive item (10k+) on May 9th, 2025. Item was delivered to buyer on May 13th, 2025. I received the \"Buyer has filed a dispute with their payment institution\" on October 7th, 2025. I challenged the dispute the same day, stating it was past the return policy (14 days) and past the eBay 30 day policy, and the fact that I encouraged the buyer to open a return and I would accept if the buyer was not happy with the size, color, or for any reason. The buyer reason: \"The item doesn't match the description in your listing\" Buyer comments: \"I messaged the seller but he's not responding\" Buyer messaged once saying \"hello\" on September 29th. Account age: 19 years old 100% buyer feedback 18 items sold 100% feedback (all items 5k-10k) Item was not in ebay's authenticity guarantee program, I do have a ebay \"store\". I sold another item for $7k 2 weeks prior to the dispute, and now ebay is obviously witholding my funds for that item. Has anyone been through this for this large of an amount and this later on after delivery? Do i have any recourse with ebay other than the \"appeal\"? Can I expect eBay to protect me/ban this buyer from the platform? Basically, from what I've read on chargebacks, the scammer will most likely get to keep my 12k item, while ebay reimburses using by 7k payout, so im essentially out 20k+?",

I purchased a trading card for ~$1800. Authentication Guarantee was a part of this. At some point in the process there were some damaging depressions made in the card. These damages were very clearly not there in the seller’s photos, but were present when it was delivered to me. This is a one-of-a-kind card, so there is no possible dubious swapping going on. Ebay has suggested essentially that I relist and sell the card in an auction on the site, and that they would reimburse me for the differences in what I paid and the proceeds from the sale. They will not allow me to just return the card. Has anyone else ever experienced this? It just seems odd to me, and I question whether I can trust eBay to follow through with their side of this. How they’ve treated this so far, I don’t feel confident in their processes. EDIT: upon re-reading their recent message, they’re actually only offering to reimburse me for the fees to resell it. Which is definitely a lose-lose situation for me.",

I did. The seller, in the original listing, wrote: \"Houndoom H11/H32 Aquapolis Holo **in near perfect condition**. Kept in binder with minimal light exposure, minor curling due to age... **Card has almost no signs of wear**, only things a grader would look for. Definitely a great collector's item, looking to get rid of quickly.\" Evidently, his statements weren't true. Thankfully eBay intercepted this for me. Attached photos from communication by eBay (email/app), and eBay listing shots Just thought I'd share. Kind of feel a bit better buying a card this way, than from a less protected medium like OfferUp or Mercari.

The listing stated that the items would be shipped to an authenticator first and then sent to me if they passed authentication. However, I just received one of my packages, and it was not authenticated. There was no authenticity seal, and inside the package was a letter stating: *\"This item was miscategorized during the listing process and is not eligible for our Authenticity Guarantee service.\"* This is frustrating because the seller only sells graded cards. I don’t understand how the listing could have been miscategorized. I have two more packages coming from the same seller, and I expect the same issue to happen. Because of this, I no longer have the protection I thought I was getting. Am I overreacting, or is this a major issue? Who is responsible here eBay or the seller?",

Also if you notice the patches are identical to the ones sold at Goldin last year. Also, if you notice the black cloud behind Mahomes, it looks way different in the actual card that's graded from Beckett than in the ebay/etsy images.

Google shows 10oz bars same design but no 1oz, only thing related to this bar i can find is Walmart - and not sure if 3rd parties can post to Walmart? Seller said it's from America (I know apmex is) and is pure solid silver? Just checking if it is solid or if most likely plated as the more I look at it the 'tarnish' the seller has described looks more like copper under silver plate? Wondering if anyone can say 100% either way as will cancel order if it is plated before the seller ships saves me hassle in returning etc after XRF testing",

My ability to work requires significant accommodations. My working with local employment office and the state disability employment office is lackluster so far. Yes, I've been applying for jobs. I have an upcoming CPA appointment because I likely fudged up my 2024 taxes and need to make sure my 2025 taxes are done, so that's 400+. The refund I need because its about the only cash I will have. Public Assistance will cover my food but doesn't even cover my rent (its only about 80%) Applying for HEAP is a pain due to a roommate situation. The only thing I can start doing is selling stuff. I have put this off because its not sustainable, people want to buy something for nothing, and it counts as income for Public Assistance, so it ultimately undermines my entire Public Assistance package. I'm trying to remember what I have and what I'm willing to let go in this first round. The stuff I have, I may have spent thousands of dollars on, but for selling its worth hundreds at most. In the mean time, I started shifting things over to my credit card as I'm trying to avoid paying my CPA with a credit card as that transaction will count as a cash advance, and I have 0% APR until September. I know it's a bad decision and I already have a balance, but I gotta float myself as long as possible in hopes I can find a job myself or the organizations that I am working with can help me find a job. At the end of the day, how do you budget money to last forever? My first SSDI application was denied and I found a way to make money so I disqualified myself in the first place. Its super easy to be gainfully employed when you can charge $75 an hour. My next SSDI application isn't worth submitting until I get my doctors straighten out on this \"presumed\" or \"suspected\" stuff they are on, even though I have an official diagnosis.

On December 2nd, I bought two boxes of Magic MTG Avatar The Last Airbender JUMPSTART Booster Box from a seller listed at $84.44 and it was going to be gifted as a Christmas present. I got the confirmation e-mail that I paid and to await shipping details. After a couple days I check again and it said estimated delivery was Dec 6-12th. Well this past weekend I realized, hey it's the 14th now and I never got it, so I went to check again and it said how this item is delayed, but the estimated delivery time was the same, and it said order in process. But when I went to check the actual USPS tracking status, it had \"Shipping Label Created, USPS Awaiting Item\" as the only update. That means the seller never shipped the item, they never even took it to USPS in the first place right? So kinda very disappointed and confused at this point, I went back to eBay and on the 'Purchase History' where it says 'Leave Feedback' and all that, there was an option that said \"Item never received\" So I clicked that and it made me fill out a short questionnaire on the issue, and I had marked the option \"I still want this item\" and left a one sentence on how it seems like the item was never shipped. And from here the seller has 3 days to respond to this issue or eBay makes them refund me. Well this morning, meaning not even a day has passed, I get an e-mail from eBay that my refund is being issued. I didn't request for a refund, I wanted those Magic cards still. The seller is one state away from where I live so it shouldn't take long to ship them out, I was hoping to still get these to give as a Christmas gift. I go back to that seller's page to the same Magic cards listing, and now the boxes are being sold for $94.88. Now I'm mad. I had bought those Magic cards at a time where the price was still decent, knowing if I waited longer there's a chance the price would go up. But I'm gues",

This has led to wave after wave of scams, misleading auctions, and shady practices. 2. Fakes Everywhere Counterfeit Pokémon cards are flooding the platform. Without authentication or seller screening, buyers have no way to know if the cards are real until they show up in the mail. 3. Missing or Incorrect Orders A major complaint across the platform: People pay... and never receive their cards. Or they receive cards they didn’t bid on. Or their “hits” magically never arrive. 4. No Real Buyer Protection Whatnot’s refund system is extremely weak compared to eBay, TCGplayer, or PayPal. If something goes wrong, you’re basically relying on: • Email support • AI-generated responses • Hope Not a great mix. 5. No Real Customer Service Support is slow, template-based, and often doesn’t read the actual issue. Buyers frequently feel ignored or brushed off. 6. No Way to Verify Authenticity on Stream You can’t inspect cards in-hand. You can’t verify: • Texture • Holo pattern • Weight • Edges • Print quality Streamers control the camera and the environment not you. 7. Inflated Prices + Hype Manipulation Many sellers use: • Bots • Shill bidders • FOMO tactics • “Heat piles” • Fake reactions to drive prices up. People regularly overpay compared to eBay sold listings. 8. Loaded Packs, Searched Packs, & Repacks Because sellers aren’t monitored, many streamers: • Weigh packs • Re-seal packs • Create custom “mystery” sets with junk cards • Replace hits And buyers have no way to tell. 9. No Accountability If a seller scams you today, they can: • Make a new account tomorrow • Rebrand • Hop to a different category and keep selling. 10. Better, Safer Alternatives Exist eBay (with seller ratings + buyer protection) TCGplayer Local card shops Instagram/Discord sellers with proven feedback Whatnot is the least protected ",

          "text": "Never sell luxury items on eBay I’ve been selling on eBay for years, and for the most part, my experience has been fine. I’ve sold tons of low-priced items with little to no issue. But recently, when trying to sell a few luxury pieces, I had this feeling eBay never protect their sellers. I sold a Louis Vuitton bucket hat ealier this year. Without any communication at all, the buyer directly filed a dispute through their bank, not even through eBay, not even talked to me. There was no message, no reason, no return, just a chargeback. eBay said they would “fight for my rights as a seller, and talked to the bank” but after 3 months of waiting, 3 MONTH! I lost both the money and the item. No explanation, no follow-up, nothing. There’s absolutely no real seller protection when the buyer goes through their bank instead of eBay. The second time, I sold a Balenciaga hat (with the original receipt from the store). The buyer insisted it was fake because it didn’t look identical to another Balenciaga product he owned, which is absurd, since even within the same brand, manufacturing differences are normal. I accepted the return request just to resolve it peacefully. But then the buyer left me a huge negative review, all caps shouting “FAKE” in his review, extremely rude and completely baseless. EBay refused to remove this feedback, even though I had proof of authenticity and accepted the return. And of course, sellers aren’t allowed to leave any kind of negative review for buyers, so we just have to take it. I’ve learned my lesson. EBay is not a safe place to sell luxury items. There’s zero protection for sellers dealing with high-value goods. Buyers can make false claims, file chargebacks, and eBay will just shrug and say “we tried.” If you ever plan to sell anything designer or pricey, don’t use eBay. It’s not worth the stress or the loss.",

Even though I’ve been a loyal eBay member for 13+ years, I was left completely unprotected until PayPal finally stepped in. In August purchased a necklace on **eBay Germany** listed in the *Fine Jewellery (Echtschmuck)* category as **750 (18k) gold**. The chain itself was hallmarked “750,” which by law means 18 karat. However, when I received it, I did the responsible thing: I had it **professionally tested** by a jeweller — and it turned out to be *fake*. Not 18k, not even close. A counterfeit with an illegal hallmark. * In **Germany (Feingehaltsgesetz)** and the EU, falsely hallmarked gold is **illegal**. * eBay’s own Jewellery Policy states: “Gold, silver, and platinum items must meet applicable laws for stamping.” When I reported the issue and filed a case, eBay: 1. **Initially told me** I was protected under their *Money Back Guarantee*, and that the seller had to provide a return label. 2. The seller ignored all messages and never sent a label. 3. eBay’s own staff confirmed several times that I would be refunded once the seller failed to act. But then came the absurd twist: eBay closed the case in the *seller’s favour* because I had **tested the item**. Mind you I had the piece tested at a local jewellery store using XRF, a non-destructive method. In other words: * If I **don’t test** it, I can’t prove it’s fake. * If I **do test** it (responsibly and legally), using non-destructive method, I “void” my protection. A complete *Catch-22*. After denying my refund, eBay quietly **removed the seller’s account** — “no longer a registered member.” Usually sellers who want to close their account must wait at the minimum 6 months from their last transaction. Therefore, the fact that this seller being de-platformed",

I know it’s real because my mom bought these cards back in 1999 and we’ve had them ever since. The buyer messaged me saying he peeled the top layer off and that meant it was fake, but then left negative feedback saying the card “showed up peeling.” His own words don’t even match what he posted. He also told me if I just refunded his money he wouldn’t leave negative feedback. When I told him I wouldn’t refund until the card was returned since he admitted to damaging it, he left the negative review anyway and still hasn’t sent the card back. After I pushed back, he sent another message saying he tried peeling an old Poliwag from the 90s and “couldn’t peel it with pliers” so that proves mine is fake. I’ve reported him to eBay for feedback extortion but I haven’t heard back yet. My questions: has anyone else dealt with a buyer peeling apart a WOTC holo and then claiming it’s counterfeit? Do authentic holos peel like this if someone forces it? Ive attached photos from my eBay listing, the pics he sent along with the messages.",

I shipped out maybe a month ago $250 worth of Pokemon cards to a buyer (who has very high ratings, trusted buyer) and they reached out about not receiving their package. So I did everything I could in my power to contact USPS and also contact EBAY. We all know how impossible both of these can be to work with as EBay is unresponsive and won’t even let you talk to them and USPS’ website is ancient doesn’t work half the time and I don’t think they will help me if the package officially says ‘delivered’ in their system. So even with insurance on the package, I don’t think I can get my money back from USPS. If I’m wrong about that point me in the right direction. I told the buyer to mark the item as ‘not received’ because EBay would not let me contact them or make any changes until a case was made. Which gave me 3 days to update tracking/talk to my buyer, which I did. The tracking on USPS’ official site says delivered and shows all of the tracking updates. eBay did not show all the tracking updates and just says ‘out to delivery to authenticator’. I don’t even know what an authenticator is or is needed for considering the cards are graded, and I’ve sold a 1k card and did not have this stupid process go on. Me and my buyer are extremely confused and feel like eBay just snapped up our extremely expensive purchase and is preventing us from working with them. I don’t know if somehow USPS is wrong when I feel their tracking is usually reliable, so I’m favored to believe EBay is messing something up on their end. They emailed me today that they sided with the buyer (clearly didn’t read anything about our case) and issued a full refund. Now I’m screwed out of my childhood cards and the cash I really needed. What the hell do I do. Update 1: Now I’ve received an over $40 charge to my bank account because that’s how much eBay decided to overcharge my b",

          "text": "Sealed Collecting: Is it dead? This is my personal story of the last 5 years of sealed collecting, investing, and selling. Part 1: Going in hard, and getting in way way to deep. 5 years ago it was the summer of 2020 and I was on vacation sitting in a pool somewhere in Georgia and youtube fed me a video. I had returned to MTG in 2018 with Dominaria and I was still in full excitement mode seeing some of my old cards from the 90s had appreciated in value. The supply chain FOMO of 2020 and 2021 was just setting in when a video on Youtube got me psyched about building a cardboard empire. The guy was wearing a green visor, standing in front of a wipe board and talking about box prices going to the moon. I had done pretty well in the 90s buying sealed boxes of ice age, alliances and mirage cracking packs and selling singles to pay for the hobby. It seemed like sealed was the way to go. My optimistic and incredibly naïve plan: Buy a case of each set, wait the 5 years for it to double, sell half the case and have a free sealed collection. My goal was to spend about $2K per year on draft plus some extraneous stuff like commander decks and bundles, then after 5 years have about $10,000 invested worth $20,000. At the 2x mark I wanted to start selling to achieve a $10,000 set of sealed products for free. 5 years later did it work? Well sort of... Here are some things that have changed: · Specialty sets that cost 2x-3.5x a normal set (I’m looking at you commander masters) · Regular sets skyrocketing in price 50% from $80 to $130 a box · The pace of sets – No more 3x 1 case per year. · The amount of different product lines – collector, set, draft, play, commander decks etc · Universes beyond Needless to say, the idea of just spreading a little bit of money out and waiting became almost infinitely harder. MTG added set and collector boosters? Unsure of which to buy, I bought a case of each. Double masters came out and VIP boxes were $80-90, with draft at $300. I bought some cases o",

Both collections have sat in binders in the corner of my room untouched for a month or so. 2 nights ago I decided to admire my prime collection that I worked hard going through eBay auctions and going to multiple card shops trying to collect every card. Upon opening the binder I noticed the center piece (Meganium Prime) was missing . I panicked wondering if it fell or if it slid behind one of my other cards but it was gone . Decided to look through my other binders I had stacked and of course my ceruledge IR , tapu bulu IR and eevee IR promo we're missing aswell. Checked my wifes binder to see if she had cards missing and of course some of her Raikous that she's been collecting have been taken specifically her amazing rare raikou that started her collection. We were heart broken but then it dawned on us that my 11 year old nephew has been secretly coming down stairs in our living space when we leave to go to work . We caught him once cause he thought we weren't home but my wife was there . After telling his mother the situation what exactly was missing and how much the cards were worth she told me he had admitted to them being taken and that he had a handful of cards at school in his desk that belonged to me. I wish the story ended with him returning from school with all the cards he had stolen from us but unfortunately my sister returned home with a stack of cards found in their desk and not a single one of them belonged to me just a bunch of common and uncommon cards worth about 2 dollars. It hurts to know that these cards I spent my money , pulled with friends and had watched on auctions for days be traded away gone forever. I know I can always get them back but I'm so hurt that it even happened in the first place and just wanted to share what is happening and how I'm feeling with ",

I have almost 500’sold with a 100% rating. I’m definitely not trying to do a swap a roo on my customers. So they have started a return for wrong item received. I’m guessing I have to accept the return and then when he sends back the “wrong card” I have to appeal to eBay and play the gamble of will they side with me and this obvious scam?

While many guides exist, most are either outdated or primarily focused on the American postal system. So, I wanted to share my process from start to finish—whether you're creating your own system or just looking for new ideas to improve your selling experience! This is a comprehensive guide, and I’ll admit I can be a bit scatterbrained. If anything is unclear or needs further clarification, feel free to ask! Any links I provide are for the tools I personally use—they’re not necessarily the best, and you can likely swap them out for alternatives that suit you. For context on my credibility as a seller, here’s my eBay feedback rating: Since October 2023, I’ve sold **714 items**. Out of those, I’ve had **one item damaged** and **two returned to sender** (due to a vacant address, but both were successfully resent without issue). I’ve never had a case of an item not being delivered. https://preview.redd.it/dz41wwmg5sne1.png?width=939&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6bfa943ce9f885a5a474c2712c96dbce2af55fb \\_\\_\\_ # Scanning/Photographing **What you’ll need:** * [Scanner](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/details/hp-envy-5530-e-all-in-one-printer-series/model/5304882) AND/OR [Light Box](https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Professional-Dimmable-Backdrops-Photography/dp/B08PDP3YSP?th=1) * [Scanning Software with Auto Crop/Separate function](https://scanspeeder.com/) (Depending on your scanner, it may come with software that does this already, if it does it usually sucks, but try it. I like and use ScanSpeeder Pro, there’s a trial version that’s pretty limited otherwise you’ll have to buy/obtain the Pro version) Time is money at this stage. You want clear pictures, but when you have a large number of cards to pro",

          "text": "Low selling limits and how to raise them. TLDR: eBay limited me to 10 items/$500 a month. what requirements do I need to meet to get them to bump it up? I previously sold on eBay last year and had a pretty high limit of items I could sell. I wound up sick and my store had a sale I didn't fulfill while dealing with that. Gave the buyer a refund, they left a neutral feedback (my only \"bad\" feedback I've ever received) and that was that. I turned my store off because I didn't have time to run it properly. Fast forward to early this year I decided to start selling again and eBay has limited me to 10 items or a max of $500 a month because of unfulfilled orders. I only have the one unfulfilled order mentioned above. Since starting again I've sold 8 items all with positive feedback and all items were shipped earlier than the expected timeframe however, eBay refuses to bump my limit up and also refuses to tell me the requirements I need to meet to get my limit higher. I'm finding it awfully hard to make a decent amount of sales with a limit of 10 items at a time. I also can't imagine it's going to be easy to make a decent amount of sales if they expect a lot of quick turnarounds. Anyone know what requirements they want me to meet in order to get this bumped back up? I have a huge backlog of stock I want to get out and it's becoming annoying. TIA!",

          "text": "Most Expensive Graded Fusion World Cards (Feb 2026) The latest iteration in my “Most Expensive Fusion World” series: here are the *most expensive GRADED Fusion World cards as of February 2026*. I’ve done away with categorizing cards by set number as that only invite confusion and trolls, so the above represents the totality of Fusion World, including all booster boxes, Energy Markers and both Manga Booster Sets. \\*Please be mindful of the existence of reprint cards appearing in subsequent sets. As always, it's important to DYOR in this regard\\* Set and card number are indicated, as well as grade received (and from which grading company). Under the cards you’ll find the price the card was sold at, which does not include tax or shipping, as well as the sales date. All sales are from eBay. I also note whether the sale was sold at auction, at the listed price, or if a best offer was accepted. In the interest of keeping variety, I’ve included no duplicate cards in the list, (otherwise the list would just be a bunch of FP-001 sold listings ranked by sale price, which might be a separate and interesting future assignment). The only exceptions to this are FB01-139 and FB06-120, which both appear once as a BGS 10 Black Label and then once as a non-black label PSA/BGS 10. I found this to be a good illustration of the difference between a black label and a regular 10 for the same graded card. As always this is for informational purposes only. If it’s not useful or interesting to you, feel free to move on. **I’ve decided I may just start blocking folks who want to constantly rehash the “people like you are ruining the hobby” argument, when all I’m doing is reporting objective price data. That way they won’t ever see my hard work again which they claim is useless information to them in the first place.** But to the rest of you, enjoy, and happy to discuss anything shown here. \\*EDIT\\*: Of note, a PSA 10 [FB04-012](https://www.ebay.com/itm/137026190652?nordt=true) sold yesterday ",

Between the eBay \"**Whale**\" thesis and the \"**Trio**\" roll-up (PSA/Funko/Newegg), RC is building a conglomerate. The **Oct ’26 Warrants (GME/WS)** are the surgical tool for high-leverage ROI, protected by a Board-controlled \"Extension Joker.\" # 1. The Financial Fortress: $9 Billion and a Bitcoin Floor As of late January 2026, GameStop’s balance sheet is an anomaly in the retail world. **\\[1\\]** * **The War Chest**: With \\~$9B in cash and liquid securities, GME is no longer defensive. It is a predator. This cash generates hundreds of millions in interest alone, ensuring consistent profitability even before a single game is sold. * **The Bitcoin Factor**: In 2025, GameStop moved to diversify its treasury into Bitcoin (averaging \\~$107k/BTC for 4,710 coins). **\\[2\\]** While BTC has seen recent volatility (consolidating around $79k), it provides a \"Hard NAV\" (Net Asset Value) floor. Crucially, GME recently moved its holdings to **Coinbase Prime \\[3\\]**, signaling they are preparing for maximum liquidity—likely to fund a massive, immediate cash acquisition. # 2. The $100 Billion Incentive: A Tranche-Based Roadmap On January 7, 2026, Ryan Cohen signed a performance-based stock option award that is 100% \"at-risk.\" This isn't a \"mandate\" to hit $100B overnight, but a highly structured reward system for long-term growth. \\[4\\] * The Tranche System: The award is broken down into nine distinct milestones. The first tranche only vests when GME hits a $20 Billion Market Cap and $2 Billion in cumulative EBITDA. Subsequent tranches vest in $10B increments until the $100B goal is reached. * The \"Buy-In\": This isn't a gift of shares. If RC performs, he earns the right to buy sha",

I bought this card on eBay at an auction for 330 USD; but shipping, taxes and import fees bring up the total to about 425 USD. The problem is that the card arrived with an ident mark on the lower border that wasn't on the listing pictures or description. Seller claims it wasn't there when shipped but is offering a 50 USD refund. I don't grade usually, but in my opinion the proposed refund seems low for such a significant mark. What's the highest PSA grade a card like this can get and would you take the deal? If not, what would you say is a more appropriate refund for it? Thanks in advance for your help!",

Just because a Pokemon is ultra popular doesn't mean you can flood the market with graded copies of its card and make bank. Especially Japanese (and ultra modern Japanese at that). Even if their copies continue to sell at $700 to $800 (last auction sales), the grading fees and market fees mean they are likely losing money on every sale, not to mention any 8's or 9's they get. Not bashing this person by any means, but wow, never do this for any card, let alone a Japanese one.

But since a lot of people keep posting and asking, this'll break down what else you can try. **Why cant I find cards:** \\-2025 Popularity Surge and Price Bubble - Starting late 2024 Pokemon card popularity began to once again surge, with the surge came scarcity as product was unable to be fulfilled to meet demand. This unprecedented demand was met with surging prices as well beginning a ridiculous value increase spiral that has caught the eyes of not just the general public but also big money investors. The more money that gets focused into the hobby, the more people start to hear about it, and unfortunately the more people try finding opportunity to make money from others in the hobby. \\-Scalpers - These are the people who follow around card vendors, buy everything they can so that others cant get it, then flip it for 2x or 3x price. If you are dedicated and thorough you can make some serious money doing this BUT IT IS HIGHLY RISKY. One bad buy could tie up thousands and waste your time trying to sell. \\-Cardshops - In response to the popularity and scalpers, many shops have taken to raising prices themselves to take in as much profit while the market is hot. Some may be scalpers themselves hitting up stores to stock their own store, or they can be in cahoots with scalpers buying at just under market price to resell above market price since its still tough to find cards. Its a two way street that never benefits the general buyer. \\-Grading - You pay a company (hopefully reputable) to assess the condition of your card. This is usually done for 2 of the many reasons, protection or resale. Since factories are pumping cards out in a mad rush, quality control is terrible. If a card is assessed at Gem Mint condition (usually listed as a 10) then it is likely in the top percentage of condition for that card, this gives it a massive p",

          "text": "Grading opinion for a noob card owner Hi gang, looking for some advice on whether to get these cards graded. I inherited them from my dad and I did as much research as I could on 130point, PSA, and eBay but the comps range wildly. Basically looking for whether it’s worth it to get all, some, or none of these cards graded. I am a huge noob so please bear with me, notes listed below: - the Tony Gonzalez Topps Chrome card has an orange border, does that make it more valuable? - the Joe Namath card is in pretty awful condition. Is it even worth selling raw? - I think the Frank Thomas card and 5 other cards from the 1989 NFL Topps set are worth grading since they’re in pretty great condition - same logic as above for Kevin McHale and Julius Erving, they’re in pretty good condition - the remaining 6 basketball cards on the bottom row are pretty beat up. Prob can’t be graded but are they even worth selling raw? Thank you",

          "text": "I’ve been in the hobby for a while and mostly buy singles, but I wanted to try Fanatics Collect’s Instant Rip just to see how everything works. Dropped $250 on a basketball pack just out of curiosity. I actually pulled a legit grail: a 2014 LeBron James patch card. Their system immediately showed a “value” around $1,400, which made no sense at all. Realistic value is maybe $500 to $600. So I skipped their whole end-of-process valuation and took the $1,200 instant credit. That part was easy. Everything after that... not great. The user interface feels like it was designed by someone who doesn’t collect. It’s clunky, the layout is strange, and finding basic info takes more taps than it should. Their weekly auction structure also feels odd. Maybe there’s a reason for it, but from the outside it just seems limiting. Their Card Ladder pricing is rough. They’re pulling comps from 2022, so you basically have to bounce between eBay and their app to figure out real values. It slows everything down and makes it hard to trust what you’re looking at. I used my $1,200 credit toward an overpriced 1980 Topps Bird–Magic–Dr. J rookie PSA 7 listed at $1,600. I paid the extra $400 cash to cover the difference and added it to my collection. Cool. Then I tried to withdraw it. They hit me with a $75 fee. $48 to “withdraw” the card, with no explanation or breakdown. $25 shipping. Plus tax. Paying $75 just to get a card in hand is wild. It makes the whole thing feel like a cash grab built on keeping you inside their ecosystem and charging you every time you try to leave it. At this point I’m deleting the app and won’t be using it again. That’s just my experience, but it was enough for me.",

Need PSA/Card Grading Tips! 🕵️♂️ I was incredibly lucky and managed to acquire 59 copies of the Coffee Break Detective Pikachu promo card. They are all in pristine condition—they've only been handled twice: once to open and once to immediately put them into storage. I've done some research and see a PSA 10 copy can sell for around the $400 range, which has me excited! I believe a large majority of my copies would grade highly, but I'm completely new to the process and need some guidance before I send them in. ❓ My Grading and Shipping Questions PSA Service Levels: I looked at the PSA website and saw different prices for submission. What is the actual difference in service for a higher price? Is it just the turnaround time (how fast they grade them) and the Max Declared Value for insurance/upcharge purposes? I'm only looking to get the cards graded, so I'm not sure which price tier to choose. Trial Submission: I'm planning on submitting a small batch (2 or 3 cards) first to get a feel for the process and see what grades I get back before sending in the rest. Does this sound like a good strategy? Grading Company (PSA vs. Others): Is PSA still the undisputed \"go-to\" and best value-maximizer for modern Pokémon cards? Are there other companies like CGC or BGS that the community prefers, and why? Shipping/Protection (Immediate Concern): This is my most urgent question! I currently do not have penny sleeves or card savers/toploaders. For a temporary solution until I can buy proper supplies, I'm currently using a makeshift method: Placing each card inside the smallest sandwich bag I have. Sandwiching the bagged card between two 5x5-inch pieces of cut-out cardboard. Securing the cardboard with rubber bands in a cross-pattern. Is this an acceptable temporary storage/shipping method to prevent damage while I wait for proper supplies to arrive? I'm worried the rubber bands might be too tight. 💰 Post-Grading: Wh",

A Charizard presented as a 'previously cracked PSA 10', with no PSA 10 label or PSA certification number in the listing. Also, why would anyone of right sound mind decide to crack open a Gem Mint PSA 10 card to sell? Looking at the back of the card a white mark is clearly visible on the bottom corner as well. Be careful out there guys, obviously I reported to eBay but their report system is busted and I wouldn't be surprised if the listing remains live for any unsuspecting victims to pay well above top £ for a raw card. Edit (a day later) - unsurprisingly the listing of the stolen cert item remains live on eBay, the report system is terrible. The seller reduced the price to £620 starting and £860 buy it now for a raw card, still a complete ripoff and well above raw value so don't do it. As of typing, when searching for a PSA 10 Charizard Ex 199/162, this listing appears second on the list. Also I was able to find and buy a legitimate PSA 10 for £885 today so happy days :D",

          "text": "Bought a Fake Card Through eBay’s Authentication Guarantee – eBay Refusing to Help Hi all, I recently purchased a Pokemon card on eBay that was covered under their Authentication Guarantee program. The card was authenticated by PSA and arrived sealed in the tamper proof packaging. However, upon inspection, it's clear that the card is a fake, (Static holo pattern, holo matches with TCGPlayer, 1st Edition stamp is not lined up properly) despite PSA marking it as authentic. I did not do my due diligence prior to purchasing due to it being through the Authentication Guarantee, now I wish I should have. I contacted eBay immediately. They redirected me to another department and unfortunately, they refused to offer a return or refund. Their reasoning was that they trust PSA’s authentication process and won’t override it, even in the case of a clear mistake. Here’s where I currently stand: * I’ve contacted PSA directly and am awaiting their response as they review the case. * The card remains sealed in its tamper proof packaging - I haven’t opened it to ensure the chain of custody is intact. * I'm considering a chargeback as a last resort, but I'd prefer to explore all possible avenues before going down that road. It’s frustrating that eBay’s authentication program which is supposed to protect buyers seems to leave no room for recourse when the authenticator gets it wrong. And ironically, PSA’s involvement has limited my ability to open a standard claim under eBay’s Money Back Guarantee. Any advice on next steps, other contacts, or how to escalate this situation?

It's an AI-powered collection manager for card collectors. **The Problem:** I collect sports cards and Pokemon cards. Managing everything in spreadsheets was a nightmare - manually typing card names, looking up prices, trying to track portfolio value. **The Solution:** SlabTrack uses AI to scan ANY card (graded or raw) and automatically: - Identifies the card (95% accurate) - Pulls live eBay pricing - Organizes your collection - Tracks portfolio analytics **Works for:** - Graded slabs (PSA, BGS, CGC) - Raw cards - Sports cards (all major sports) - Pokemon cards **Free tier:** 7 scans/month, no credit card required **Paid plans:** Start at $4.99/mo Link: slabtrack.io Would love to hear feedback from fellow builders!",

          "text": "Alright TAG gang- Couple of friends suggested I should post this data here as it would benefit everyone dealing with the wild west rodeo of TAG comps. I see a LOT of heated discussion related to how TAG should be comped- Eventually I got tired of the debate and decided to kill 3-4 hours to know for sure. **I understand that a lot of TAG sellers / vendors abide by a PSA 85-95% rule** \\- however more often than not, *to those that aren't TAG collectors, its not something known, or believed.* ***Can the data back that rule up?*** # Problem Outline: * *Lack of historical data (Normative Authority) on Ebay Last Solds causes friction between buyers, vendors, and graders at Card Shows, Ebay, Facebook Marketplace, etc.* * Variation in price or outright exclusion of TAG in PriceCharting, Collectr, CardLadder, and other aggregators causes uncertainty and inability to reach comp agreements. **I want to start this series with Charizard EX #199, because:** * Extremely Popular Modern / Charizard -> It has an abundance of Sold Data * High Value <$1000 -> Big Liquidity # Data Controls: 1. TAG & PSA data was pulled using Ebay Research Seller Tool (public) from \\[7/14/25\\] to \\[10/13/25\\]. 2. Pulled data ONLY for \\[TAG10's\\] & \\[PSA10's\\]. 3. Filtered OUT RAW, BGS, CGC, (and other weird combo deals), etc. **Please NOTE the limitations for Data Analysis:** * **Data is unable to contextualize seller TAT (Turnaround Time)** * Ebay marketplace does not encompass all market activity, and the 13-15% seller fee is considerable drag for people wanting to list to Ebay. * Consider that a LARGE proportion of TAG sales happen offline at Card Shows, FB Marketplace, etc, but IRL markets calibrate to last solds. (I know this is normal, but it's actually insane to think about.) # Major Key Insights (aka TLDR): * **TAG 10 Slabs fetch an average 89% to their PSA 10 counterpart.** * **(Pre-Mania) -** *observing prices pre-pump $1k, the relative TAG to PSA comp range was narrow (82%-98%):* * Normal Thou",

Apologies if this is the wrong place to ask this, but I recently bought a PSA graded card from a vendor and it came with this caseforceco protective [case ](https://www.caseforceco.com/products/cf-snap-guard-protective-case-for-psa-cgc-graded-cards?srsltid=AfmBOoqQiwj9LnKGch6pq9gvb1MKbl9oZf8MisjFdlvAD0dxHHTyDKDc)on it. The vendor didn't know much about the case, but after many hours of research I finally found it was this one. Problem is I have NO IDEA how to remove this thing. It's on there real good, and feels like it's built like a tank. I've tried prying with a flat head and at the point of just breaking bits and pieces of it off but would rather not do that. I have found absolutely no other info about this thing online. I asked a question on the website and messaged caseforceco on ebay directly but no response. Thanks in advance! Edit: Finally got it out! Will leave this here in case it helps anyone in the future but i used a thin flathead screwdriver starting from the middle and you basically have to slide it under to release to release the 4 clips which are the triangle shaped pieces. Those are what are holding this card. Man this case is awful do no recommend buying one",

Context: I'm interested in a TAG10 Beedrill V alt art. I've contacted the seller and sent a £120 / $160 offer across. Their response was a counter offer for $200. I asked where the price point is coming from, as last solds on Ebay are between £110-£120 / $150-$160. He said he uses Collectr app for pricing. So i went on Collectr app, and its valuing the TAG10 on there at £90 / $120. So, i asked where the $200 counter offer price point is coming from. The above was their response. For reference, its valuing the PSA10 at $175. Am I missing something or is this insane?",

Searching sold listings will give you accurate comp prices that people are actually paying. **1/1 cards** For 1/1s you need to research card sales from the same player. Look for other 1/1 cards with similar traits like brand, year, league, patch/auto etc Then set a relative price yourself. \\----- Bookmark some of these helpful guides: **Determine the value of your trading cards** [https://sundocards.com/resources/determine-the-value-of-your-trading-cards/](https://sundocards.com/resources/determine-the-value-of-your-trading-cards/) **How to value your trading cards** [https://sundocards.com/how-to-value-your-trading-cards-a-beginners-step-by-step-guide/](https://sundocards.com/how-to-value-your-trading-cards-a-beginners-step-by-step-guide/) **Should I hold or sell?** [https://sundocards.com/resources/trading-cards-should-i-hold-or-sell/](https://sundocards.com/resources/trading-cards-should-i-hold-or-sell/) **Should I get this card graded?** [https://sundocards.com/resources/should-i-get-this-trading-card-graded/](https://sundocards.com/resources/should-i-get-this-trading-card-graded/) **Guide to PSA grading** [https://sundocards.com/resources/guide-to-psa-card-grading/](https://sundocards.com/resources/guide-to-psa-card-grading/) **Guide to refractors, parallels and foils** [https://sundocards.com/resources/the-complete-guide-to-types-of-parallels-refractors-and-holographic-hologram-trading-cards/](h",

Searching sold listings will give you accurate comp prices that people are actually paying. **1/1 cards** For 1/1s you need to research card sales from the same player. Look for other 1/1 cards with similar traits like brand, year, league, patch/auto etc. Then set a relative price yourself. \\---- Bookmark some of these helpful guides: **Determine the value of your trading cards** [https://sundocards.com/resources/determine-the-value-of-your-trading-cards/](https://sundocards.com/resources/determine-the-value-of-your-trading-cards/) **How to value your trading cards** [https://sundocards.com/how-to-value-your-trading-cards-a-beginners-step-by-step-guide/](https://sundocards.com/how-to-value-your-trading-cards-a-beginners-step-by-step-guide/) **Should I hold or sell?** [https://sundocards.com/resources/trading-cards-should-i-hold-or-sell/](https://sundocards.com/resources/trading-cards-should-i-hold-or-sell/) **Should I get this card graded?** [https://sundocards.com/resources/should-i-get-this-trading-card-graded/](https://sundocards.com/resources/should-i-get-this-trading-card-graded/) **Guide to PSA grading** [https://sundocards.com/resources/guide-to-psa-card-grading/](https://sundocards.com/resources/guide-to-psa-card-grading/) **Guide to refractors, parallels and foils** [https://sundocards.com/resources/the-complete-guide-to-types-of-parallels-refractors-and-holographic-hologram-trading-cards/](https://sundocards.com/resources/the-complete-guide-to-types-of-p",

My account is in time-out now bcause f\\*ck eBay and their Buyer Protection for people that can't read a complete item description. Anyway, this has to do with me being a buyer. Was helping a family friend (senior citizen) with their older digital camera. Researched and the camera only took up to a 512MB card. I didn't have any cards that old but I found an eBay seller that did. Bought the card, and when it was it was delivered (I wasn't home but my wife was) USPS knocked on our door and had her write a check for the balance on shipping. So I get home, and I message the seller. He tells me he used eBay shipping (yes) and I confirmed the label on the box. Asked him why I had to cover part of the shipping when I thought it was all paid up front, and he had no clue. Took the box, contents and all, to my local USPS and as soon as I got to the counter the clerk says Clerk: eBay? Me: Yeah, eBay. I got charged extra and I... Clerk: That's our box. We recognize those anywhere. Me: Looks at box, and the seller had cut a USPS box open and turned it inside-out and taped it together. \"Ok, I see that.\" Clerk: That's a flat rate box. eBay postage didn't cover the whole rate, so you had to pay the balance. So I opened a case with eBay to recover the extra postage because it's not cool to surprise a customer with an extra charge. USPS had written a note on the box label about extra postage being needed, so I uploaded a pic to eBay but also made it very clear I just wanted a partial refund to cover the extra postage. Seller got the notice and messaged me asking me to close the case and said they weren't in the wrong. I message him back explaining that I shouldn't have to bear the cost of surprise postage, and that he should be upfront and honest with shipping and also shouldn't try to take advantage of \"free\" USPS boxes. He didn't agree of course. After some back and forth with eBay and making it very clear I wa",

          "text": "How I pre-grade my cards before submitting. A guideline to getting 9s and 10s more frequently. So there was a request to go into more detail about pre-grading so I thought I would follow up with what I personally do. Im sure there are plenty of other ways people do it. This is my method. First thing is I will create 2 piles of cards that are contenders. I do a brief scan, look for obvious whitening and off centering. 1 pile is cards I think are strong 10s, while the other pile is 9's + I start with centering first and foremost. Its the most obvious to see so I will scan the cards, and the front of the card is more strict than the back, so I look for pretty much 45/55 centering on cards, and if you arent sure, take some time to look through PSA 10 sold listings on ebay. PSA does make occasional mistakes but it will give you an idea for what good centering looks like. The second thing I will do is look at the back, centering on the back is more lenient but the main thing im looking for is whitening. You can still get a PSA 10 with 2 whitening spots if they arent too bad, 1 is still a 10, and none is even better. Than the next thing I look for on both sides of the cards is any dents, dings, any type of damage what so ever. It will automatically drop your card to a 5-7 even if its a tiny ding you can barely notice. It has a HUGE impact on the grade. The next thing I look at is edges, sometimes the cards have bad edges and its hard to tell but when you compare it to other cards you start to notice that some are clearly worse than others. Its hard to tell sometimes since its so thin, but sometimes it seems like entire cards have these micro dents along the edges and it destroys the gradability and is pretty hard to notice. The last thing I look for and I look real close at multiple angles is any surface issues and scratches on the card. Print lines still happen, scratches still happen. Lately ive noticed random scratches on the backs of the cards more than usual. I suspec",

          "text": "A brief outline of grading pokemon cards. When,what, and why to grade. I see a lot of questions being asked about card grading and a lot of bad information and misconceptions. I will spare you guys a whole book and keep it as concise as possible. In the hobby no matter what shop you go to, what card show, what message board you stumble upon, or which youtuber you watch, it seems like having graded cards is essential to participating in the hobby. While grading is quite popular in pokemon due to the hobby being 90% collectors and investors, in other card games that are built more of players, grading is virtually non existent with the exception of a few cases like vintage magic and numbered cards. Pokemon is completely fueled by hype, and has always been since the day the cards came out. We all had Beckett collector and pojo magazines to research the prices of our cards, and since day one its been a very collectible and value driven card game. Grading got popular during the logan paul boom from the poketubers of the time showing how it was a very profitable money making method and it was as simple as buying a raw card from a shop, grading it, and making profit. Obviously as the popularity grew with logan paul and the insane values of the cards like the 20k bulbasaur(/s) everyone decided to start grading cards, which led to the infamous 1 year + bulk turnaround time on PSA. In this day and age in the hobby grading is so well known and so essential that PSA 9's in a very large amount of cases are worth about the same as the raw cards. The price disparity shrunk rapidly as more and more people starting grading for profit to the point where it is right now which is either psa 10 or bust. Now the main reason to grade a card is to 1, authenticate, and 2 maximize the price discovery. Authenticating real cards is important for obvious reasons. Take a 1/1 card like the one ring in magic for example, even if its grades a psa 5, its important to know its authentic and its offici",

I am a long-time collector of this hobby that recently came back after taking a break when the Sun and Moon era ended, and I despise this hobby. First, I can't even get new product because people keep buying it out and it is so frustrating, because I do NOT want to support scalpers on eBay. I hate prismatic evolutions with every fiber of my being, and I think that this is one of the most overhyped and \"FOMO\" sets in the history of this hobby. I can't go to one card show without these new-gen modern only vendors that started last month shoving eeveelution cards down my throat. No, I DO NOT want to buy your color dog for 2 grand, and I'm sorry I won't sell my cards at 40% because you've \"never heard of a rainbow rare\" and \"it's not expensive enough.\" I want to make up for lost time so badly, but I cannot fathom how people justify that a CARD THAT IS STILL IN PRINT (umbreon ex psa 10) is more expensive than a decently conditioned 1ST EDITION BASE SET CHARIZARD (which is obtainable with some wear on the card). Next, the Pokémon community's social setting has deteriorated as a whole, especially the people that represent this community. A lot of the Youtubers that have been with this community for years have bought into the hype and have turned out to be pieces of shit. Leonhart especially pisses me off, and that \"trade up\" video he posted really rubbed me the wrong way. Whatnot has also gotten much worse (although in my opinion the platform wasn't the greatest) with these giant streamers inflating the prices of singles even more, with their massive toxic fanbases buying into their mindless ramble. I know the Pokémon Company isn't at fault entirely for the scalping of the modern sets, but I wish that they prepared a little bit better for it. A longer waiting period between sets would be welcomed with open arms if they had more time to stock up o",

The Question i have is why didn't psa grade it is it because its a regular silver prizm with a sticker auto added on and a beckett authenticated sticker on the back? Also Would any other companies grade it such as BGS/SGC?

But since a lot of people keep posting and asking, this'll break down what else you can try. **Why cant I find cards:** \\-2025 Popularity Surge and Price Bubble - Starting late 2024 Pokemon card popularity began to once again surge, with the surge came scarcity as product was unable to be fulfilled to meet demand. This unprecedented demand was met with surging prices as well beginning a ridiculous value increase spiral that has caught the eyes of not just the general public but also big money investors. The more money that gets focused into the hobby, the more people start to hear about it, and unfortunately the more people try finding opportunity to make money from others in the hobby. \\-Scalpers - These are the people who follow around card vendors, buy everything they can so that others cant get it, then flip it for 2x or 3x price. If you are dedicated and thorough you can make some serious money doing this BUT IT IS HIGHLY RISKY. One bad buy could tie up thousands and waste your time trying to sell. \\-Cardshops - In response to the popularity and scalpers, many shops have taken to raising prices themselves to take in as much profit while the market is hot. Some may be scalpers themselves hitting up stores to stock their own store, or they can be in cahoots with scalpers buying at just under market price to resell above market price since its still tough to find cards. Its a two way street that never benefits the general buyer. \\-Grading - You pay a company (hopefully reputable) to assess the condition of your card. This is usually done for 2 of the many reasons, protection or resale. Since factories are pumping cards out in a mad rush, quality control is terrible. If a card is assessed at Gem Mint condition (usually listed as a 10) then it is likely in the top percentage of condition for that card, this gives it a massive premium. A card worth $100 normally can jump to ",

Unfortunately, it wasn't temporary enough, as I showed up one day at the storage unit and the lock had been cut off and most of my things, including several bins of sports cards, sports memorabilia, and personal memories had been taken. My only saving grace was some of the more valuable cards were stashed in my apartment closet. I don't know a lot about the card collecting world but need advice on the best way to sell my 1998 Topps Chrome Preview Refractor #77 MJ card. It's a BGS 9. MT. According to Card Ladder, the historical selling prices for this card are: 3/20/25 Goldin Auction $4,392 PSA NM7 3/09/25 Fanatics Weekly Auction $7,800 PSA 8 NM-MT 02/10/25 Ebay Fixed Price $1,900 PSA 10 Gem MT 01/19/25 Fanatics Weekly Auction $4,560 PSA 8 NM-MT 01/05/25 Fanatics Weekly Auction $2,400 BGS 7 NRMT 12/24/24 Fanatics Buy Now $7,500 PSA 8 NM-MT 11/05/24 Ebay Buy Now $7,700 PSA 8 NM-MT On 08/24/24 at a Heritage auction, a PSA 10 Gem MT sold for $168,000 The numbers on this card seem to be wildly varied. Maybe that's just the sports card business in general. My question is...if it were your card...would you sell at auction, fixed price, or would you go the private sale route? I appreciate your insights in advance.",

I have a submission processing right now and I noticed something different when I got my grades revealed to me. After my grade reveal was done, PSA offered to buy my cards off me and gave me a 24 hour countdown to sell to them. Before this submission, my last order cleared in August and I got no such offer in the app or anywhere else. I can’t help but think that PSA, the company that grades cards, is intentionally downgrading certain cards with the hope that I’d sell to them, and they’d just regrade for a 10. I’m not a scrub. I did my due diligence of checking all cards and gently cleaning them before sending them out for grading. Boy was I surprised that only 8 out of 39 came back as 10’s. I can’t shake this feeling that there is an obvious incentive for PSA to screw me out of quality cards so they can auction it themselves in eBay. I dunno, maybe I’m overreacting. Am I crazy in thinking this?",

Which leads to, do card values always go up? if most of the \"leading\" cards I have will lost 50% (no idea) of its value over the next 3 years. I'd be very happy to sell the expensive cards and I'm still extremely perplexed why beautiful artworks are often £1 or similar. Apologies if this is triggering, I don't *think* it is, but I get everything wrong almost all the time.",

          "text": "Childhood binder, are these worth something? Hey Reddit, I hope this post is allowed in the sub. I’d really appreciate any help or guidance! I’ve pulled out my old binder from childhood and think there’s potential value in these nine cards. I quickly checked a US price chart website for the holo cards I have, but all the prices are in US dollars. The central card seems like it might be worth a bit, but there appear to be two versions. Mine doesn’t have the Japanese text, but I’m struggling to find a good UK price. What’s the best way to sell these and price them correctly? I’m in the UK and was thinking maybe eBay is the only option, or should I try to find an event nearby to take these to? Anything else I should look for to ensure what I have are legitimate? E.g. the Pichu card seems to be a lighter shade of blue on the back bs the others? Thanks! Edit: Ok... thank you Reddit! This is kind of mad... I genuinely thought I might get some feedback of having a few hundred pounds there and just stick them on Ebay, not quite the scale some people are now suggesting. will be buying some sleeves and \"top loaders\" asap! I'm also sticking to the advice of ignoring my DMs for selling these for now until I understand what I'm actually sitting on.",

Based on the feedback and discussion here, I decided to just list the card as a true auction and let the market figure it out rather than trying to guess a number. A few people asked to see what I’d do with it, so I wanted to follow up. It’s the same Lechonk from Obsidian Flames (2023), illustrated by Tomokazu Komiya, graded CGC 9 Error with the “Double Printing, 1 Side Blank” label. Nothing changed with the card itself, just sharing where it ended up. Here’s the listing if anyone wants to watch it or look at the photos/label more closely: https://www.ebay.com/itm/137017311806 Not posting this as price bait or hype, just closing the loop since I asked for opinions earlier. Appreciate everyone who chimed in and explained how they look at modern errors, especially Komiya stuff. If mods prefer this as a comment instead of a post, totally fine. Thanks again.",

Now that's a pretty limited run these days. Well surfing the net and watching some YouTube vids has shown me that Backyard Breaks had 50 cases, or 10% of the entire print run. Filthbomb was given a similar allocation, so now we are at about 20% of the print run without factoring in a single other breaker that gets allocation from Fanatics. Single boxes are so limited on the secondary market that they are going for 5x. There are a grand total of 23 available to purchase on eBay at the time I'm writing this. Call me a doomer - I don't really give a shit - but this is why you couldn't get Black & White or Bob Ross. And when you cant get those, and you don't want to pay 5x guess where you're gonna go - to the breakers. EQL or not, this is why these products are sold out in less than 5 minutes. Get used to only buying low end products or be a part of the problem and feed the breakers. When I can't get my hands on a case of Platinum Chrome Anniversary Fanatics I will officially be 100% vintage. Good luck everybody.",

          "text": "Jimmy's Pokemon Deal Finder - A site that finds deals on Pokemon cards on eBay A few years ago, I got into Pokemon collecting, and I'd look for good deals on cards on eBay. For each card I was interested in, I'd search the card on PriceCharting and compare the listing price to the valuation from PriceCharting. I found this really slow and tedious so wanted a way to automate it. I wrote an eBay scraper and PriceCharting scraper in Python that would show listings from eBay where the listing price was lower than the PriceCharting value. It output the best deals to a text file sorted by price different percent so I could see the best deals. This worked really well and I used it for a while to get some good cards. A few years later, I'd been making programming projects for my personal website and decided to turn the deal finder script into a website. Site: https://www.jimmysdealfinder.com I got it working and posted it to the Pokemon TCG subreddits and had really good foodback on it (as well as some fair criticism that I've used to improve the site). I monetized it with eBay affiliate links and I'm now making about £200 a month from the site, with a peak month of £530 a couple of months ago. I'm really happy with how it's come along, and people seem to be actually using the site to find good deals. I get about 25 users a day and the average engagement time is around 2-3 minutes. I'm planning to expand it to other collectibles such as retro video games, Magic the Gathering TCG, Yugioh, and sports cards. Let me know if you check it out and have any feedback or ideas to improve the site. :)",

          "text": "How Much Does an Amazon Agency Charge? A Complete Pricing Guide for 2026 Hiring an Amazon agency can be one of the most important investments you make in your ecommerce business. Whether you’re launching a new product or scaling an established brand, the right agency can accelerate growth, reduce costly mistakes, and take over the time-consuming day-to-day tasks of Amazon account management. But the first question every seller asks is simple: **How much does an Amazon agency charge?** The short answer: **Amazon agency pricing typically ranges from $500 to $10,000+ per month**, depending on: * size and maturity of your brand * number of SKUs * services included * ad spend management * marketplace expansion goals * revenue level and growth targets The long answer requires a breakdown of pricing models and what’s actually included — and that’s exactly what we’ll cover below. # Common Amazon agency pricing models Most Amazon agencies structure their fees using one or more of the following models: # 1. Flat monthly retainer This is the most common structure. You pay a fixed monthly fee for a defined scope of services. **Typical range:** ➡️ $500 – $6,000 per month Best for sellers who want predictable billing and ongoing account support such as: * listing optimization * SEO and keyword research * inventory planning * customer service support * reporting and analytics * account health management # 2. Percentage of revenue Some agencies charge a percentage of your **Amazon monthly sales**. **Typical range:** ➡️ 5% – 15% of revenue This pricing model aligns incentives — the agency grows when you grow — but can become expensive for high-revenue brands. # 3. Percentage of ad spend (for PPC management) If the agency manages Amazon advertising, they may charge based on your monthly ad budget. **Typical range:** ➡️ 8% – 20% of ad spend This often includes: * campaign creation and structure * bid optimization * keyword harvesting * A/B testing * DSP management (if applicable) # 4.",

Days went and nothing updated, I contacted the seller and asked if they have shipped the item yet or not. The seller responded with \"canceled due to problem with buyer's address\". No other message. Also, (and unsurprisingly) the items I won were relisted at a much higher price. I am guessing poor timing was the reason the auction ended up cheap, almost half of the comparable price from fixed price listing. Most people would have spent too much for Christmas and not have a few hundred dollars laying around to snap up a rare comic book. I reached out to eBay and explained the issue. Specifically, I had been using the same address with eBay for some 20 years, plus the seller's relisting for higher price, and suggested that seller may have lied in the reason for cancelation to avoid paying FVF. The cancellation reason in my purchase history got changed to \"seller canceled it\" Today I woke up to a ton of angry messages, the seller got hit with $200 in fees.

          "text": "I often point out that the “Hit Frequency by Format” numbers I post (parallels per box, cards per box, etc.) are cumulative averages across all boxes within a format. The more I’ve watched this product get ripped, the more it feels like certain formats, especially Breaker’s Delight, are disproportionately landing bigger hits. We’ve seen some truly absurd cases (looking at you u/blezsportscards). That got me wondering whether the numbers themselves could help validate or challenge that perception across both hobby and retail SKUs. **How I approached this:** Instead of focusing on per-box averages, I asked a different question: How many boxes of each format does it take to pull a “rare hit”? I looked at two buckets: 1) **Low-numbered parallels (≤50 copies)** This includes Gold, Orange, Black, Red, Super, and Frozenfractor parallels, along with those same parallels of Basketballs, Pulsars, Raywaves, and Geometrics. I also included Image Variation and Auto parallels numbered /50 or less. I understand there are meaningful hits numbered higher than 50 (ex: Flagg Blue Auto /150, Flagg Green Image Variation /99), but those apply to only a handful of players and don’t materially change format-level dynamics. 2) **Case Hit or tougher inserts** These include Rock Stars, Let’s Go!, Ultra Violet, Radiating Rookies, Helix, Lightboard Logos, Hidden Gems, Advisory, Glass Canvas, Paradox, Patented, Fanatical, Finals, and Gold Logomen. Using published odds, I can calculate the frequencies of low-numbered parallels and Case Hits without much trouble. What I cannot account for is name distribution. Odds don’t tell us which players land in which formats. If 90% of Gold Cooper Flagg autos are seeded into Jumbos, I can't help you there. The only way to know that is by watching rips. **Quick side note:** Some base Geometric insert and auto parallels are insanely rare. If the published odds are accurate (which I assume is the case because they are consistent), base Geometric parallels of co",

Third, if I do find what looks to be a decent auction I always seem to lose as \"second highest bidder\". This last one happens so often now it has to be something fishy (even though I don't have proof). I also used to frequent the CGC forum's, inventory also seems scarce there. Are people just sitting on big books because market is down? I know about ComicLink, MyComicShop, and Heritage but would prefer more eBay style auctions. I personally hate social media so don't do Instagram, or whatnot. The later I can't stand you can barely inspect the book before someone buys. I want good pictures, not someone holding it in front of a camera for 5 seconds telling me what the grade is. I want a chance to grade it myself. I just tried FB Marketplace but frankly good stuff is rare where I live. Am I missing someplace, where did all the eBay buyers/sellers go? Feels like the online market is splintered and while I hated eBay for fees, it was a pretty safe place for buyers and it was kind of nice almost everyone/thing was there.",

With a few tweaks, I installed it in a Supermicro chassis. At the time, I was mostly working on video compression and simulation. It worked, but the card consistently climbed to 85°C. When DeepSeek was released, I was impressed and installed Ollama in a container. With 24GB of VRAM, it worked—but slowly. After trying Stable Diffusion, it became clear that an upgrade was necessary. The main issue was finding a modern GPU that could actually **fit** in the server chassis. Standard 4090/5090 cards are designed for desktops: they're too large, and the power plug is inconveniently placed on top. After watching the LTT video featuring a modded 4090 with 48GB (and a follow-up from Gamers Nexus), I started searching the only place I knew might have one: Alibaba.com. I contacted a seller and got a quote: **CNY 22,900**. Pricey, but cheaper than expected. However, Alibaba enforces VAT collection, and I’ve had bad experiences with DHL—there was a non-zero chance I’d be charged twice for taxes. I was already over €700 in taxes and fees. Just for fun, I checked [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) and realized that for the same amount of money, I could fly to Hong Kong and back, with a few days to explore. After confirming with the seller that they’d meet me at their business location, I booked a flight and an Airbnb in Hong Kong. For context, I don’t speak Chinese at all. Finding the place using a Chinese address was tricky. Google Maps is useless in China, Apple Maps gave some clues, and Baidu Maps was beyond my skill level. With a little help from DeepSeek, I decoded the address and located the place in an industrial estate outside the city center. Thanks to Shenzhen’s extensive metro network, I didn’",

Back with another edition of the Lucky Egg Report! As always let me know if you have feedback for the report and if you would like to read this as a newsletter there is a link to the Lucky Egg Report in my profile 🙂. I'm thinking about adding a section to the report of some kind of top 10 trending cards list but I want to be thoughtful about how I present that data so its still easy to read and follow. If you have any suggestions let me know! **📋 TLDR** This week’s market was defined by broad-based strength across sealed, singles, and vintage segments. Modern sealed product continues to surprise, with Plasma Storm ETBs far outpacing expectations and Sky Legend booster boxes climbing alongside the stained-glass Tag Team Birds craze. Niche Japanese releases like the Pokékyun Collection are commanding steep premiums, driven by unique heart-foil art unavailable in Western prints. On the singles front, fresh Black Label Beckett submissions and Mega Charizard EX continue their upward trajectories, reflecting both scarcity dynamics and renewed set-release buzz. Meanwhile, vintage demand remains resilient, non-English Base Set first-editions and late-era gems like Skyridge Charizard are resetting price benchmarks and reminding investors that value persists in every corner of the Pokémon ecosystem. **📦 Sealed Product Market Highlights** * Black & White Plasma Storm ETB sells for $8.5k via eBay [auction](https://www.ebay.com/itm/167585792941) * The top chases from this set are Charizard 136 (in its shiny form), Articuno EX 132, and Lugia EX 134 as the top chase cards. * Sun & Moon Sky Legend Booster Box sells for $312.50 via eBay [auction](https://www.ebay.com/itm/365093369373?_skw=Pok",

Before we get any of the standard \"but...\" comments, this is for a specific set of people, if your not one of them, thats great I still hope you learn something. What You Will Need: 1. GB/GBC Pokemon Repro Cart (Haven't worked with gen 3 yet) The one your looking for usually has a 2017 on the back of the board (seen easiest on crystal) You'll know you have one if the game freezes and the music stops for more then 5 seconds when trying to save. 2. Soldering Iron and the skill to use it (Seriously burns suck) 3. Gameboy Cart Flasher (Tested this method with the GBX and \"Flash Boy\") 4. CR2025/CR1616 Batteries (Tabbed) (Tape and wire if you are working on gen 2, as the 2025 batteries are larger than the board tabs) 5. Rom of the game (Obtained however). What We're Doing: We are trying to remove as much \"jank\" from these as possible to make them more playable and accessible to anyone who either doesn't want to sell a kidney, wants to get a copy of green working, or just wants more copies to trade/hunt on. We will be soldering a battery to the board, and flashing the proper rom, so it will properly use the battery and SRAM (This will work with FRAM too, this is just not the guide for it.) Let's Do It! : 1. Solder the new battery to the board, (For Gen 2 you will need to solder wires and tape down your battery). 2. Clean the board, you never know how dirty the rom and ram chips can get, and pop it into your flasher. 3. Flash your game and test it, save the game and reset to see if it holds, if it did congrats you have a fully working game with much less jank and didn't have to sell a kidney. Questions I Expect To Hear (If this post stays up): 1. Why not just use FRAM? You can I prefer the authentic feel of the original gen 1/2 games with the time limits of the batteries, and have the tools to replace them. If you would prefer FRAM, follow a guide on youtube as your not alone, and people have done it before. 2. How do I m",

          "text": "Who’s in the wrong here? (Card show drama) I was at the Dallas card show last weekend, and on the last day, I spotted a card I really wanted for my personal collection. Before I made an offer, I overheard the vendor telling a friend that he hadn’t sold much at all he’d mostly been buying and he was complaining about there being too many flippers and not enough true collectors at the show. The card itself wasn’t super expensive, but it was an RPA of a player most people have forgotten, and I love collecting him. These cards rarely pop up, so despite the vendor being about $130 over the last comp, I still agreed to pay his price. I even offered him a trade, where I’d give him a much more liquid (and more valuable) card in exchange for his, but he valued my card at only half of what it was worth while he was still charging about 75% over comps for his own. Ultimately, I just decided to pay cash outright. We shook hands, and as I started counting out the money, he said, “You know what, seeing how much you want this card, I think I should just keep it.” I was in disbelief. I even tried to pay his full sticker price, which was $15 higher than our agreed amount, but he still refused to sell it. As I was walking away, I said, “I guess that’s why your case is still full.” He got really upset and accused me of taking a cheap shot as I left. I told him he was just being fragile, and he fired back that I was mad I didn’t get my way. I pointed out that we had a deal how was I not getting my way when we’d already agreed on a price? Things got a bit heated, but we ended up just going our separate ways. I just don’t know why you set up at a card show and someone’s offering you way more than you would get on eBay after fees and you still won’t sell a card no one wanted all weekend. Then get mad when someone points out your behavior as a reason as to why you haven’t sold anything. I think the guy needed a wakeup call. I don’t regret anything I said.",

Based on condition guides it seems like this would fall under MP with TCG Player showing an average price of between $30 and $40. eBay pricing seems similar and I have it up for $29 but I have received a couple offers for $20 and I feel like it’s a bit of a lowball. For context, one of the offers was from someone else who sells cards which made me think they might try to flip it? I’m trying to make a little extra for my family so while I don’t want to rip anyone off, I don’t want to take significantly less than it’s worth. Can someone help me with my estimate? What would you pay seeing this card? I know it’s on the rougher end of the MP spectrum, I’m just struggling with the right number. Thanks!",

          "text": "Anyone wanting to sell on ebay, please read this With how fast our hobby is growing, this needs to be discussed. Ive had this happen too many times now and i had to make this post to get it off my chest. I just had the 102/108 mega blastoise from evolutions i purchased on ebay come in bent to sh**, totally ruined and creased. No top loader or cardboard used in packaging. Ive been looking for a clean copy of this card for weeks now and this one looked great, ZERO whitening on the back edges or corners. What a shame. This particular seller has over 900 items sold and 99% feedback so even some experienced sellers slip up. Ive been selling cards on ebay for a couple years now and wanted to give some tips for anyone wanting to sell cards online. I feel its really necessary to sell some cards, at least for me, to be able to continue collecting. I remember being intimidated going into it so I hope i can help even just one person out there reading this. Here is what i do, and i know a lot of people have different methods that work as well. This is just what is easiest for me, and what i feel is easiest for the buyer when they have to unpackage it. #Step 1 - Put card in sleeve. Pretty simple, i would go get brand new sleeves if youre wanting to sell a decent amount.(You can get 100 sleeves for $1-2 at your lcs, target, etc)You want your buyers to feel like theyre opening something of quality even down to the sleeve. Old/used sleeves dont look good and can have little specks in it that can actually damage the card in transit, especially in envelopes. The envelopes are run through usps machines that are very thin and can press the card down against any particles and leave damage on the card. #Step 2 - Put card in toploader. Top loaders can be found almost anywhere that sells trading cards. You want the thinnest top loaders possible for pokemon, which is 35 pt. I personally get 100 for $11 online. I also have some 55pt and 100 pt for card lots. Again, i prefer to use brand new ",

I’ve heard that they are getting and already have gained some new and solid support. I was planning on getting myself the singles I’m missing to upgrade my old Branded Deck to being viable to what the current meta is. Problem is that since I already have most of the cards, buying three of the chronicles deck would be a waste but getting just the cards I’m missing would be about 40 CAD (since TCGplayer sucks in Canada and on Ebay the prices are very marked up) which, with just 10 dollars more, I could buy 3 of the new blue eyes structure deck and build a Blue Eyes deck. I like both Blue Eyes and Branded but I have a bit more experience with Branded having gone to a few locals with it. I’m undecided between the two as I don’t want to invest my money in Blue Eyes if it’s going to drop off the planet in a week and I don’t feel right that 40 bucks is worth the few support cards I’m missing.",

          "text": "Top 7 Mercury alternatives and competitors in 2026 Over the past couple of years, businesses using Mercury Bank have faced significant changes. The digital bank, known for its ease of use and robust financial tools, [announced plans to close accounts](https://techcabal.com/2024/07/23/us-bank-mercury-to-close-accounts-of-nigerian-startups/) for startups in 37 countries, including 13 in Africa, by August 22, 2024. These changes stemmed from updated compliance policies and increased oversight from federal regulators, leaving many businesses scrambling for new banking solutions. As Mercury tightens its eligibility requirements, startups are forced to adapt quickly and find alternatives that meet their operational needs. Here’s what you need to know about Mercury Bank’s policy changes and the best alternatives to switch to in 2026. # What happened with Mercury Bank? Mercury Bank stopped serving startups tied to certain countries, citing compliance challenges. Federal auditing of its partner bank, Choice Bank, revealed risky account openings in restricted regions, pushing Mercury to implement stricter policies. Many of the affected countries are on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) “grey list,” which flags them for inadequate measures to counter financial risks. # Who is affected? * **Ukrainian founders**: Mercury no longer supports companies based in Ukraine, though US-based founders with Ukrainian passports are still eligible. * **Nigerian founders**: US-based Nigerian startups face similar restrictions, with Mercury pointing to compliance risks tied to FATF review. * **Other regions**: Croatia and previously restricted regions in Africa are also impacted, further narrowing Mercury’s customer base. # What does this mean for startups and small businesses? Startups in affected regions now face the urgent challenge of securing reliable banking alternatives to maintain operations. For many, this disruption emphasizes the need to partner with financial institutions that",

My personal preference is visiting a website like [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game) to search for the card details. Alternatively, one can also use any search engine by typing the name of the Pokemon and the set number. This will usually give an image match with which the other details can be found out.

I had all my cards from the 80/90s stolen but recently started to get interested in collecting a handful of my favorite players. I'm not a fan of the company Fanatics and them buying Topps turned me off from buying packs. Instead of directly giving Fanatics money I'm buying individual cards on ebay.

          "text": "A Guide to Determining Your Card's Value Hi fellow collectors! Recently I've seen a lot of posts or inquires with folks trying to determine the value of their pulls, so I decided to put a little post together to try and assist anyone that doesn't collect cards regularly. As someone who collects TCG's, CCG's, and sports cards, I have a lot of experience in this arena and thought I would share. First off - Halo Legacy is more like sports cards and less like Pokemon, Magic, or Yu-Gi-Ho in that there isn't a game to be played with the cards, so instead of value being determined by card usefulness or predetermined rarity, it's determined by hype and the market. Just like a first printing of a high draft pick or a talented rookie, the market demand is hot at first, but then cools off depending on printing and performance. Halo Legacy performs in the same way - except that the market cools off as more product becomes available the further we get from launch in February of 2025. It's simple supply and demand - when supply is low at card launch, demand is higher, as are prices. As people open more packs and get more cards, supply increases, and demand starts to waver, driving prices down. Second - where to determine value is key. With most TCG's and sports cards, there are multiple avenues - Facebook groups, dedicated subreddits like this one, sports card shows, Beckett magazine (I'm dating myself here), in-person events, auctions, and of course - eBay. Although our sub is growing, we're still quite small - even the dead-for-nearly-20-years Lord of the Rings TCG sub has twice as many members. For contrast, Pokemon TCG has 800K+ members and baseball cards has 150K+ members. Unfortunately, with smaller FB groups and subreddits, determining value usually comes down to just one thing - and that's eBay sales. The best way to search sold auctions on eBay is through 130point, I'll put the link below for easy access. [www.130point.com](http://www.130point.com) I'm including an examp",

I don't really care for the Pokémon or the art but if there is only one eBay would I get an offer or would i just be stuck with it, id rather keep a 10 then sell for a loss.

Here are the main channels I know and use to buy and sell autographed hats, jerseys, cards, and memorabilia — curious to hear which ones you trust most and why. Buy & Sell type eBay Still the biggest marketplace by far. Huge audience, auctions or Buy It Now. Great for liquidity, but you really need to know what you’re doing with authentication. Goldin More high-end, auction-focused. Best for rare or valuable signed pieces. Not ideal for low-value items, but strong buyer confidence. Fanatics Collect Growing fast. Focused on authenticated items with auctions and vaulting. Feels more “modern” and collector-oriented. Pristine Marketplace / Pristine Auctions Very popular for signed memorabilia. Lots of daily auctions, especially for hats, jerseys, and photos. Beckett Marketplace Good if you’re already dealing with graded cards or Beckett-authenticated items. I know these Specialty Memorabilia Shops (Mostly Buying, Sometimes Consignment) SportsMemorabilia.com Pro Am Sports (Canada) Frameworth (Canada) Imperial Sports (Canada) Mintink (cards & autos) East Coast Sports Collectibles These are great for buying with confidence, though prices can be higher than peer-to-peer marketplaces. Which platforms do YOU trust the most for signed caps or memorabilia? Where have you gotten your best deals? Any platforms you avoid — and why? Are there any underrated sites or communities I’m missing? Always good to learn from other collectors.",

          "text": "PSA Vault Ebay Auction Im looking for some clarity on a risk i am taking. Ive recently been grading a large amount monthly. Currently I have 85 PSA 10 slabs, and 55 PSA 9s. Alot of them are duplicate cards. I decided to list around 10 per day through the vault on ebay for the next 7 days with a $0.99 auction start. Market value is around 350 per psa 10 with around 7-16 sold daily according to cardladder, ebay sold, and Pricecharting. My goal with this was to get closer to 87% per sale instead of PSA buyback offers of 72%. Essentially im curious if psa auctions typically go way under market in a auction or if the market follows reported sales data. Does anyone else have experience with this?",

          "text": "Very, Very, Very Big: The Case for Macy's, Children's Place, and the GameStop Roll-Up The eBay thesis keeps showing up and I need to explain why it falls apart and what actually makes sense when you follow the money and the pattern. **Why eBay Doesn't Work** eBay is a $42 billion company near all-time highs with 2.9% short interest. No distress. No squeeze potential. GameStop already partners with PSA for authentication and PSA owns the eBay vault, so that synergy exists without buying anything. You don't acquire something 4x your size with cash anyway. That's not how this works. **What Cohen Actually Said This Week** In interviews with CNBC and the Wall Street Journal, Cohen laid out exactly what he's hunting for. He's looking in the \"consumer or retail\" sector for something \"very, very, very big\" and \"transformational.\" A publicly traded company that's currently undervalued but is \"high quality, durable, scalable with growth prospects.\" He wants \"diamonds in the rough\" with a \"sleepy management team\" behind the wheel. He called this strategy \"way more compelling than bitcoin\" and compared it to Berkshire Hathaway, \"except what Berkshire did in decades, we're attempting to do in a much shorter time.\" The plan is to \"apply the Cxxxy and GameStop mindset of brutal efficiency and increase the profitability of the company very, very quickly.\" He also filed an SEC 13D stating he \"believes that any Chief Executive Officer who fails to buy stock in the open market with their own personal funds should be fired.\" eBay is a tech platform. That's neither transformational nor retail nor unprecedented. **The Targets That May Actually Fit** **Macy's:** - Market cap around $4.8-5.5 billion - Down 70%+ from highs - Short interest around 7% - Generates roughly $1 billion+ annual EBITDA - Owns an estimated $5-8 billion in real estate - Anchor tenant in hundreds of malls - 450 Macy's stores plus 268 Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury stores - 167 year history **Children's Place:** - Mark",

It is not written in any moderator capacity and the subreddit does not take responsibility nor endorse any specific sellers or services mentioned.*** ***Likewise, there will be several websites linked in the guide.

Japan is where Pokemon started and for many collectors like me it offers an affordable way to collect Pokemon cards. You can get your hands on exclusive promos, cards with better print quality and also access to some earlier releases than other languages. Japan also has access to a deeper and more diverse secondary market which is very useful to collectors who want to get a taste of the history of Japanese cards across various eras. At the same time, buying from Japan while living in India can feel confusing and risky due to unfamiliar services (proxy, forwarding, consolidation), customs uncertainty and an overall lack of clear, beginner-friendly explanations. The goal is simple, this guide is aimed to help you understand your options so you can make informed decisions. **This is a tool only and not a cheat code that you can blindly follow.** # Who This Guide Is For My aim with this guide is to reach, \\- Indian collectors curious about importing from Japan. \\- Collectors who deal in singles and focus on binders. Although there is no limit to the type of product you can buy. \\- People overwhelmed by terms like proxy, forwarde",

It should be obvious by now, PSA Vault is in a total mess likely something went terribly wrong where they got hacked or scammed which caused all of the chaos in recent days. To summarize: 1. Majority of PSA Vault seller payouts are paused since mid Jan, no real explanation given - this email I believe is one of the corrective action they are making to resolve whatever mess that happened internally. 2. Buyers who purchased from PSA via ebay has their orders frozen, usually the order results in the slab in PSA Vault transferred to the buyer near instant closing out the transaction. Currently it is not transferred and stuck in payment complete phase. Concerns are buyer may be able to file item not received after the ebay timeline (30 days I believe) for money back, and what happens then? This issue is believed to be related to above 3. Same linked ebay accounts are blocked from purchasing from ebay PSA seller (no bids, no buy now, no best offer), others had their login blocked altogether. Again just happens suddenly, no explanation given to accounts in good standing without any issues. PSA and PSA Vault completely refuse to address the issue, only directing the affected customers to message PSA seller via ebay message, but no response is ever received from ebay PSA seller. 4. Ebay authentication to PSA vault purchase has a delay of 4+ weeks from authentication complete to be available in the PSA Vault ready for buyer's actions. This means it takes at least this much time after you made the purchase, not including shipping time, to be able to do anything with your slabs. And you need to track each during all this time, major pain for high volume buyers. This is existing process NOT related to the new mess above, added here for completeness. The wors",

I hear you and completely understand your concern regarding the delayed payment for a sold card in your Vault, and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and concern this situation has caused. The delay is due to a technical issue that we’ve been actively working through with our internal teams and our payment partner, Stripe. Please know that we hear your concerns and are very sorry for any frustration this may have caused. We’ve made a temporary operational adjustment to payout timing in coordination with eBay. During this period, payouts from eBay sales may take up to five business days to process after the buyer submits payment. Once the payout is released, please allow an additional one to three business days for the funds to fully process and appear in your bank account, depending on your financial institution. We understand how frustrating delays like this can be and truly appreciate your patience while this temporary adjustment remains in place. Please note that PSA Partner Offer payouts are not impacted and continue to process within one to two business days. If, after this timeframe, you still do not see the payment reflected for this card, please feel free to reply directly to this ticket and I will be happy to look into it further for you.

          "text": "Vault and eBay In September I went to a PSA submission event at Real Sportscards in Champlain MN, mind that this is a direct PSA event with PSA employees present taking grading and Vault submissions. I did a drop off for a 52 item grading order and submitted another 40ish cards to the vault. PSA was in charge of all packaging and shipping of the vaulted items. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago when I try listing a PSA 10 Jaxon Smith Njigba Panini Legacy Rookie auto pink/gold /10. It won’t list, try it again, it won’t list. Try again the next day, still doesn’t work. I reach out to the vault to find out what’s up and I get a response in about 12 hours. Vault employee tells me the card was damaged during transit to PSA and that I should talk to MY mailman. Uhm no... this was a submission that was transited by PSA from an event, damage insurance coverage is on them. He also sent me a picture of the supposed damage. The card looks exactly like it did in its grade reveal... so #1. I don’t believe that it is damaged at all and that it is just coded wrong and they’re not pulling the card out to actually look at it. I wasn’t notified of any damage when my cards were vaulted. So if it was damaged and couldn’t be sold why would I want it to continue to be in the vault? #2. If it actually is damaged, the rep says specifically in the message that it looks to have been damaged in transit - the cards were all verified prior to the submission with a rep who closely examined them and actually gave me back several other cards he determined to not be eligible for the vault due to damage. So similar to how they force place insurance on us via premiums above the regular fees, what insurance does PSA have on things they ship from events? Compensation is due if the damage was caused by their shipping method. Right? #3. It really sucks to have a vaulted card that could easily bring in multiples of its predicted value due to the Seahawks now going to the Super Bowl. It’s a /10 PSA 10 r",

          "text": "I got tired of using 5 different apps to price cards for my shop, so I built my own AI-powered alternative. (Beta Access) I own a small card shop in the UK (Devon based!), and for years I’ve been frustrated with the \"pricing shuffle\"—switching between eBay, a calculator, five different pricing apps, and static price guides just to give a customer a fair price. It was slow, and half the time the data was lagging or inaccurate. So, I decided to do something about it. I’ve spent the last few months building **Price This**—a fully AI-powered intelligent market pricing system. **What makes it different?** **1. The \"Ultimate Average\" (Base Layer):** We don't just guess. We pull data from **PriceCharting, CardMarket, TCGPlayer, and Google results**, extrapolating and averaging their market prices to establish a solid global baseline. **2. The AI & Real-Time Intelligence (Top-Spec Layer):** Once we have that baseline, we apply our **Human-Reasoning AI** and **Official eBay Partner Data**. Instead of just using \"Yesterday's Data,\" the AI detects changes in real-time. It filters out \"wash trading,\" shill bids, and outliers. It \"thinks\" like you do: *\"Oh, one just sold for this much? It's from this set, this era, holds this popularity... therefore the real-time price is THIS.\"* **3. Kiosk Mode:** A feature I built specifically for vendors/traders. You can visualize a trade live, input cash vs. trade credit, and let the app calculate the mathematically perfect deal. **4. The Vault:** Tracks your profit, not just value. See your buy-in cost vs. current value and get volatility warnings before a card crashes. **I’m just one guy building this.** We aren't a massive corporation. It’s just me and a friend, building this for the community. **We launch Early Access on Feb 1st.** Most of the app (including the AI pricing) is free. If you join the beta now, you get a **Founders Badge** and a permanent discount on any future Pro features. I’d love for you to roast it, break it, and tell ",

I access eBay using “sign in with Apple.” Without thinking, I sent some cards purchased on eBay directly to the PSA Vault. I decided I wanted to withdraw one of the cards but when I go to PSA, the cards don’t show in my collection because apparently the email on eBay and PSA don’t match. I contacted eBay support and after waiting a week they called and basically said I needed to create a new PSA account with my eBay email and the cards should be there. However since I sign into eBay with Apple, it’s not like there’s a real email address I can use, as it’s just a private relay. Further, when I try, I never get the 2FA code. I filled out a contact form on PSA to inform about the situation and ask for next steps but haven’t heard back yet. How do I get my cards? Feeling regretful and worried—wish all of these services were integrated to make this easier. Thanks in advance",

And surprinsingly to me most cards are priced just at what Card Ladder says then with the 5% off and the 2% points back I get a good price. I am sending them all to the PSA Vault so no taxes either. I gotta say it makes the whole process frictionless. and has me checking periodically for new ones. I do have like 10 enhacements I could suggest them but its good enough. 🚀",

          "text": "PSA Vault-EBay Arbitrage I’ve always thought about this, but this is the first time I’ve seen something this explicit. I have no way to confirm this is what happened or was carried out, but let me set up/propose the following scenario. You have 2 or more moderately valued cards in the PSA Vault. You take 1 copy and set it as “buy it now” through PSA on EBay for 3-4x the real value. You then proceed to buy your own card. You initially lose the 13% for selling fees. However, Card Ladder, which the large majority of the time, uses the last sale to calculate the value, now reflects this monster sale. The Card Ladder value is what PSA uses to calculate preferred partner offers. From what I have seen, that last sale/Card Ladder value makes its way to the PSA calculated offer in a fairly reasonable time. Additional sales may trickle in, but there’s usually at least a transient period of time where the offer is calculated based on that one, high sale. Case example: CZ Mewtwo Vstar sold through PSA Vault on eBay for $1499 yesterday. Math: Card sold to yourself for $1500. You receive $1305 payout after fees (Net -$195). PSA Partner offer for your other copy in the vault becomes ~$1075 (70-75% of the $1500 Card Ladder value). After accepting, you net $880, roughly 2.4x the real value of the card. Obviously there’s a lot of uncertainties with this thought, but after coming across the attached sale yesterday, it made me question if someone actually attempted to execute this plan that has definitely crossed my mind lol.",

PE investors (including Steve Cohen’s family office) need an exit after 5 years. GameStop has $9B+ in cash.

One month earlier, GameStop became an authorized PSA dealer. Ryan Cohen’s board is tight and hand-picked. You don’t get a seat for a dealer agreement. Turner receives no compensation for his board role. He’s the CEO of a company valued at $4.3 billion, sitting on GameStop’s board for free. **Why?** Because when this deal closes, he’ll be one of the largest GameStop shareholders. ----- ##What is Collectors Holdings?

          "text": "A Guide to Expected Value: How to See If a Card is Profitable to Grade Hey everyone. I am planning to do a regular series going through the most profitable cards to buy and grade, but first I want to have a guideline to find the Expected Value of grading a card. I tried to make this beginner friendly, so bear with me if this feels too basic. Anyways... This is a guide to finding the Expected Value (EV) of grading a card. We find that this is one of the most important concepts to buying and grading cards profitably! The idea is that we look for cards where the EV of grading the card is significantly higher than the cost of buying it. While a positive EV does **not** guarantee that every purchase will be profitable, it does mean on average your purchases will be profitable if you’re buying 10s, 100s, or 1,000s of cards. I think it’s important that you guys know, this is *exactly* how we approach buying cards in our business. We have our card evaluation spreadsheet structured to follow this exact logic, and had really strong success in 2025 with a net profit margin of 24% and total ROI on card purchases of 35%. # Finding the Market Values To determine the expected value of any card, first we’re going to look at the PSA 9 and PSA 10 values of the cards. We generally assume that a card will grade as either a PSA 9 or a PSA 10. There’s a few reasons that this works. 1. We buy mostly Ultra Modern cards. These have a very high probability of grading as a 9 or 10. 2. We aim for a minimum of a 25% expected return on investment (ROI) for every card we purchase. This gives us more than enough margin of error to get a couple of PSA 8s or worse and still make profit. You’ll see more on ROI in a later section. You can find the graded values of your cards using eBay’s Product Research tool or market research services like CardLadder. Let’s use a simple example card that we will use throughout this tutorial. * PSA 10 Value: $2,000 * PSA 9 Value: $1,000 * Raw Price: $1,000 # Gem Rate",

          "text": "PSA Vault Withdrawal Experience: Consumer Beware I like the general concept of the PSA Vault. Recently I had a few cards that have been in the vault for about 6 months that I wanted to withdraw as gifts for Christmas—I didn’t think it would be a big issue. However after waiting over 2 business weeks for them to ship my cards I received no confirmation. When I reached out the representative said: *We're currently working through a high volume of collectibles, and most orders are shipping within 14-16 business days of the request. However, this is only an estimate, so it's possible it could be slightly sooner or longer.* I asked for the withdrawal to be canceled (they never even left my vault) and they said yes. When I asked for a refund for the withdraw fee and shipping they said they are both non-refundable. I can kind of understand the withdrawal fee being non-refundable but the shipping fee when the item was never shipped should be refunded. I asked to speak to their supervisor and was stone walled—at that point I’m pretty sure I was talking to AI. (Funny how they hire AI customer support but not AI grading). If a bank or brokerage firm did not allow me to withdraw my funds in a timely manner they would be defunct. PSA Vault not having their logistics together enough to simply ship stored items is insane and really diminishes the product as a whole. I’m very disappointed in the withdrawal feature of PSA Vault and seriously makes me reconsider using them as my default shipping location going forward. I just wanted to let you all know this experience in case you were wondering what the withdrawal service was like. **TLDR: PSA Vault has a terrible withdrawal service and I don’t recommend anyone relying on it.**",

          "text": "Ebay - PSA Vault Auctions - 60 Minute Auto-pay? On eBay I place bids on PSA auctions ending that day. I typically win a few and have been paying for everything at once in the evening before bed. Recently, however, it seems that the PSA Store on eBay has a 60-minute auto-pay enabled. Auto-pay itself is fine, but I need all of the cards I purchase to remain in the PSA Vault. The issue is that auto-pay defaults to shipping the cards to my home. Most of the time I catch it in time and change the option, but sometimes I’m busy in the evening and miss the window before auto-pay triggers, preventing me from selecting the vault option. Does anyone know how to turn off the 60-minute auto-pay? Or have the default shipping option go to my vault? I’ve gone through all of my eBay settings and can’t find anything related to this. I’ve also messaged PSA through eBay and contacted eBay support, but so far I’ve only received generic responses with no clear answer. Thanks!",

          "text": "Current Vault Shipping Experience Recently got a high value card (~12k) graded and originally shipped it to vault to sell on EBay. It took a couple weeks for vault shipping to go through but then I experienced weeks of issues and 2 tickets with PSA where no matter how many times I tried to list on EBay, it would never work. After a month of dealing with that, I decided to ship back to me and I’ll sell myself. And the point of the post is this is the current timeframe you can expect shipping from the vault: 15 Nov: Paid to ship from vault, cost $13 total including under 90 day fee. Status changed to “shipped” but did not receive a tracking number. Nothing for almost a month... 12 Dec: I finally cracked and decided to make another ticket. As I was typing of the ticket I decided to check my email one last time and somehow got the shipping info at that exact moment. 16 Dec: card arrived, signature required. Just awareness for anyone waiting on vault shipping so that you don’t panic when weeks go by without hearing anything.",

          "text": "From Ecuador, trying to build tools for collectors — not just another grading label. I’m a long-time collector from Ecuador who somehow ended up running a small grading project. Instead of doing a pure “look at my company” post, I wanted to share what we’re trying to build and ask if this actually makes sense from a collector’s point of view. Context: collecting from Latin America If you live in the US, you send your cards to PSA/BGS/CGC and that’s it. If you live in most of Latin America, it’s a mess: you ship through intermediaries you pay crazy shipping and customs you wait months and you still don’t have any real digital way to manage your collection I’m trying to solve that problem first, and grading is just the entry point. The project is called OGS (Opulence Grading System), based in Ecuador, but the idea is bigger than just slabbing cards. --- The idea: a “collector tools” platform, not a marketplace clone What we’re building inside the user account is basically: 1. Ownership transfer between users If two collectors trade/sell peer-to-peer, they can move the card from one account to another inside the system. No marketplace, no listing fees – just a record of who currently owns it. 2. Ability to “release” a card If you sell a card outside the platform (show, Instagram, eBay, whatever), you can release it so the next owner can claim it. That way there aren’t 5 people saying “that card is mine” years later. 3. A real collection manager Front/back images, serial, grade details, ownership status – all in one place. Nothing fancy visually yet, but functional. 4. Things we want to add if the base works direct send-to-auction for some houses AI-assisted pre-grading digital vaulting population reports an optional “trust”/reputation layer for peer-to-peer deals optional public profiles for people who actually want visibility This is not meant to replace eBay or MySlabs or anything like that. The goal is simply to give people in this region tools we never had.",

          "text": "📌 PSAPowerPacks — FAQ Welcome everyone to PSAPowerPacks. Given the influx of new members and how fast we are growing I thought it best to make a FAQ. It addresses many of the common questions I see being posted from day to day. Here we go: **❓ What are Power Packs?** Power Packs is a collaboration between GameStop and PSA. Power Packs are digital packs you rip online to reveal a PSA-graded card. Once revealed, you can choose to have the physical card shipped to you within the U.S., sell it on the Power Packs website, or keep the card securely stored in your PSA Vault. Currently, Power Packs may only be purchased by residents of the United States who are at least 18 years of age. Official website is [here](https://powerpacks.gamestop.com/packs) ❓ How do I get access? Power Packs currently require beta access through the official site: [here](https://www.gamestop.com/preview). You need to sign up by entering your email. It will then require a wait. Keep checking your email for a notification of when you get access. It can take some time, and may not be guaranteed. ❓ What are the pack tiers? There are five pack levels: Starter, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and newly added Lunar. The cost of a pack increases as the levels increase, and you’ll be able to see these prices before purchasing. Higher pack levels give you a chance at getting higher-value cards but do not guarantee it. Before you purchase a pack, Power Packs displays the chances that the card contained in a given pack level will fall within certain value ranges. These card values are calculated and updated automatically every 5 minutes. ❓ I just pulled a pack, now what? After opening a pack, the card sits in your PSA Vault. From there you can: * Keep it stored in your digital Vault to ship or sell in the future * Ship it to yourself * Sell back at 90% - or wait for Power Packs offer to expire for a possible offer from PSA Note: you can select multiple slabs to be shipped if you want them to come together,.",

It first started when I got the email from GameStop promoting beta access to their Power Pack site. I started on the small packs, but got nothing too great. Then I got my first chase from the $100 pack, the Surging Sparks Pikachu (at the time worth $900-$1000). [First Chase Hit](https://preview.redd.it/dwbqjafj5x4g1.png?width=1863&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcb1b3f908306e7d54a1af3127c4094b9e774b85) It all spiraled down from there. Kept on spending, selling pack, and \"pulling\" the lever so to speak. I cashed out when I \"won\", but had a tendency to push my luck. And as a result, I kept losing to the house which is the Power Pack casino. Thousands and thousands of dollars down the drain within less than a month. All spent on credit cards. As I pulled more and more, I got a few hits, but a LOT of misses. Then the Lunar Packs got announced and I rolled twice. First time, I broke \"even\" with a PSA 9 #4 Charizard (worth $1.8k to $3.3k) [First Lunar Pack](https://preview.redd.it/lntkmjzk5x4g1.png?width=1849&format=png&auto=webp&s=78a565342d8c13d6ad9579cdafec809d68df2815) Then my second Lunar Pack, I got the #17 Umbreon Gold Star (worth $11,750) and instantly sold it. I later checked the sale history for this card and I was SO FUCKING LUCKY that the last one sold for $11k on eBay for GameStop to even offer that big of a buyback. [Second Lunar Pack](https://preview.redd.it/1o41gecw5x4g1.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e94c958e275766ead4ee9169bb5263371f71e20) [Not Taking Any Chances](https://preview.redd.it/eerz8edo5x4g1.png?width=1773&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b44caeff830c11f904247f4dcd223cca0dc6ceb) If there was any notion of a sign to get the fuck out, this was it. I immediately cashed out my earnings, signed out, blocked the website, blocked site scripts and locked my all high credit limit credits c",

This card for some reason didn't have the checkbox that says \"Transfer to PSA Vault\". So contacted the PSA seller and got the same reply twice. \"Just check the box\". The box isn't there. So contacted Ebay and was bounced around to different support departments. Even one that handles the PSA stuff. Took over an hour and said they would research and email me the conclusion. Problem is it pays and auto-ships in 3 days and don't want it shipped (plus I would be charged tax and a shipping fee). Card is around $100. Anybody experience this before?",

          "text": "Ebay Sent Card to Wrong PSA Vault Email I purchased a card on ebay to send to PSA vault. I do this all the time seamlessly. However, one card has been stuck on \"shipped to PSA vault\" for a long time, and I have not received the confirmation that the card is \"Vaulted\" by PSA. The other problem is that this card never said \"To Vault\" in the PSA app like most cards to when in transit, though it did automatically appear in my collection. I contacted PSA about this issue and they gave me a canned response saying that the card is indeed secured in the vault, but attached to the wrong email. They suggest I make an account to link ebay to PSA, but I have obviously already done that. I used the same ebay email and everything (which is done automatically) that I always do, this cannot possibly be my fault. I'm waiting on their response, but this does not seem promising. Anyone else experience something like this?",

          "text": "BEWARE selling on eBay through PSA Hi all. Figured I would share my experience with selling some graded cards on eBay through PSA after they are done grading. I’ve avoided it for a long time but lately have relented on a few orders because of how long PSA takes to send my cards back to me after completing the grades. (They used to get shipped back same day, now PSA holds them hostage for a week with the hopes I will let them sell the cards and make even more money off of me) So first of all- the positives. It does remove the hassle of listing, selling and shipping the cards yourself. Additionally, once payment is received from the buyer you are safe and the money is yours. (No worrying about the buyer claiming the slab is damaged or pulling some sort of scam). Also, the fee structure can be slightly more favorable than eBay. Another relatively nice positive is that PSA will give you cash offers for your vaulted slabs on occasion. The offers are, in my experience, usually very competitive and close to what you’d make if you sold it on eBay (sometimes even a bit more). That all sounds great, but there are some glaring negatives. For whatever reason, PSA is very lenient with allowing buyers to pay for the slabs once they are purchased. I believe they give the buyer 7 days to pay regardless of whether it’s an auction or a Buy it Now listing. This leads to many buyers who simply don’t pay and you have no way to contact the buyer and no recourse. This is very annoying and I don’t understand why it works this way. When selling on eBay myself, I can require immediate payment for buy-it-now listings. Why doesn’t PSA do this? Who knows. Maybe they don’t want to deal with chargebacks. That leads me to the real reason I made this post and why I won’t ever recommend selling valuable slabs through this service. If you sell a buy it now listing through PSA and the buyer flakes, your card enters some sort of weird purgatory phase. It shows up as being listed on eBay in your vault, ",

Buyers rip packs online, receive real slabbed cards, and can choose to vault, resell, or ship them. GameStop earns on pack sales, instant buybacks (at \\~90% of card value), and Pro membership upgrades. 📈 **Base case: $120M in annual profit** 💥 **Scaled adoption: $250M+** 💡 And it’s not built on crypto, JPEGs, or hype. These are tangible, tradable assets with embedded resale value. # The Core Idea Power Packs are not digital skins or in-app unlocks. Each pack contains a **real PSA-graded card**, randomly selected, delivered digitally, and stored physically. Once opened, you can: * Store it for free in PSA’s insured Delaware vault * Sell it instantly back to GameStop (at \\~90% of market value, minus a 6% commission) * List it on eBay directly * Ship it to your door (withdrawal fee applies) GameStop monetises this in three ways: pack sales, resale spread, and membership upgrades. This is loot-box mechanics wrapped around tangible goods. # The Hidden Edge The genius here isn’t in the product itself, it’s in how it reframes the customer’s psychology. Instead of buying a $30 PSA 8 card they actually want, users are spending $50 to *maybe* get something better. This is loot box economics dressed up in physical slabs. The irrational premium isn’t for the card, it’s for the experience of not knowing. GameStop isn’t just selling inventory, it’s monetising suspense. That dynamic lets them offload lower-tier cards at inflated implied value, while keeping margins fat and inventory moving. For collectors who want a specific card, there are cheaper paths. But those paths are boring. And GameStop is betting that, like casinos, most players aren’t looking to optimise, they’re looking to feel something. Of course, not everyone’s thrilled. Some early buyers complain about overpaying for bulk-tier slabs. But fo",

I’ve tried to be respectful but clearly this guy has no idea what the PSA Vault is. I thought everything was cleared up but now I’m getting more angry messages from this buyer weeks later.

          "text": "PSA Vault Review Pros and Cons !! Hello everyone, I know there was a post a couple months back on getting started using the vault, but I wanted to give my in depth review along with some big pros and cons that you may not be aware of if you arent an active user. I have most of my collection stored there and have been using it pretty much since it started up. Hope this helps some people. The Good: * One of their biggest selling points on the vault is being tax free, since it is located in DE. If you withdrawal early you will still have to pay a fee, but it is negligble compared to the taxes you would pay on high end cards. After 90 days of being vaulted you don't pay this fee. * You can receive cash offers from within their PSA network. Zero fees with immediate payment. The offers can range from laughable lowballs, but occassionaly you might get a really strong one at 90-100% market. For reference I have only accepted two offers this way. From what I understand the \"network\" is mostly businesses trying to obtain inventory, I am guessing they have to pay some sort of subscription/prove they are an actual business to join, but Idk. If someone here is part of it and has more insight would love to know. * You can change listings in real time. This market is changing faster than ever and extremely volatile. If you have sent a consignment with BIN pricing other places, that same price may not hold up by the time it is listed, not an issue with the vault. * You can ship directly from your vault to a private buyer. * For older Certs they will give you the high res scan if one dosent already exist. * Liability is not on you anymore. I know many of yall have sweated watching the tracking of something sent out, Ik I have. * They also provide really convenient data with recent solds, may not always be 100% up to date or accurate approximations of value, but can be helpful as a starting point in figuring out how to price. * The fees are cheaper than selling a card by yourself on ",

I’ve set up accounts on both the eBay site and PSA website using the same email address, but am now unsure of how to proceed. I don’t even know how to verify whether or not the accounts are genuinely linked at this point in time. There are a bunch of cards on the PSA eBay store account that I want to buy and have saved in the “PSA Vault”, so I’m confused as to why I still need to provide a shipping address when they should know just to save it in the vault and transfer titles to me? Or is the shipping address on the checkout page referring to the “shipping address” provided to me on the PSA website? Apologies if this is a noob question - just want to make sure my cards don’t end up halfway across the states or get lost in perpetuity somewhere in the back of the PSA headquarters",

          "text": "PSA lost vault card purchased on eBay. Reimbursement offered is under purchase price. EDIT: They are “now” reimbursing full value. TLDR: I bought a rare, low pop slab already in the vault from PSA on eBay for $830. PSA lost it en route to me when I “withdrew” it from the vault the same day. They are now only offering $500 due to comps in the form of a check or credits. Apparently my own comp of $830 is not sufficient. PSA can up charge us all day for card values and what not, yet when it’s time to payout for loss, they’re stingy. My problem with this is the disconnect between eBay and PSA in a short amount of time. I understand the two entities are separate and provide different services, but when they are so heavily advertised as being a seamless experience, it should be handled differently. To preface, I’ve sold AND bought dozens if not now over a hundred items back and forth to the vault and through eBay authentication. I’ve either bought/sold a slab directly in the vault, or had something shipped from the seller/myself to the vault to save on taxes. This is the first time I’ve ever had an issue. I understand that when something is held in the vault for a while, it may rise or diminish based on current comps, but when something was withdrawn from the vault on the same day of purchase from eBay, I think that should be handled differently. Had I purchased something shipped directly from a seller or even in the case of the authenticators, eBay would have reimbursed me the full amount, which I’ve already had happen before. In this case where the sale was initiated on eBay, but the loss was WITH PSA, I am screwed with a comp $330 less than my purchase price, and apparently my own comp is not sufficient.",

I won an auction for this card (a little over $100), seller being PSA and the card listed as being in the PSA vault. That was 2 weeks ago. I originally messaged because it had been like 4 days and never moved from paid to shipped, and they responded quickly and just said it has not been shipped but should arrive within the window of time. Now it is well past the window with no update (2 weeks). I have messaged 3 more times over this last week with no response. I opened a case with EBay that the item has not arrived. Funny thing is I won 2 other PSA auctions around the same time and both of those were processed and shipped normally. IDK if there is anything to be done at this point. EBay says they will step in on April 1. I’m guessing this ends with me just getting a refund but I want to know what BS is going on PSA / PSA Vaults end? Like did they lose this persons card and now can’t complete the sale and just went dark? Or does the original owner that had it in the vault have to OK the sale? I left negative feedback but obviously that is no real repercussion for them.",

How do I make sure that this vaulted item gets transferred to my vault without paying for shipping. I know eBay is doing auto payment after auctions now, but if I win an auction at 1am and I’m sleeping I won’t be able to manually go through the checkout process myself and choose the vault option. I do have my vault address saved in my eBay for other slab purchases that I want sent there instead of my home address. Do I need to set that address as my shipping after I bid? Thanks in advance!",

Should have researched that first which was stupid. In any case - my card is being shipped there, did I screw myself or is this something I can easily have re-shipped to my address? On ownership - will I have to prove to them I am the owner? It looked like sellers use it to store and re sell their cards, but the section on withdrawing a card you own was blank - and since I wasn't the person who shipped the card to begin with, I am just a bit nervous i screwed up. Anybody deal with this before / know what best course of action is? (I'll contact their support of course, I just read a lot of complaints about their CS so I wanted to post here as well in case I can get a quick answer for peace of mind)",

Ain’t no fucking way I’m writing a post like this from scratch, but I do think it’s a good pitch and should be considered. I’m here for good DD, if ai can help, why are we limiting ourselves from discussion? **TL;DR:** Collectors Holdings CEO sits on GameStop’s board for free. PE investors (including Steve Cohen’s family office) need an exit after 5 years. GameStop has $9B+ in cash. The same Steve Cohen who bailed out Melvin Capital in January 2021 may have no choice but to sell Ryan Cohen the dominant force in collectibles authentication. ----- ##The Board Seat That Doesn’t Make Sense (Unless It Does) In November 2024, GameStop appointed Nat Turner—Chairman and CEO of Collectors Holdings—to its Board of Directors. One month earlier, GameStop became an authorized PSA dealer. Ryan Cohen’s board is tight and hand-picked. You don’t get a seat for a dealer agreement. Turner receives no compensation for his board role. He’s the CEO of a company valued at $4.3 billion, sitting on GameStop’s board for free. **Why?** Because when this deal closes, he’ll be one of the largest GameStop shareholders. ----- ##What is Collectors Holdings? Collectors has quietly consolidated the entire collectibles authentication industry: |Brand |Category |Position | |-------|----------------------|-----------------------------| |PSA |Trading cards |#1 globally, 71% market share| |SGC |Trading cards |Acquired Feb 2024 | |Beckett|Trading cards & comics|Acquired Dec 2025 | |PCGS |Coins & currency |Industry leader | |WATA |Video games |Industry leader | |Goldin |Auction marketplace |Premium collectibles | According to GemRate, PSA graded 18.3+ million cards in 2025. **Combined with SGC and Beckett, Collectors now owns 79% of all card grading.** They don’t dominate the market.

I had my shipment from the vault held for pickuo at the fedex store and when i arrived, the worker at the counter said the bag that the box was in was opened, and so I said “okay well let me open this in front of you to make sure its actually in there” It was in fact not in there, the box was also opened, and the card removed. It absolutely had to have been a FedEx worker because i had it held for pickup, so no porch bandits today. Gutted really because the card in question was a miscut shadowless charmander without an MC label that I assume PSA only insured for it’s regular price. So likely I will get like $40 and never get to hold the card in person that I was over the moon about. The worst part is, there is absolutely nothing I could have done to prevent this. I have contacted FedEx and PSA and will see what happens. All I know is my day is ruined.",

If that’s accurate, please disregard the math below* *Still to me this supports the central point of the post:* ***Powerpacks are structured in a way that offers unusually strong value to customers***\\*, coming very close to break-even or only generating minimal profit for GameStop.\\* *Point of the post is only to address why GameStop would choose to release a product with such a small prospect of profit. They're selling 25$ worth of cards for 25$... And then some people will choose to sell them for 90%. They could have been greedier, but they weren’t.* *From my perspective, this looks more like a long‐term strategic move to encourage onboarding and adoption of digital ownership rather than a straightforward profit‐driven product. They want to have the best value proposition possible, even if it means breaking even. Think bigger than Powerpacks guys, that's just what I'm trying to say. A freaking global, digital marketplace!!!* *As for whether this qualifies as “gambling” or not... I couldn’t care less. Negative people can call it gambling if they want, but if it is, it’s a form of gambling where the house barely wins. Which remains unusually favorable to the customer.* *To the people saying \"chatGPT\": english isn't my first language so I use it for translation. Fuck you.* \\-------- I’ve been running the numbers on Powerpacks using the odds GameStop disclosed, and something stands out: **statistically, the expected value (mean return) of opening a pack is higher than the cost of the pack itself**. # $25 Powerpack |Range ($)|Probability (%)|Average Value ($)|Expected Gain ($)| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |5-15|36.0|10.0|3.60| |15-25|34.0|20.0|6.80| |25-50|22.0|37.5|8.25| |50-100|6.3|75.0|4.73| |100-200|1.5|150.0|2.25| |200-400|0.2|300.0|0.6",

Just been digging into Courtyard as a useful comparison with GameStop's new Power Packs/PSA launch. So by way of background, Courtyard (\\[dot\\] io - not sure if I can post a link to it here) is an existing collectibles platform which has been around for from what I can tell just over 7 months. Auctioning a [quarter of a million dollar Charizard](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/12/06/rare-250k-charizard-pokemon-card-going-on-auction-this-friday/) on their platform seems to have been their first big go at publicity from what I can tell and only this week they raised $30 million in a Series A funding round. Here's what they have to say about themselves on a job ad: >Courtyard is the fastest-growing collectibles startup, ever. We are revolutionizing the world of collectibles trading by enabling instant liquidity and delivering a high-velocity, immersive experience. From trading cards to comics, we’re redefining how people discover, collect, and unlock value. >Courtyard is not just another marketplace. All assets are securely vaulted and fully insured, giving collectors peace of mind alongside unmatched speed and simplicity. Whether you’re investing, discovering, or curating your dream collection, we’ve built a platform that’s trusted, simple, and built for speed. >And we’re just getting started. We’re a remote-first company hiring across all functions to push the boundaries of what’s possible in collectibles and digital ownership. Anyway, so like our new platform, they let their customers buy, sell, and trade physical trading cards, comics etc. through their online platform. And it’s growing fast. This year, transaction volume hit 95,000 per day, and in February alone they reported $42.6 million in sales volume. They’ve reported $9 million in revenue and raised $37.1 million total in funding, including the $30 million Series A round previously mentioned. Their model is",

I presented strong evidence that burgerchu was only being held up by shill bidding, and that when volume pressure (constant PSA vault auction lots of 200+ slabs at once) forced the shill bidders to stop, price would tank and not stop tanking. I had thought an initial floor of $100, but looking at future auctions there are only more and more huge lots coming. When the dust settles, I wonder how many people think that buying these en masse at ~$50 would be a better use of capital than other cards. The card does have a more interesting “story” behind it and will be memorable going into the future, but the signs were clear that buying at 200 or even 300-400+ like many did was a terrible move in the present.",

I didn't think much of it, as I just assumed they hadn't reloaded yet, and I didn't end up getting to play for that long anyways.

I then went to a card show in the Bay Area where PSA was having a drop off event. I vaulted around 400 slabs and went on with my life. Fast forward to today, I have Collectors emailing me saying that one of the cards was stolen so they can’t vault it. I show them the receipts, the dates, the invoice that connects to the certification proving that I paid for the card back in July, not knowing that it was a stolen card. Their response is in my photo. It actually makes me wonder if there’s a scam going on somewhere where people are selling their cards to GameStop and then saying it was stolen to pretty much get paid twice. I told the guy from Collectors when you go to trade in or sell something at GameStop they scan your ID and fingerprint you - at least in California. So ostensibly it should be pretty simple to find out who sold it at GameStop. Anyway, I’m not going to pay for the card twice, so at least they’ll ship it to me still.",

Long story short I’ve been trying to list this card on eBay via the vault. I thought it was a glitch so I tried on a few different days but it wouldn’t go. I reach out to the vault who within 12 hours respond saying that the card was damaged in shipping and I should talk to my mailman about the damage. I said no- my cards were checked for damage at the drop off event by PSA staff and shipped in to the vault by PSA themselves. The card doesn’t actually look damaged if you see the pics but if it is then they need to fix it, their shipping, their insurance. I waited a few days for a response but nothing came, I wrote in again and nothing. I calle customer service, the rep agreed with me and said they would try to get it expedited. Nothing. Original request to them was Jan 19, response Jan 20th. Now it’s Super Bowl Sunday and I have a PSA 10 rookie auto /10 of one of the team stars and I have no card, in hand or on eBay. Moral of the story, don’t use the vault- they have complete shit customer service and don’t use drop off events for vault shipping, because apparently PSA doesn’t know how to safely ship items.",

          "text": "Mastering the Collectibles Chain: GameStop’s Vertical Strategy I want to propose my two cents on what I think could be \"something that really has never been done before within the history of the capital markets\". This is what I'm titleing Mastering the Collectibles Chain: GameStop’s Strategy. I want to explore GameStop as a future integrated collectibles, custody, and financialization platform, sitting at the intersection of physical assets, digital ownership, valuation, insurance, and liquidity. The core idea is simple: GameStop dominates the entire collectibles value chain. It becomes the infrastructure layer for collectible value itself. It isn't just a retailer anymore. So GameStop shifts from retailer to asset platform. The recent move into graded collectibles and power packs looks like a gimmick, but they can be more of just products. Collectibles are financial assets. These components can be combined to create automated, transparent, and interoperable transactions, in case of GameStop, it becames the infrastructure itself. The important part is this: GameStop is no longer just selling inventory. It is redistributing value. Once a company does that, the next logical step is to own the system that defines, stores, insures, and revalues that value over time. Graded collectibles (PSA 8, 9, 10 etc.) already behave like semi-financial instruments. They have standardized grading, trade on secondary markets, have historical price data, sensitive to condition, scarcity, and demand, globally recognized. What they lack is institutional infrastructure. GameStop will acquire the necessary infrastructure. GameStop is uniquely positioned to collapse all of this into a single stack. The PSA is the keystone. If you control grading, you control authenticity, condition, market trust, value boundaries. GameStop does not need to immediately acquire PSA. A deep strategic partnership is enough at first. GameStop stores already are physical intake points, customers drop cards locall",

          "text": "A PSA on eBay/Collectr Sold Listing Dates and Prices for PSA Vaulted Cards **I was told to post here from people over on r/PokeInvesting since my post there wasn’t approved and since it’s broadly applicable to all PSA Vaulted listings.** I've recently seen a lot of posts asking about PSA Vaulted cards selling for way below market price on eBay. This is compounded by people on Collectr noticing sharp declines in graded card values, which has naturally led to a lot of speculation on what might be going on. If mods can pin this, that would be amazing, since I've seen so many posts about this issue. The bottom line is that **some PSA Vault listing sold dates are NOT ACCURATE**. For example, if you look at this [PSA 10 Venusaur EX](https://www.ebay.com/itm/306353002322?_skw=venusaur+ex+psa+10+151&epid=13062916148&itmmeta=01K7PPNFM55JFVR2A7KETZY2F6&hash=item47540fd752:g:3JUAAeSwzoRoTrfb) listing, you'll see that eBay is showing it as sold on October 15th at 05:04am. Notably, this card sold for $200 when the market price is currently $400. However, if you input the item number (**306353002322**) into [watchcount.com](http://watchcount.com) and navigate to the \"Item Purchase History\" link, you'll see that the card actually sold on [June 15th at 5:53:37pm PDT](https://www.ebay.com/bin/purchaseHistory/306353002322?mkevt=1&mkcid=1&mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&campid=5339074294&toolid=10001&customid=ZDk3NjllMjQtYjc2ZS00ZDE2LWI1MmYtNDFkYmIwZmI2YzFm).

          "text": "PSA Payment Processing Update Putting this post out there for some additional info I got from a customer service agent. As of right now all buy it now’s and auctions through PSAs vault program will be in payment processing until the item is shipped by PSA. And after shipped it will still be 5 business days till it reaches stripe. So at this point you’re at a 5-8 business day timeline for future or present sales besides the originals affected from the 13th-23rd. That’s until further notice. In terms of payment processing, cards have been payment processing since as early as the 13th of January and continue to do so atm. Speaking with him he stated that they are tackling this in a rolling basis and there is from what it sounds some sort of priority list as they make there way through. We know this being as some people as of this morning through today have seen first signs of payment processing going through and into stripe. Stripe on hold. Although some peoples payments have gone through we’ve seen countless people still state there PSA sales are still on hold in stripe, contacting stripe is worthless and they will always refer you back to PSA. The agent I spoke with game me a date of 2/6/2026 for estimated latest date on completion of stripe hold being listed. But I believe that could be individually given as this won’t be a widespread fix for all. Finally as we all still experiencing these issues I ask that for the good of the community that we utilize this post or any post further to congregate a comment section full of updates and what everyone is seeing to give info and piece of mind to those still affected. Thank you all for your time and I hope this is resolved soon.",

I redeemed a high-end card from Courtyard.io that was explicitly represented as being held in their vault. After the redemption was processed, I was informed the card could not be located. The only resolution offered was wallet credit based on their internal valuation, and covered shipping costs. This wasn’t just any card: • Jamaal Charles auto/patch 08/15, Low population and the only graded copy in existence, let alone a PSA 10 • It was effectively a 1/1 • Purchased as a long-term investment • My first redeemed card on the platform When a platform built on “secure vaulting” cannot produce a low population PSA 10, that’s not a minor operational issue — it’s a fundamental breakdown of trust and inventory integrity. At this point, it’s difficult to believe this card was ever actually in the vault or accurately represented at the time of sale. If a vaulted asset doesn’t exist when redeemed, then buyers are taking on risks they were never clearly informed about. I’m sharing this because this experience has ended my use of the platform, and I suspect it will for others once they understand what “vaulted” can really mean in practice. Do your own due diligence. Ask hard questions. Don’t assume safeguards exist just because they’re advertised.",

Note that these are not \"awaiting payment\" these are payment processing and have been stuck there for 13 days. PSA addressed this here : https://x.com/psacard/status/2016661921408201174?s=46 I've emailed them as well 3 times this week (no reply) It's kind of ridiculous- look if you want the cards, give me the money, or if you give me the money, you can have the card and do what you want with it. But as it stands right now, they have the card and are shipping to the buyer, but they also have my money and i have nothing. end rant",

I looked it up and it says that the buyer has to pay within 7 days or it can be re-listed but it’s already been longer than 7 days. Something makes me think this is something on PSAs end not updating their orders or the app but I’m not sure. Anyone run into this issue before?

It's about getting cards into my PSA Vault under the following scenarios: 1) If I buy a slab from PSA through their ebay storefront/postings, how do I make sure the card goes to my PSA Vault rather than shipped home? Do I simply make the shipping address the same as my PSA Vault address or is there like a button/option you select before you win the auction to note that you want it to go to your PSA Vault? 2) If I buy a slab from a random eBay seller, is it possible for the card to go straight to my PSA Vault rather than having it shipped home and then me having to ship it to my PSA Vault? Do I simply make my shipping address on eBay the same as my PSA Vault address? Thanks for any help you all can provide!",

After the sale, I was informed that I cannot receive the payment unless I have a Stripe account. As far as I understand, Stripe payouts are not available in my country. Why is Stripe the only payout option? It feels outdated and extremely restrictive for international users. If I had known that Stripe was required, I would never have accepted the offer or sold the card in the first place. PSA says this is their policy, but allowing international sellers to complete transactions without a valid payout method makes no sense. This is a serious issue, especially for higher-value cards.

Hybrid Grading Approach finally moves on by being acquired by [ucollect](https://ucollect.com/) A long announcement in the \"restructuring\" area of the HGA website appeared to be bullish and optimistic about a restart in mid-2026. **But do ucollect/HGA have any moats? (** In business, a **moat** refers to a **sustainable competitive advantage** that protects a company from competitors, enabling it to maintain market share, pricing power, and profitability over time. Like a medieval moat defending a castle, it makes the business difficult to attack or replicate.) In short: I don't think they have any moats, but they talk a big game even though Collectibles and Fanatics are in the room What they do *have*: * Convenience via vertical integration (grade → list → sell in one place) * Lower fees (for now) * Nice-looking slabs and sub-grades * A collector-friendly philosophy Why those aren’t moats (yet): * Vertical integration = convenience, not defensibility. PSA + eBay already functionally replicate this. * Low fees aren’t a moat unless you have massive scale (they don’t). Incumbents can always undercut temporarily. * Strict grading isn’t rewarded by the market without resale premiums and trust. * Slabs, labels, and holders are cosmetic — collectors crack them if liquidity isn’t there. * Direct buyer–seller communication actually *weakens* platform defensibility long-term. * Early “in-house” inventory isn’t real liquidity. What *is* a real moat in this hobby: * Brand trust * Registry lock-in * Price-setting power * Institutional adoption * Deep liquidity PSA (via Collectors) has all of those but ucollect/HGA has none yet. The *only* moat ucollect could realistically build: * Inventory inertia + workflow lock-in (vaulted cards trading repeatedly without leaving the ecosystem) But that requires: * Time * Capital * Volume * Survival and we already know that vaulted cards only works for very expensive cards hich also means ",

          "text": "Imagine a GameStop Kiosk That Instantly Grades Cards What if GameStop partnered even deeper with PSA and built AI powered grading kiosks directly in stores? You walk in, insert your Pokémon, MTG, or sports card into a secure machine, and within minutes it’s scanned, graded by AI, slabbed in store, and added to your GameStop wallet on the blockchain! No mailing. No waiting weeks. No worrying about damage or fakes. No middlemen. Think about what that unlocks: * Instant grading using high-res imaging and machine learning to assess centering, corners, edges, and surface * Secure encapsulation (slabbed right in front of you) * Real-time blockchain registration - card is in your account and verified on-chain * You could trade, sell, or vault it the same day through GameStop's marketplace or wallet This solves multiple pain points in the collectibles space: 1. Grading delays and shipping risk 2. Trust and transparency in card condition 3. Difficulty onboarding casual collectors into the ecosystem It’s also a massive opportunity for GameStop: * Increased physical foot traffic from a new customer segment * Recurring kiosk revenue (grading fees, encapsulation, etc.) * Onboarding costumers into their Web3 wallet ecosystem through a real, tangible asset not speculative JPEGs * Tying all of this into a collectible trading platform would instantly set them apart from eBay and Whatnot No, they aren’t doing this yet. But the pieces are there: * GameStop already partnered with PSA * They’ve built blockchain rails and a wallet which they could easily bring back * They’re sitting on thousands of stores that could house these kiosks * And the collectibles market is still red hot, especially among younger collectors People are still sleeping on how big the trading card market is, and how broken the grading experience still is in 2025. Whoever solves it in a streamlined, tech-forward way is going to own the space. GameStop could literally be first to do it at scale. Just imagine: AI grad",

I think I spent like 1.5k on completing it (that’s including the LR++ cards being the most expensive). So what I’m asking here is if I just buy the 12 box case of the new Steel Requiem, which is around 1.5k, what are the chances that I complete the whole set with just that 1 purchase?

          "text": "Edit: I genuinely hope this post and the comments can help people learn and improve the marketplace for everyone, everything I know about this business I learned because other sellers were willing to teach me and share their knowledge, and I hope that continues to happen! I remember 5 years ago when I started my business on Ebay and Tcgplayer and I was hand writing addresses on envelopes. Almost immediately, I realized this was a mistake. Today I received an order in one of those tiny envelopes that barely fit a toploader, 2 weeks past the estimated arrival date, no packing slip and with a handwritten address that I could barely read and the WRONG CARD VERSION INCLUDED IN THE ORDER, with the correct version having doubled in price. I went to see if this was a brand new seller coming in from FF, and was going to give them a break considering they were brand new. BUT NO, this sellers has over THREE THOUSAND ORDERS confirmed. All of this to say, I ship as professionally as anyone possibly could, packing slip, proper cards and all, and I still get the occasional complaint. I have no idea how sellers like this make it this far without hundreds of complaints, and this hot market and final fantasy bringing in tons of new buyers and sellers isn't helping at all. I'm proud of the quality of service my business provides, but I'm getting sick of the childish sellers making my business and other good businesses look bad by association. I hope this is financially related enough to stay, I know the mods have been working overtime, and to relate it to MTGFinance more I will pose the question: What do you expect from a seller in the TCG marketplace? How much service is just enough? Do you appreciate when sellers go the extra mile with the way they package and ship or do you just want the cheapest fastest way? What does it take for a seller to get a negative review from you? Thanks for reading my rant everyone. Big Z out.",
