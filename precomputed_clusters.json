          "text": "NEED HELP PLEASE READ To make a long story short I collected cards and was aggressively into the hobby from around ages 8-16ish. I’m now 23 and wanted to jump back u into my old hobby I loved so much. I decided to kick it off with a bang and ordered a jumbo hobby box. As you can see I pulled these two bad boys. From the comps it looks like the Burns is a 450-500ish dollar card with the Teel being 50-100. I wanna sell them to start building back up my old Red Sox Pc. I just moved to Charlotte and there is a card show next weekend of the 28th. Do I bring it there or hit up the LCS trying to strike while it is hot and before comps go down. The reason I’m not really considering eBay is i have never sold anything on eBay before(and admittedly don’t really know how to) and don’t don’t know if people will buy these cards from a seller with no reviews. Please help me get the best bang for my buck",

For the last couple of years I haven’t been able to find sealed product at retail stores or online, I even signed up for website alerts for when Costco, target, Best Buy has them on sale but they get eaten up in seconds. I am starting to give up, and hate to support scalpers, but I also don’t want to be pushed out of the market waiting on the sideline. I’m definitely not going to camp out at stores and follow distributors like parasites waiting to pounce on every single stocked product, I just want a couple booster boxes from each set and hold until my kids are older, and done to hold for even longer since I loved growing up with Pokemon as a kid. I am considering buying at current market prices from sites like loose packs or highly rated ebay sellers, just wondering if other people share the same sentiment and moved to this unfortunate position.",

(Credit: Bonham's) By Will Stern — January 27, 2026 Share An original Bob Ross painting, created during an episode of the television show “The Joy of Painting” in 1990, sold for $787,900 at Bonham’s on Tuesday. The sale is the most recent in a series of rapidly rising auction prices for pieces painted by Ross, most recently seen in the million-dollar sale conducted by John Oliver’s “Last Week Tonight.” Bonham's conducted the sale on behalf of American Public Television, which has pledged to direct 100% of net proceeds to support public television stations nationwide. Titled “Change of Seasons,” the painting was composed during episode 11 of the show's 20th season and signed in the bottom left corner by Ross. He described the work in the episode as \"just a beautiful little painting\" and it has remained in storage since its creation in 1990. Prior to the Oliver sale, the record for a Ross painting was less than $318,000, set in late 2025. Want more stories like this? Subscribe to the cllct newsletter and follow cllct on X and Instagram .

SCP Auctions sold a match-used racket from Novak Djokovic's thrilling 2012 Australian Open title run for $540,000, breaking the record for any game-used racket by more than $350,000. The final of that tournament is widely considered one of the best matches in history, if not the best. No. 1-seeded Djokovic bested No. 2-seeded Rafael Nadal in the longest Grand Slam final ever, lasting five hours and 53 minutes. It also remains the longest match in Australian Open history. The win also marked the second consecutive Grand Slam final in which Djokovic beat Nadal, having defeated the Spaniard just a few months earlier in the U.S. Open. \"It was obvious on the court ... that both of us, physically, we took the last drop of energy that we had from our bodies,\" Djokovic said in his trophy presentation. \"We made history tonight, and unfortunately there couldn’t be two winners.” The two share what is quite possibly the greatest rivalry in the sport's history, having played 60 times, 10 more than any other men's pair. Djokovic won the all-time series 31-29. The two most recently played in the 2024 Olympics. This racket is accompanied by a complete photo-match from Resolution Photomatching, which additionally matched it to Djokovic's quarterfinal win against David Ferrer and semifinal victory ",

As an autograph collector, Capobianco had long tried to get a signature from Robert Redford, the award-winning actor who died Tuesday at the age of 89. \"He was the white whale,\" Capobianco told cllct of his quest to land an autograph from the legendary actor, filmmaker and environmental activist. \"It's not even (solely) for the value, because there are other signatures more valuable. But for the challenge, all of us wanted him in our collection.\" Capobianco had gotten close to Redford, but like many others, he had failed to land the Oscar winner's signature. After being rebuffed at UMass-Lowell, where Redford had been interviewed on-stage at an event called the Middlesex County College Forum, Capobianco learned Redford was headed to New York on a certain flight. The collector said he bought a first-class seat and sat down next to the star. \"It was a very short flight,\" Capobianco said. \"As the plane started to descend, I said, 'Mr. Redford, I travel with a baseball just in case I meet anyone famous, would you sign this for me?'\" Redford, Capobianco recalled, reached out his hand, took the baseball, signed it and then handed it back to Capobianco without saying a word. \"He wasn't happ",

(Credit: Getty Images) By Kevin Jackson — July 28, 2025 Share I can’t remember the first autograph I ever got from an athlete. But I can vividly recall the first signature that truly meant something to me. On an unseasonably gray morning on the last day of July in 1985, I walked into Wrigley Field for the first time. My best friend, Tim Thatcher, had convinced his parents to let me tag along on a family trip to the Midwest, which would include seeing baseball games in Chicago, Cleveland and Cincinnati. While we were excited about watching the Yankees at the “Mistake by the Lake” and Pete Rose was in pursuit of Ty Cobb’s career hits record in Cincy, the clear highlight of the entire trip was going to be the afternoon at the Friendly Confines. Kevin Jackson, left, and Tim Thatcher revisited Wrigley Field two decades after their first trip in 1985. (cllct photo by Kevin Jackson) I remember praying the night before that the rain would hold off long enough for the Cardinals and Cubs to play the game scheduled for 1:20 p.m. And if they couldn’t get in all nine innings, we at least hoped they’d open the park for a couple of 15-year-old fans to roam the bleachers. The rains held off just enough, and we were lined at the intersection under the famous marquee at the intersection of Clark and Addison an hour before the gates opened. While we waited, Tim’s mom wandered ",

(Photos courtesy of Andrew Goldberg) By Darren Rovell — January 04, 2026 Share Andrew Goldberg isn't done yet, but he has some sense of accomplishment after acquiring two NBA playoff tickets last week. In 2015, the native Chicagoan decided to seek to collect every ticket from the famous 1995-96 season when the Bulls won 72 games. \"I was spending so much time on it, and saw how much was out there, that I just figured, why not do it all?\" said Goldberg, the 52-year-old executive director of the Memphis Ballet. And with that, he decided to collect every NBA regular-season, postseason and All-Star Game that Jordan played in, a total of 1,264 games. \"I've always been collecting things, whether it be comic books or baseball cards,\" Goldberg said. \"I've never particularly been any good at it.\" Goldberg now stands 136 tickets away, but he has finished the playoff set, thanks to recently getting a 1986 game against the Boston Celtics and a 1988 contest against the Detroit Pistons. Michael Jordan's 63-point playoff game in 1986 was one of Goldberg's last missing postseason tickets. (Photo courtesy of Andrew Goldberg) The 1986 game was the record-setting game when MJ set the NBA playoff record with 63 points in the Boston Garden. After the game, Larry Bird told reporters the performance was \"God disguised as Michael Jordan.\" Goldberg had held out because of the price of the record-setting ",

(Credit: Getty/eBay) By Kevin Jackson — December 08, 2025 Share Growing up in Vadalia, Georgia, Will Driggers was about as far away from Seattle as you can get without leaving the United States — but that didn't stop him from becoming a huge fan of Ken Griffey Jr. \"Every summer morning, you wake up and you put on ESPN, and it's Ken Griffey Jr., Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa,\" Driggers, 39, said. \"I already had friends who were Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa collectors, so I figured I'd be Griffey. ... \"He was kind of my guy from then on.\" That fandom turned into a serious collecting addiction — and Driggers can recall the exact moment when his Griffey bug really became contagious. \"How I got hooked on baseball cards was I bought a pack of 1989 Upper Deck when they were like $7 a pack in 1998,\" Driggers recalled. \"I pulled two Griffey No. 1s out of one pack. At that point, I think they were about $150 raw, and so when you're 11 or 12 years old in 1998, that's 300 bucks, man. That's huge money.\" Driggers found himself amassing a vast collection of Griffey Jr. cards and tickets, striving to get every one of the Mariners star's key rookie cards in the highest grades. \"Not to be like braggadocious or anything like that, but I would say I probably have one of the top two or three Griffey rookie card collections in the world,\" he said.

(Photo courtesy of David Blixt) By Will Stern — December 07, 2025 Share For David Blixt’s 13th birthday in 1984, his parents got him tickets to see Michael Jordan. As the former North Carolina star prepared for his NBA debut, the hype around the Bulls' top draft pick was palpable. The man who would later become known as “His Airness” was coming to play a preseason game just down the block from Blixt’s family’s home at Washington High School in East Chicago, Indiana. “You’re having true Chicago fans for the first time being able to really see him in proximity to Chicago,” Blixt explained of that preseason game. Jordan wasn’t the only big name attracting fans to the game. Initially, marketing of the exhibition match surrounded Junior Bridgeman, who was from East Chicago and would be making a homecoming. However, the Bucks traded Bridgeman to the Clippers just two weeks prior to the game. Bridgeman, who died earlier this year, would go on to become an incredibly successful entrepreneur following his NBA career, accumulating a net worth in excess of $1 billion. “Two future billionaires,” Blixt noted of the irony of the two men’s paths nearly crossing that day in Indiana. The ticket features the names “Jr. Bridgeman” and “Michael Jordan” in parentheses under their respective teams. Blixt, who had never been to a Bulls game, recalled the preseason game as one of the most special memories from his childhood, attending with his sister, father and mother",

But there's zero doubt he's the MVP to the kids at Golisano Children’s Hospital in Buffalo, New York. All this season, the Buffalo Bills quarterback has worn custom New Era hats to each home game that were designed by a different patient at Golisano, which was formerly called Oishei Children's Hospital before a Jan. 1 name change. This is so incredible from @JoshAllenQB and @NewEraCap ❤️???? \"My job's not that hard. I play football. What you guys have to go through and continue to fight through is much harder than I do.

All proceeds from each sale then go to the Patricia Allen Fund (named after Allen's grandmother) to benefit critical care teams at Golisano. After nine home games and subsequent auctions this season, $139,095 was raised for the critical care units serving Western New York's children and families. The week-by-week breakdown is as follows: Week 18: Morgan’s cap - $30,100 Week 17: Nico’s cap - $16,050 Week 14: Ruby’s cap - $20,000 Week 11: Max & Ben’s cap - $14,100 Week 9: Carson’s cap - $13,550 Week 5: Bryn’s cap - $9,050 Week 4: Charlie’s cap",

The Miami Dolphins linebacker wanted to give personalized high school jerseys to the entire team. When Walker went to Anthony Castro, the founder and CEO of All Stars Miami , a company which customizes high school jerseys, Castro just requested Walker give him the 53-man active roster. But Walker didn’t want jerseys for just the active roster. He wanted them for everyone on the practice squad, and he wanted them for coaches. “You sure?” Walker remembered Castro asking. “Absolutely.\" Walker Jr. wanted to go above and beyond with gifts for his Dolphins teammates. (Credit: Getty Images) On Dec. 14, when Walker presented replica jerseys to each of his teammates for Christmas, the reaction in the locker room was exactly what he and Castro had hoped for — but the national reception was even more overwhelming. The video, which the Dolphins posted to their social media channels, has been shared around the country and shown to millions, with unanimous praise. “He really deserves the love that he's getting,” Castro said. “He really went above and beyond.” But this was never supposed to be a holiday gift. Walker, a 29-year-old Miami native, signed with the Dolphins this past offseason. His home, though, is in Dallas. With little time to go back to",

The price is a record for any Flagg-related collectible and comes mid-way through his rookie campaign, during which he is averaging 20.4 points, 6.5 rebounds and 4.1 assists for the Dallas Mavericks. \"The $1 million result for Cooper Flagg’s rookie debut jersey is a powerful testament to the significance collectors place on true ‘first moments’ in sport,\" Brahm Wachter, Sotheby’s Head of Modern Collectibles, said in a statement. \"This jersey captures the very beginning of a special career, one carrying huge expectations and excitement.” Flagg's Summer League debut jersey sold in August for $95,250 in a Sotheby's auction. Sotheby's is the NBA's official game-worn partner, and generally offers jerseys from key games in public auctions, such as the 2023 sale of Victor Wembanyama's debut jersey for $762,000. However, the auction house has recently become more strategic with its inventory, holding back jerseys that have the potential to gain in value. Collectors will have the chance to scoop up other key rookie debut jerseys at auction this month, however, as Sotheby's will sell gamers from the first games of VJ Edgecombe, Kon Knueppel, Dylan Harper, Derik Queen and more, with bidding opening Thursday.

In addition to a new Upper Deck Authenticated memorabilia collection highlighting her career, Korda will also appear on a Young Guns trading card as part of 2026 Upper Deck Golf. “Upper Deck has a long history of working with world-class athletes like Nelly who transcend their sport and become cultural icons,” said Jason Masherah, President of Upper Deck, in a statement. “She can bring new collectors to the hobby, and in turn we’ll deliver the Upper Deck standard: premium trading cards and memorabilia that reflect Nelly as a one-of-a-kind athlete.” Currently, Korda’s most valuable card is her 2020 S.I. For Kids, which has sold for as much as $1,000. “I’ve seen firsthand the passion and joy that collecting brings to so many people, and the way that Upper Deck honors that passion and creates memorable experiences for collectors and fans. I’m excited to collaborate with Upper Deck and engage with the community,",

The first robe comes from the 1975 “Thrilla in Manila” fight and was worn by Frazier as he entered the ring. The robe sold in 2008 for $40,000 and now has an estimate of $125,000-$150,000 with a starting bid of $75,000. The second robe was worn at the weigh-in for “The Fight of the Century” in 1971 at Madison Square Garden. Frazier would go on to win the fight in 15 rounds, marking the first professional loss of Ali’s career. The robe sold for $20,000 in 2008 and now has an estimate of $100,000-$120,000 with a starting bid of $50,000. Bidding on both lots closes on Feb. 25.",

Rovell: Topps' top 75 list was good, not great Where did Topps go right? Where did it go wrong? From error cards to the best of the best, Topps ranked their top 75 cards By Darren Rovell — February 12, 2026 Share In celebration of its 75th anniversary of making Topps baseball cards, Topps unveiled what it felt was the top 75 baseball cards in its history. After seeing the list, I brought in Simeon Lipman, an awesome collector who some of you know from \"Antique Roadshow\" to discuss. And like any list, we thought there were some good calls and some bad ones. The 1952 Topps Mantle is definitely No. 1, but both of us felt the 1952 Willie Mays was high at No. 2. The Paul Skenes Debut patch and the 2018 Topps Update Shohei Ohtani Rookie Debut are important cards, but we also both felt that they should be outside the Top 10. The most egregious one in the top 10 to us seemed to be the 1986 Topps Traded Barry Bonds. It's just the wrong Bonds card. While it wasn't the rookie and certainly less valuable, the Bonds card that defined Topps baseball was the wood borders of the 1987 set and the skinny full-bodied Bonds was more important. The list also put Jose Canseco's 1986 Topps Traded Card. Again, it was rarer, but there's virtually no argument that it was a bigger card to collectors than the gold cup All-Rookie Team card. Simeon's biggest card missing was the 1979 Ozzie Smith rookie. How in the heck did they miss that? That was followed by the 1985 Dwight Gooden card. We are both New York boys but nationwide, that beats the Clemens, which made the list. Putting the 1985 Kirby Puckett card on the list was even stranger. Speaking of Mets, to put Gregg Jefferies 1989 Future Star card on this list is completely disengenuous. No one cared about that card because Topps got beat by Fleer to feature Jefferies ",

Maye has been the most popular athlete among card collectors for the last six months Maye led the Patriots to the Super Bowl in his first full season as a starter (Credit: Getty) By Matt Liberman — February 11, 2026 Share Drake Maye's first Super Bowl appearance certainly didn't go how many expected. He was running for his life all game, being sacked seven times and he turned the football over three times as well. Even the 29-13 final score makes the game seem much closer than it actually was. Still, despite the crushing loss, Maye Mania is very real in the hobby and appears to be here to stay. If you look at GemRate's 50 most-graded athletes of all time, which the company released in January, the top 10 produces names you'd probably expect. Michael Jordan, Ken Griffey Jr., Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Tom Brady, etc. There are really only two modern-day unicorns in the top heap, Shohei Ohtani and Victor Wembanyama. And while Maye doesn't really have a chance of affirming himself in that list among graded cards - this was only his first full season as a starter - he is on par with, if not ahead of nearly everyone else in other metrics since the football season began. Not even \"His Airness\" Michael Jordan had as many card sales over the previous 180 days. Maye leads all athletes with 159.9 sales, more than 10,000 more than MJ and over 50,000 more than anyone else. And if you extend the time frame to a full year, he still trails only Jordan, sitting more than 35,000 cards above third-place Jayden Daniels. Perhaps what is even crazier though, to show just how robust Maye's market became, is the total amount of money spent on Maye's cards. Maye sits third on the leaderboard over the last 90 days, trailing just Jord",

Cooper ransom money more mysterious than the escape itself On this date in 1980, $5,800 of D.B. Cooper ransom money was discovered Only $5,800 of $200,000 in ransom money was discovered (Credit: Getty) By Darren Rovell — February 11, 2026 Share There are a handful of people and stories that never get out of my head. They are, in order of my fascination: The JFK Assassination, D.B. Cooper, the sinking of the Titanic and the 1962 Alcatraz Escape. All of these have one thing in common: How the hell did they ever happen? JFK is pretty self-explanatory. It's such a deep rabbit hole, because, well, the truth is likely more complicated than we will ever know. The Titanic's makers tempted fate by calling the boat \"Unsinkable.\" But how an iceberg wasn't seen because of a combination of hubris and a missing key to a binoculars case is astounding. The 1962 escape from Alcatraz, was led by Frank Lee Morris, a prisoner with a 133 IQ. Not only did they escape from the inescapable, but substantive remnants of their escape, for the most part, were never found in the water. There's one element of D.B. Cooper has than none of the others have. There was an encore. From November 1971 through January 1980, the only unsolved American hijacking wasn't all that well known nationwide. But when an 8-year-old boy named Brian Ingram came across $5,800 in $20 bills that matched the FBI dossier from the Cooper ransom list, the legend expanded its reach. It also made no sense, which added to the mystery. Ingram found the bills bundled together in a Columbia River beach called Tena Bar. Except Tena Bar wasn't close to the FBI flight path, so, either the flight path was wrong or the money would have had to flow down smaller rivers into the Columbia. But how ",

Collectibles.com and cllct partnered to find the most passionate collectors for the two Super Bowl LX teams Old-school QB collectibles set these two winners apart (Credit: Getty, Collectibles.com) By Darren Rovell — February 07, 2026 Share When we announced the Super Bowl contest to find the best New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks collection on Collectibles.com, I honestly didn't know what we would find. There were plenty of cards submitted, but nothing really stood out. There were collections of autographed jerseys — primarily Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski — but they were ones that you could easily buy at any moment. What I did fall in love with is the real 1/1 of stuff. The pieces which proved these collectors were real fans through and through. Now I'm not saying that real fans have to have a 20-year history, but the fact that our two winners clearly had that made them stand out. Not only did these guys have these items, but they uploaded them with pride to Collectibles.com for the world to see. Our Seahawks winner is David Ellis. You can check out his collection here . Sure, there's the great game-used jerseys — a 1999 Christian Fauria, a 2001 Brock Huard, a Cortez Kennedy and team-issued Steve Largent. But the one that stood out for me was a team-issued 1991 Dan McGwire. All us kids of the 1990s knew about Mark McGwire's baby brother, who wasn't exactly a baby (6-foot-8). The Seahawks drafted him 16th overall in 1991, 17 picks before a guy named Brett Favre. What makes this jersey great is McGwire, unlike his brother, was a bust and McGwire only played one game in that rookie 1991 ",

(Credit: Getty) By Will Stern — February 05, 2026 Share When the time came for “The Great One” to hang up his skates in 1999, he was well-aware of the value of his jerseys. That’s why Wayne Gretzky wore four jerseys for his final game for the Rangers — one in warm-ups and one for each period. The jersey Gretzky wore pre-game and for the first period is now on the auction block at Classic Auctions, with bidding currently sitting just below $100,000. Another jersey from the game sold for $715,120 in 2023. His final jersey from the third period of the game now sits in the Hall of Fame.

Yes, I realize the Macklin is a hot card, but it doesn’t make up for an irreplaceable item. I did my part and shipped back the Macklin Celebrini rookie card I received when they asked me to. Whoever received my printing plate booklet in the mixup must have decided to keep it. I would ask if that’s you, and you’re reading this, please consider doing the right thing and reaching out to me.

Because I eventually want to move to higher ticket items, it's completely reasonable to expect inventory movement to slow down as a result. But my trouble here is how I should handle \"rare\" items like some antique or vintage item that has little to no sold price history. Do I just do what some people do and price it at some arbitrary high price, then gradually lower the price to get more views and eventually a bite? Or, and I haven't seen this suggested anywhere, do I try having it appraised by some professional? From a quick google search, this can range from $50 to $500, which ultimately poses a risk, since, after appraisal, I might already be at a loss, since I now have to account for the appraisal cost when I list the item. What do I do here?",

          "text": "Five best looking Special Illustration Rares in Ascended Heroes Ascended Heroes is the newest Pokemon set to hit shelves and the most unique thing about it is the number of Special Illustration Rares in the set. Coming in at a total of 22 SIRs, that makes for the highest number of SIRs we’ve seen in a set in the, albeit brief, Mega Evolutions era. In fact, Mega Evolution and Phantasmal Flames have a combined total of 15 SIRs, making Ascended Heroes a particularly great set to chase them. The sheer number of SIRs also makes for a fun opportunity for me, as I typically focus on a set’s Illustration Rares because the quantity of SIRs doesn’t typically allow for a ranking with any kind of selection. Ascended Heroes deviates from that trend and it is incredibly exciting to see such a wide scope of premium hits. Fezandipiti ex Fezandipiti isn’t one of my favorite Pokemon, and that would likely be the common sentiment among most fans. Of the Loyal Three of Fezandipiti, Okidogi, and Munkidori, Fezandipiti is the one I am most drawn to, and all three of them do have some really nice arts. This Fezandipit is the best among them, taking a bit of inspiration from the Munkidori Illustration Rare from Shrouded Fable. The influx of pink color brought by both Fezandipiti itself and the cherry blossom tree complement each other well, making for an overall beautiful piece of artwork. Mega Frosslass ex Froslass is inspired by Japanese folklore of a spirit haunting the woods waiting for weary travelers to wander through and this Mega Froslass ex SIR encompasses that piece of folklore. The way it stands between the trees, with an enticing, yet sinister, look makes you know the fate of the traveler that finds this Pokemon. Snow aesthetic is always going to get bonus points for me as it is. Mega Gengar ex Mega Gengar is one of the coolest megas solely based on the fact of how terrifying it is. For as haunting as regular Gengar is supposed to be, there is something usually comedic about it",

          "text": "Need help pricing Meyer China and Wallace Silver collection My mother bought these dishes from an antique store in the early 1980s. It's an amazing set from a hotel in La Grande, Oregon circa 1925. We're located here in the Pacific NW and the only local antique dealer interested in the set is asking us to name a price. I have no idea if I should be asking $200 or $2000 for it. They include 46 Meyer China pieces, 10 R Wallace silver soldered pieces, and 7 glassware pieces. All are in near-pristine condition. More information on the history of this china and the hotel can be found at [https://rwcn-idwiki-2.restaurantwarecollectors.com/content/la-grande-hotel/](https://rwcn-idwiki-2.restaurantwarecollectors.com/content/la-grande-hotel/) What's a reasonable price?

I've been breaking them down to in piles as followed based on price charting scans and recent sales/ averages ¢1-¢30 ¢31-¢65 ¢66-$1 $1.01-1.50 $1.51-$2.25 $2.26-$3 $4+ Here is where I need more directions. What's everyone's opinion on selling the stacks. Should I open the trick or trick pack of 40 packs. How should I structure lots for under 2 dollars and where is better eBay mercari tcg? Do I need to break down the bulk piles into there respective sets (x and y evolutions or team up) I really appreciate all insight.

The price on eBay for collection and drop off is the same price, £2.75. For months I've booking one collection, and handing over any extras to be scanned which were bought as drop off (again same price) so as not to have to have extra collections booked when they're already booked to collect. I also pack a lot of orders late at night, meaning that if I did book collections for the extra orders that come through late at night, they'd have to then be collected the day after the original collection day. I asked my usual postie if its okay to book one collection and hand over the extras to be scanned when he comes to collect in the morning, and he said it was fine. Done this for months. Today a different employee came to collect (they had manager written on their uniform), and stated that each collection costs 30p per parcel (which is the case if booked direct via RM), and they would \"let me off for today\". Am I in the wrong? For eBay this doesn't make any sense to me, being as the price of drop off and collection is the exact same. Happy to be corrected!",

To those who tried rage baiting or telling me it's a pointless post, might be pointless to you - but there's plenty of others who clearly wanted this to be said. Your rage bait attempts were also pathetic - gotta work a bit harder because unlike you rats, I have thick skin and can handle a bit of abuse without having a sook and reporting you to the admins. I've been speaking privately to Alex about this - and after our conversation, I can admit that my anger towards this group was misdirected towards him. The WTB post, now that I think about it clearly, had no reason to be in the original post - so I have now removed it. I guess I was just finding anything I could to put the admin team down, and I saw the listing (which was directly related to the origin of this post) and pulled the trigger. I won't speak to what he said to me - but I wanted to update you all on the fact that Alex has come to me and asked how he and the group can \\*help with this situation. There is a solution in the works - however reselling will never be banned. As much as I don't like the idea of them (scalpers) having a platform this big to sell on, I've done as much as I can and that's just the way it is. I want to thank Alex for fronting up to the comments below and my messages (I was fairly direct about his admin team's behaviour) as you copped the full front of everything instead of Rhys - the one who SHOULD be responding. \\*help - not completely resolve as the resolution we want is for reselling to be banned, and that's not going to happen. Rhys - after looking at all these comments and seeing all the people you've pissed off and how you've clearly chosen what people to defend in different situations, I think it's time for you to mak",

Location: Texas Hey everyone, recently I was talking with a guy on instagram about trading some of my pokemon cards for some of his sealed pokemon product, we agreed on the trade and I asked him to open it and just ship me the packs inside. He agreed and said I had to ship all my cards to him first and once he verified that received the stuff I sent was correct he would ship out his end of the trade. I was fine with that so I agreed but later my parents found out about the trade and made be block him on all platforms as they believed that he was going to scam me as I have been scammed like this before and the trade value was above $2000. He then messages me on my ebay store threatening me to unblock him or else there will be consequences so I block him again as I do not want to deal with someone who has to resort to threats. He then makes a new ebay account and messaged me today with screenshots that he messaged one of my friends on instagram about me and with screenshots of my linkedin profile threatening to call my job and the local police if I don't compensate him for opening his pokemon box. I offered him to pay him the difference in price of the box sealed vs opened but he only wants the full amount for the boxes which is $800 even though the packs inside are still sealed. My reasoning was that he shouldn't have opened the box in the first place as he didn't even recieve the cards that I would have sent him yet. Shouldn't he have confirmed that I sent him the correct stuff in the trade before opening his product since I was supposed to ship to him first anyway? He says he will file a police report by the end of the week and I do not know what to do please help.",

As a collector who has been in the hobby for a year, I have learned quite a bit, but I still have much more learning to do. I’m sure the question above will help others like me who are slowly getting into the hobby. I have a local card shop in my area that has very reasonable prices for the sports that I collect, which is football (soccer), European basketball, and baseball. They do an amazing job of getting any hobby box that I request if they are able. This year I have been able to pick up topps finest, multiple topps chrome products, and really any baseball product I would like. I typically prefer to buy hobby boxes over blasters/retail and I am slowly getting into buying singles on EBay and at local card shows. I really enjoy being a wax ripping degenerate and I even protect a lot of my base cards even though I know boxes are -EV long term. There is one thing I have noticed, sometimes my LCS prices hobby boxes higher than what I can find online from retailers like Dave and Adam’s and Blowout Cards. For example, I want a box of 2024-25 Topps Chrome UEFA Club Competitions Soccer Hobby Box. My LCS is selling it for $225. Wax Stat has the average box price $239.95, and then there is another site that I saw a box for $200. Let me say this, I know that shops are really able to price their products however the hell they want and they probably get products at MSRP. My LCS is not budging on his price with me and I fear his 15 boxes will sit on the shelf for a long time. As a consumer, I’m a little bit of a penny pincher and I want to make sure I’m not overpaying for the same product. Is there any tips that long term collector can give me that will save me money long term? Side note, one thing that I have an issue with is breakers buying vast amounts of product which then inadvertently drives the price up. I have been able to get a box of Topps premier league for around $150 and snag two boxes, that pro",

          "text": "Determining Signature Card Values Obviously price is what the market dictates, but seeing how this question is asked a hundred times as the cards get opened, thought id share my thoughts and would like yours. As of right now Lee Sin signed is marked as sold on Tcg $1,200. Then ive seen ebay listings in fb group of Ahri $400ish and Voli $700ish My personal opinion is a good amount would be 2x value of what we see from Chinese market (closest counterpart). Im basing this off of Pokémons Japanese to English comparison. Japan being english pokemons closest counterpart. Also to get a signed card is around 30 boxes or 720 packs. When compared to something like Pokemon chase card the Unbreon Vmax which is about 1/2000 packs. I dont know the math on specific signatures, it might be higher. That card at that rarity sat at $600-$800 for longest time before the scalper boom past year and half. Now people might say wait... theres 15 signature card types, so pulling a specific one is significantly harder, so value should be higher. But i argue that the difference in Pokemon comparison is theres no cards (except rayquaza) from that set that came even close to the price point. So until the characters popularity come into play, they should all be around the same value and highly tradable. Just something to consider. Seeing the chinese market i would say English signature should be around $400-$600. That being said we saw what leesin sold and people are asking $2k already. But in a month hundreds of signed cards will flood the market cutting that in half or more id imagine. What are your thoughts?",

When I was a kid, I lived in a middle class family. high end cards (u/d mostly ) were 4-5$/pack and cheap cards (pro set) was under 1$. like many kids my age, I did dumb stuff, I had patrick roy and brett hull rookie cards when I was like 6 years old and completely destroyed them, they ended up round loll. when I realized what I did a few years later I decided to collect hockey cards.. there was card shops everywhere, the ambiance was awesome, I used to spend hours there almost daily. adults and such could afford the best looking series while I could only buy myself a pack of pro-set here and there, I was jealous, very eager to reach this point. the day I got my first foil from upper deck was a very special day. it was a gretzky foil worth some 18$ or so.. I was ecstatic. kept that card for 20 years. I recently restarted collecting cards and noticed that everything changed. the price are out of this world, there are 200 different flavors you can buy. and they are all upper-deck. after some digging I came to pinpoint the culprit to be the diamond classification upper deck attributes to a dealer. this essencially killed the moms and pops card shop, now only huge stores remain where there is pressure to buy and where the kids can't afford sh1t all and are seen as a semi-nuisance. it got me somewhat angry.. I hated my experience, in fact I buy exclusively online now, I have not traded or sold a card since I restarted a few years back because there are no community, events or places where you can exchange about your passion, beside online forums with mostly trolls. kids cannot use ebay, or any of these trading apps. kids do not work, kids cannot generate 13$/day to buy a pack of cards. how the hell, is this hobby supposed to survive if it behaves like amateur radio boomers. the kids are left aside.. the future of the hobby is trampled on (and as a byproduct, the ",

          "text": "Most ‘I Buy Sports Cards’ Buyers Disappear When You Mention eBay Sold Prices 😅😭 I recently messaged about 20 local buyers who advertise that they purchase sports cards. I told them I have a large collection with many high value pieces. For several of them, I even sent photos of some of my better cards. Almost all of them asked whether I had cards of specific players (including rookies), and I said yes. In the end, I explained that my collection is very large I have cards from almost every sport and many players. I said if someone wants to buy in person, I’m willing to sell below market, roughly 70% of market value for most items, and I’d do my best to make a deal. I also said I would price based on recent eBay sold listings. As soon as I mentioned eBay sold comps, most of them lost interest. So I’m asking, do these people actually want to buy cards... or are they trying to pressure sellers into letting valuable collections go at unreasonably low prices? Unfortunately, scammers and predatory buyers are everywhere. Please be careful. My advice to fellow collectors _Don’t let strangers set your prices. Always check recent eBay sold listings (not asking prices) and use that as your baseline. _Know your range. If you need quick cash, decide your discount in advance (e.g., 70–85% of market depending on card/liquidity). Don’t let someone talk you down further on the spot. _Meet safely & in public if selling locally. _Be cautious with “I buy collections” posts. 🚨😅 Many of these buyers only want deep discounts far below comps. If someone refuses to use sold data, that’s a red flag. _Remember you have options. If you’re patient, you can sell online a little below market and still do better than a lowball local offer. Stay safe, do your own research, and protect the value of your collection",

          "text": "Need advice on how to handle large inherited sports card collection! My dad passed away about 4 years ago and left my sister and me millions of sports cards — mostly baseball but some other sports too. He had them valued at over $120k at one point and was really into eBay buying and selling. He had thousands of cards graded and kept a detailed price book, but we honestly can’t make sense of any of it. We don’t know how to spot the more valuable cards or where to even start. We’re also realistic that we’ll probably take a loss if we sell everything, but we don’t want to just give away something that might have value. What’s the best approach for handling something like this? Are there apps, websites, or services that can help identify or value cards efficiently?",

A few immediate red flags popped up for me - 1) I sold as a set of 3, non sequentially numbered, but if 1 was “fake” then wouldn’t the whole set be? 2) buyer purchased in late July. Why are they reaching out now? 3) whenever I am in possession of a graded card/item, I do my due diligence and verify the cert number. When I originally bought the card that the buyer is claiming to be fake, it showed up on the website with a picture. Did the buyer just blindly buy my item and not research herself? Was the card reported “stolen” after I sold it, between date of sale and when she reached back out? Any help appreciated",

Though it is has some slight wear and a couple small splits in the corners, it's still my gem! Just started playing the Early Days Collection on Switch because of all the nostalgia. I can't help but wonder how many of these could be out there. There's very few sales of the first run with the GOAT promos, most coming from Heritage Auctions. I saw the Ruxin video from a while ago where he got scammed with a resealed one, but didn't know his pirce or if he got another one after that.",

It's a little bit weird as we've seen many of these cards in a Wrestlemania focused release, and there's a mix of excitement for finally getting new product and...a lack of excitement on the design elements - but it's probably worth having an area for information **Checklists**: Topps has an official checklist posted [here ](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/9749/5709/files/CheckList_25CCJW_Final.pdf?v=1755631406). There will be stronger presentations of this checklist elsewhere - including[ Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/news/2025-topps-chrome-wwe-x-cactus-jack-wrestling-cards/), [Cardsmiths Breaks](https://cardsmithsbreaks.com/full-checklist/2025-topps-chrome-wwe-cactus-jack/), and [Visual Checklist](http://www.visualchecklist.com) depending on what you need and want. The set includes * 100 Base Cards * 101 distinct autograph cards (across all set designs) * 60 Astroknights Inserts * 60 Famed Phantoms Inserts * 50 Rodeo Rebels Inserts * 40 Festival Fury inserts * 60 Kings of the Night Inserts (Case Hits) * 40 Trance Technicians Inserts (Case Hits) **Odds**: This isn't unusual, but Topps does not have odds out for release day - once they are out they will be posted [here ](https://www.topps.com/pages/odds)as well as added to some of the other checklist sites. **Configuration**: The product is in **hobby box format only** (as far as we know) * 4 cards a pack (though we have seen overstuffed packs) * 20 packs a box * 12 boxes a case **Per Box** Contents include: * 2 Base Card Refractors * 1 Base Card White Refractor * 1 Base Card Red & Black Refractor * 1 Base Card Black & Yellow Refractor * 4 Base Card Numbered Parallels * These parallels include cards numbered to /325, /250, /199, /175, /150, /125, /99, /75, /50, /41, /25, /10, /5, /1 There is no guarantee on inserts , but ",

          "text": "How I turned a 400$ commercial zero turn to 2,000$ (my 4th mower flip) Picked up this 2007 Yazoo Kees Mid Max commercial zero turn mower after talking the seller down from $750 to $400. It wasn’t some blown-up, hopeless project, the motor already ran fine. The seller just couldn’t keep it mowing because it kept shredding belts (likely from improper routing). When I got it, the mower was dirty and unable to move under its own power. The motor itself ran strong, so I figured it was worth the gamble. I ended up replacing the drive belt and putting on a deck belt, swapped in a new ignition solenoid and 25A fuse (one-time issue I tracked down), added some fuel stabilizer/cleaner to flush out old gas gunk, and eventually had to put on new rear tires after puncturing one while mowing my own yard (previous where already tubed and dry rotted, but did hold air) Total labor was maybe 6 hours spread over a weekend. After cleaning it up and putting about 8 hours of mowing on it myself, I listed it and sold for $2,000 cash in just two weeks. The numbers worked out great: purchase price was $400, total parts and supplies were about $400, so I was all-in for $800. Sold for $2,000, which left me with a $1,200 profit. This was my fourth riding mower flip, and honestly the smoothest. And I’m nowhere near done so expect to see more from this page!",

Appreciate any thoughts-been a long ride putting this together and wanted to finally share it with a community that gets it.",

He says he wants to chat to his son first, who knows about guitars. I tell him that's fine. Hit me up when he's ready. Today he messaged back saying he would like it, but he can't buy it without his son seeing it too and they live an hour away... This is the funny part He'd like to collect it, bring it to his son and if his son approves he will mail a check. I was nice about explaining how it doesn't work like that. I did tell him he could buy it and if he doesn't like it I will buy it back off him providing the condition is the same for 10% less.",

          "text": "Micro SD Express Card Guide for Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of storage right out of the box. However, if you own/buy a lot of games and would like to upgrade to a higher capacity of storage, you'll need a **Micro SD Express card.** These are different from normal Micro SD, Micro SDHC, and Micro SDXC cards, denoted by the **EX** on the card. Normal Micro SD card speeds range from [2-312MB/s](https://www.kingston.com/en/blog/personal-storage/memory-card-speed-classes). However, to bring Nintendo Switch 2 somewhat closer in line with speeds that the SSDs that PS5 and Xbox Series consoles use, the system requires the use of high-speed \"Express\" memory. These speeds are upwards of 600-900MB/s. The good news is that your Nintendo Switch 2 games will load faster. Both the system and cartridges for Nintendo Switch 2 utilize the Express technology which have led to the high prices of these cards for publishers and the creation of the \"Game Key Card\" to avoid this extra cost. But overall, new games for the console will load much faster. The bad news: **your old Micro SD cards that you've been using for Nintendo Switch will** ***NOT*** **work on your Nintendo Switch 2 for storing game data**–inserting your current Micro SD card will only show your screenshots and videos, but you cannot play games off of them, be it Switch 1 or Switch 2 games. Micro SD Express cards are relatively new, but you can find some already on the market if you'd like to purchase one for Nintendo Switch 2. The small variation in the speeds of these cards are a miniscule difference and likely won't matter in everday gaming use. ***Note - be careful you buy an \"Express\" card, and not an \"Extreme\" card, as Extreme cards are not Express.*** Again, look for the \"EX\" on the card itself. If it has the EX logo, you're in the clear. **Micro SD Express cards in the US:** ***128GB EX*** · SanDisk - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-128GB-microSD-Express-SDSQXFN-128G-GN4NN/dp/B0DFQKQ9",

I like the magazine vibe and was considering getting a 1 year subscription of it for $45 or so to get a better grasp on card prices. Or should I jsut go in on a online/app web site for accurate pricing? Or is eBay the king now?? Thanks! \\*TYPO - Beckett in title",

          "text": "(NOT A DEAL) An attempted guide at buying EVERY Scarlet & Violet set online at retail in 2025 Hey r/PokemonDealsUK ! Firstly, apologies for a post that's not really focused on a good deal. Please forgive me! As we all know, the hobby has grown in popularity significantly over the last few months which has been great to see. We've got more budding collectors and shiny cardboard enthusiasts than we've had for a fair few years in the UK now, but the consequence of this which we've all learned the hard way is that actually finding product to rip and good deals to save money is becoming increasingly difficult. Now over the last few weeks, I've experienced far too many people from brand new collectors to stressed parents complain in public, on this subreddit or over on r/PokemonTCG_UK about how they can't find stock for any set anywhere. So that's basically the inspiration for this post. I imagine most frustrations will understandably be aimed at Prismatic Evolutions, but I figured I'd create this post to highlight how you can buy any set from the Scarlet and Violet era of Pokemon cards. If this post can even help just one person out, then my work is done! Before getting into it, a few potentially pointless things to note: - If you'd like to try your luck in public, your priority stores are places like: Smyths, WHSmith, Waterstones, GAME and HMV. Supermarkets can be good too but stock has dried up a lot from my own personal experience. - I've not checked every single online store, so if you can find even better deals, that's great! - Extending on the above, I've not checked Amazon as their URLs are too long, same for eBay too. But a few sets have Booster Bundle Boxes available. - While the standard retail price of a single pack is £4.29 (not counting special sets), these prices differ for other sealed products like Blisters and Elite Trainer Boxes and the price per pack (PP) is higher. Just chucking this in to be safe. - For a couple of sets, it was basically impossible t",

          "text": "Massive Complete Set Collection (please help) I’m looking for a bit of help from the community on pricing and selling a really large complete collection of Topps cards. Thanks in advance for your help! I’ve read the pricing guide but it still leaves a few questions. First I’ll list what I have. Complete Sets of Series 1,2,3 in both holo and non holo - all blue label Complete Sets of Mewtwo Strikes Back and Pokemon 2000 in both holo and non holo - all blue label Additionally I have (all complete sets): - series 1 holo black label - series 1 and 2 non holo blue label - series 3 holo blue label - non holo pokemon 2000 blue label. My biggest question is that I am wondering how to go about pricing and selling all of this. I’ve checked recently sold on eBay and have comps for some.of it, but not all. I’m also curious if it might make sense to list the entire Blue Label complete set as one item, then list the duplicates and extras on their own. It’s all been in binders, sleeves, cases or sleeves and top loaders since about 2000, most of it is LP-NM, some of it is mint. I added some pictures of some of the pages / top loaders etc for reference. Thanks again for taking the time to read this post :) Also - I have some miscellaneous duplicates and bulk of all these sets, holo and non holo, that I’d be happy to send off to someone if they were able to help me get this all ready to sell!",

I wanted to list a working 16TB hard drive, eBay suggested BIN of $11. eeeehhhhh????? Even a non-working 16TB HD is more than $50 so I have no idea why eBay thought this specific brand and model should be sold at $11. I sell LEGO set that I pick up locally at clearance sale and had a couple of 76419 that I picked up for $80 new, they normally go for $170 retail price and a few on eBay for more than $100 used. What did eBay suggest for my 76419, new in box? $22 each!! I really wish I can turn off suggested price permanently because it's using unreliable AI that can't account for condition and/or completeness, and may have grabbed data off someone's replacement firmware chip for the hard drive or a gold colored minifig out of that LEGO set and assumed it represented the whole thing. PS multiple choice listing sucks too. $100 item with $0.99 microfiber cloth makes them show up first when sorted by cheapest. Also keep out of stock listing sucks, they show up weeks and even months as OOS to draw buyer who would think look at seller's other item and end up with a much more expensive item.",

Then List for high amounts, probably have insider friends “Buy” at those high prices trying to force the prices Up. Swindling the few that just buy in along the way. If you are Unaware, new to hobby, been around, any and everyone, please do some research before over spending on Cards that are no where worth these inflated prices. Dont be buying cards out of fear of missing out, patience is key, save your money, more always come along. Leave them with their copies, dont allow them to Profit. They will have to Dump them back eventually. Prices will come back down to reality. Now If you are an outsider to all this and are thinking of selling some of these inflated Cards, thinking its worth 5x or so more now, it really isnt. Expect people to low ball you with realistic prices on Ebay, or where ever you sell. Community needs to tighten up and smarten up. Thanks.

On further review, it looks like both the Chourio and Caglione Auto cards are labeled with the same number: B24-JC. On the Beckett site it looks like the card number for Caglione is supposed to be B24-JCE. So it seems that Topps made an error when numbering the Caglione cards, and SGC labeled the card incorrectly by name but correctly by number. I’m sure SGC will make it right (they always do), but it’s certainly a strange situation.",

          "text": "BEST VALUE OUT THERE! 2025 STADIUM CLUB MEGA BOXES! NEW RELEASE! Hey everybody, welcome back to the brand new release preview video. Today we've got Stadium Club for you. And I was really shocked and amazed when I went to bring in my cases today of these mega boxes. I about hurt my back picking up. It was so heavy. I was like, \"What? Why are these mega box cases so heavy?\" Usually like for Bowman Draft Megas, the Chrome update megas, Chrome Megas, like those things are super light because there's only 32 cards per box. I expected that with this. I couldn't believe how heavy it was. Do you know how many cards in a mega box of Stadium Club? There's more than a hobby box. There are 144 cards in these mega boxes, which is absolutely almost unthinkable to me. It's crazy. So, before we go into this, we're going to cover the mega box video today. We'll do the hobby box tomorrow and I don't know, maybe we'll do the blasters on Friday. But take a look at this price breakdown here. So, we have the mega boxes. They're the MSRP is 50 bucks on those, but the number of cards is 144 cards. Stadium Club is known for its quality, the great photography, the glossy cards and everything. And I just can't believe that they're giving you that many cards in that more than a hobby box. So take a look. It's 35 cents per card with the megas. The hobby box, which MSRP at 129, by the way, they're selling for $200 a piece online. So Dave and Adam, Steel City, blow, they're all $200 a piece there today, which is just crazy to me, which is what would that work out to be like a $1.75 a card or something like that. Somewhere in that vicinity. And you only get one autograph. So why are we paying so much more per card? Why are we paying just MSRP? $80 more for one auto. I don't know. I guess we'll find out when we rip open those hobby boxes tomorrow. And then the blaster boxes is just another way to flush money down the drain. It's just not very good. Only 40 cards in a blaster box, 62 cents a card. ",

          "text": "The Power of Holding Your Sports Cards The hobby talks about buying. It talks about selling. It celebrates flips, upgrades, and big auction results. It rarely talks about holding. In this flagship episode of Stacking Slabs, Brett explores the power of keeping the right cards in a market that rewards motion. He breaks down why holding is underserved in a culture built on velocity and why conviction matters more than constant movement. Drawing from his own collecting journey, Brett outlines the three buckets he uses before buying any card and the only three reasons he will sell. The conversation moves into the psychology of ownership, the tension between attachment and arbitrage, and why not every 1/1 deserves long term status. At the center of the episode is one grounding question: If the market shut down for five years, which cards would you still be proud to own? This episode challenges collectors to define their lanes, clarify their rules, and build alignment between their purchases and their purpose. Buy with intention. Sell with discipline. Hold with conviction. Check out the awesome software that InfernoRed Technology can build for you.

Tory from dcsports87 felt it firsthand with $14M in sales in one month and no slowdown in sight. This episode lives at the intersection of data, demand, and decision making. We break down what record volume looks like inside one of the largest eBay sellers in the world, why first public sales still shape collector behavior, and how a Tiger Woods party exclusive card became a $27,600 moment of cultural debate. We also get into live selling at the Super Bowl, why starting a $40K card at $1 works when the audience is right, and what it means for collectors when platforms like eBay push live formats to the front of the app. This is a look at the hobby from The Staging Area before the action hits the field.

Eric shares how a simple project for his kids sparked a business that now works with professional athletes, podcasters, and sports teams. He explains the difference between perceived rarity created by big card companies and true one-of-one craftsmanship — where every piece is built by hand around a real artifact. They explore Eric’s creative process, from foiling and textures to embedding relics, and how each design starts with the story behind the item. Ryan and Eric also talk about scaling a fully custom operation, navigating exclusivity in professional sports, and how social media helped propel Reclaim Customs into the spotlight. The episode closes on one of Eric’s most meaningful insights: the most powerful collectibles aren’t always about players or value — they’re about family, memory, and legacy.

In this episode of Passion to Profession, I sit down with Sharon of BlackJadedWolf to talk about what it takes to build a hobby business that lasts. We get into what she’s seeing in the market right now. Repacks. Comps that don’t tell the full story. Where liquidity is real and where it is fragile. Sharon shares how she thinks about responsibility when customers hand her cards that carry real value. Sometimes financial. Sometimes emotional. We talk about why data is a starting point and not a decision-maker. Why research still matters. Why relationships matter more. This is a conversation about independence. About accountability. About playing the long game in a hobby that often rewards short-term thinking. This episode is sponsored by eBay. A special thank you to eBay for sponsoring Passion to Profession .

          "text": "Booked to Last: Royal Rumble Reactions and What the Moment Means for Wrestling Cards Royal Rumble season is the moment when wrestling and collecting collide. Storylines sharpen. Careers tilt. And the card market reacts in real time. What happens in the ring doesn’t stay there. It shows up in sales, demand, and how collectors rethink their positions. In this episode, Adam and Ryan break down the 2026 Royal Rumble through a collector’s lens. They talk about why Liv Morgan’s win mattered beyond the pop, how Roman Reigns winning wasn’t about surprise but certainty, and why WrestleMania season rewards collectors who understand momentum before it becomes obvious. They also dig into AJ Styles’ legacy moment and what consistency looks like in both wrestling and collecting. Not every reaction needs to be a flip. Not every spike needs to be chased. The episode walks through how seasoned collectors separate noise from signal when the spotlight gets brighter. This conversation is about staying grounded when the market heats up. About knowing when to act, when to hold, and when to ignore the crowd. If you collect with intention and want your decisions to match what you actually value, this episode will resonate.

Then a Jordan Rookie Walked Into the Shop In this episode of Collector Nation , Ryan Alford and Brian Ludden take listeners inside a week that perfectly captures today’s hobby — digital pulls, vintage surprises, and the unpredictable magic of sports cards. Brian opens up about hitting a massive LeBron refractor through an online pack platform, turning a risky gamble into a $5,000 card. That leads into a spirited debate: Jordan, Kobe, or LeBron — which actually holds long-term value? Ryan makes his case for Jordan, citing vintage scarcity, collector psychology, and why older cards continue to outperform modern print runs. Then Ryan shares an unbelievable story: a suspicious Facebook Marketplace listing turns into a real-life meetup and a full 1986 Fleer set walking into his brand-new card shop — complete with Jordan rookie and bonus Star card. They also discuss opening the shop, why physical retail still matters, how deals really get done, and what makes this hobby so addicting. It’s part investing lesson, part collector storytime — and fully Collector Nation. Key Takeaways Jordan remains the hobby king Digital packs bring upside and risk Vintage scarcity beats manufactured rarity Physical shops create unexpected opportunity Stories drive value The best finds are rarely planned",

          "text": "Why Nostalgia Is the Most Powerful Asset in the Hobby: Media insider explains the power of a story In this episode of Collector Nation, Ryan sits down with Carmine Gemei, Sports Director at FOX Carolina, to break down the real psychology behind collecting sports cards — and why vintage cards continue to outperform hype-driven modern trends. Carmine brings a rare perspective as both a media professional and lifelong collector, explaining how storytelling, nostalgia, scarcity, and human behavior all influence long-term card value. From Larry Bird and Magic Johnson to Bo Jackson and iconic inscriptions, this episode dives deep into why certain cards transcend generations. The conversation also explores how media is changing, why human-interest stories matter more than highlights, and how collectors can think more strategically about what they buy, hold, and sell. Whether you’re a seasoned collector or just getting back into the hobby, this episode offers insight you won’t get from price charts alone. Topics Covered • Why vintage sports cards hold long-term value • Collecting psychology vs hype-driven buying • Media storytelling and collectibles • Inscriptions, scarcity, and rarity premiums • Nostalgia as an asset class • Vintage vs modern card risk • Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and iconic cards • How collectors should think in 2026 Stay Connected To stay up to date on all things Carolina Sports: Foxcarolina.com/sports Follow CarminesCards on Instagram!

Earlier in the year a seller listed one with a price 5-10 times the typical market value for these things. OK, sure, hopeful sellers exist. Then a while later another seller clearly sees that auction and lists one in better condition for 10-15X the normal price. After that, yet another seller lists one for 15-20X. You see where this is headed? Now at this point every single one of these on eBay is listed for hundreds or even thousands more than they've ever sold for. And this isn't like a rare machine part that a desperate factory manager will buy to keep the production line going. I'm wondering if a market can get permanently broken. At least until a brave seller decides to list one for $1000 less than their competition to actually get a sale going again.",

So, I bought a 1K+ grail card from PSA on eBay. The listing said \"USPS GA\" under the shipping (See attached). [This was next to the card as \\\\\"Shipping\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/fmkjp11zmnkg1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7d65dd7e65d2bd442f7a746816e5035bf9cde8a) So, after 4 days, the order updates and a tracking # is provided... for FedEx. The thing is, I have a PO Box and USPS shipping was a must, given FedEx doesn't deliver to PO Boxes. FedEx, in my area has a really bad rep, and I'll leave it at that. I've messaged PSA through eBay (going on 3 days ago) and received no response. I called the PSA (the grading line) and they don't know anything saying eBay is a different department. Furthermore, they don't know how to contact them 🤦♂️. My understanding is that USPS has stopped doing \"last mile deliveries\" for FedEx. So, I fear this is going to get to the PO then get turned right back around. has anyone encountered this? What happened? Thanks!",

I Was polite and just said I was disappointed in their handling and hoped they could rectify their mistake and management of my card. submitted several picture PRE grade with dates of when I took them, with my card out of the sleeve and got their response back today. This has to be a joke right? Like someone needs to do something about this company because it is asinine to think this is an appropriate response and they can get away with this. I’ve attached my submission pictures along with the damaged corner and their response. along with the pictures I gave them for submission. Is it even worth replying back and fighting or should I just give up?",

(Credit: Getty Images) By Ben Burrows — January 27, 2026 Share Sam Darnold, the former No. 3 overall pick turned NFL journeyman, has finally bucked the bust narrative with an improbable career revival, and his sports card market has followed suit. Darnold and the Seattle Seahawks will face the New England Patriots and Drake Maye in Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8, delivering a matchup of a former collector favorite with a current hobby darling. Maye has been arguably the NFL's most collectible player during his historic sophomore season — his nearly 42,000 sales tracked data tool Market Movers over the last 30 days and the more than 208,000 sales over the last 365 days both rank No. 1 among football players over those respective periods. Sam Darnold's 2018 Panini National Treasures Stars & Striples RPA sold for $10,081 at Alt in November. (Credit: Alt) Darnold’s market has orchestrated its own surge, particularly over the last week, after collectors more or less abandoned hope for a turnaround when the USC product bounced from the Jets to the Panthers and 49ers before finally breaking out with Minnesota in 2024. Market Movers has tracked more than 5,900 sales for Darnold over the last year, with more than 1,100 of those finalizing in the last seven days. Of the football players tracked by Market Movers, those 5,900 sales for Darnold rank just 87th over the last year. Over the last week, which included a 346-yard, three-touchdown performance i",

(Credit: PSA) By Will Stern — January 27, 2026 Share Four autographed Babe Ruth cards were discovered in an old scrapbook in 2019, found among the pages that included hundreds of newspaper clippings and photos assembled in the 1930s. One of those cards, a 1933 Goudey No. 181 with a PSA 4.5 condition grade and a PSA/DNA 8 autograph grade — the highest-graded condition of any Goudey card signed by Ruth known to exist — is set to sell at Goldin Auctions next month, carrying a current bid of $793,000, including buyer’s premium. The Goudey is the highest-graded autographed card from Ruth's playing days. (Credit: Goldin Auctions) The find was originally sold off by Mile High Card Company in 2019. At the time, the auction house’s founder, Brian Drent, told PSA, \"I have handled and seen the best of the best that the hobby has to offer since establishing my company in 1996. ... This material is not only in the upper echelon of what has come into the marketplace, it has also provided me with a personal story I'll never forget.\" According to Drent, he never even met with the original family of the man who put the scrapbook together. The man's son was, to his knowledge, still alive and in his late 80s at the time of the discovery six years ago, and the family negotiated the terms of sale through an intermediary. “They wanted to remain anonymous, and they wanted it to be a cash transaction. So, I flew in to Philadelphia with a suitcase filled with cash, rented a car and drove an hour-and-a-half to th",

(Credit: Fanatics Collect) By Matt Liberman — January 26, 2026 Share We have our first million-dollar card sale of 2026, and it's a title fit for the King. A 2003 Topps Chrome Gold Refractor LeBron James Rookie /50, graded PSA 10, sold on Friday for $1.11 million, becoming the first card to reach the seven-digit mark this year. The card was sold as part of the Fanatics Premier auction that also featured Nick Kurtz's RDPA selling for $516,000 as well as a Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Green Kaboom! 1/1 that fetched a record $432,000. With this sale, James is now featured on 25 different cards to cross the $1 million threshold, more than Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant combined. This is the second-most-expensive sale ever for James' 2003 Topps Chrome Gold Refractor, trailing a $1.2 million private sale in August 2022. The sale also might indicate the current strength of the market. After the COVID-19 boom in 2020 and 2021, this card dipped a bit in the market. As recently as October 2024, another James PSA 10 2003 Topps Chrome Gold Refractor sold for $645,000 at Heritage. This sale nearly doubled that price just 15 months later.

By Darren Rovell — January 23, 2026 Share The most talked-about card currently up for bid is in a new holder. Goldin Auctions founder and CEO Ken Goldin revealed Friday he had PSA reholder Logan Paul’s Pokémon Pikachu Illustrator, which is graded PSA 10. Bidding for the card has hit $6.324 million, including buyer’s premium, with 23 days remaining in the auction. Set to close Feb. 15 as part of Goldin’s 2026 Pokémon and TCG Auction, the auction has now surpassed the $5.275 million Paul paid for the card in 2021, which set the old record. Goldin got a brand new 2026 PSA slab for the 1/1 Pikachu Illustrator. The current bid is $6,324,000, which means it already broke its own record for most expensive Pokémon card in the world. pic.twitter.com/eJsRGUos8b — cllct (@cllctMedia) January 23, 2026 Consigned to Goldin during an episode of Netflix’s “King of Collectibles: The Goldin Touch,” Paul’s Illustrator has been one of the most high-profile trading cards to hit the auction block. Some critics had attacked the grading on the card, saying it shouldn’t have been the only Illustrator to get a 10. But Goldin and Paul believed some of that noise had to do with some damage to the holder. Paul had a diamond necklace made so he could wear the card during his WWE debut and other special events. But Goldin noticed the diamonds hitting the slab caused scratches and dings. “What I wanted to do was put it in a fresh, clean, new holder th",

(Credit: Heritage Auctions) By Will Stern — January 22, 2026 Share After a relative dearth of opportunities for collectors to purchase the famed T206 Honus Wagner card at public auction over the last few years, 2026 has started off strong. With Goldin Auctions currently selling a newly discovered Wagner, Heritage Auctions is now poised to sell the SGC Authentic Garagiola Wagner in March, with the card carrying a pre-sale estimate of $3 million . The Garagiola Wagner, named for its previous owner, baseball player and broadcaster Joe Garagiola, has only sold once publicly — in 2021 for $2.52 million. According to Garagiola’s son, who originally consigned the card to Heritage in 2021, his father traded his 1954 Giants uniform from their World Series championship season, among other items, for the card decades ago. When dealing with the most iconic and one of the rarest cards in the hobby, comps are always tough to come by, however, the $3 million estimate falls within reason. It might even be a bit conservative considering the growth of the industry and the high-end market since its last sale in 2021 and the premium placed on non-restored copies. The newly discovered Wagner currently at Goldin has already earned 28 bids in its first 24 hours of bidding to bring it over $4 million (including buyer’s premium) with 30 days remaining. That card is graded PSA 1, and numerically graded Wagners earn a hefty premium over their authentic counterparts. The timing of both sales, which will be effectively competing w",

What started as an 11-year-old boy’s request for a hobby box of 2024 Topps Chrome Update Baseball for Christmas turned into a once-in-a-lifetime pull and the redemption for the most talked-about card in recent memory. Skenes' Rookie Debut Patch Auto card has been on a cross-country tour since it surfaced publicly in January. (Credit: Topps) Since then, the Skenes RDPA has been on a roughly 7,000-mile cross-country trek over the last two months, leading to the card’s eventual sale in Fanatics Collect’s upcoming March Premier Auction. Following its creation at Topps’ Dallas-area facility in mid-January, the card was hand-delivered by Fanatics vice president Kevin Lenane to the boy’s Los Angeles-area home before making a pit stop at PSA’s Santa Ana office for grading. Lenane then carried the card to New York for marketing obligations before it eventually landed in New Orleans, where it walked the red carpet alongside Fanatics CEO Michael Rubin at the Fanatics Super Bowl party — it was even briefly reunited with Skenes for a photograph before heading back to the West Coast. Now, the card will be the showcase item in Fanatics' March Premier Auction, which runs from Thursday until March 20. For collectors, the sale of Skenes’ RD",

(Credit: Hunt Auctions) By Darren Rovell — November 17, 2025 Share Honus Wagner's card made him a legend. The T206 is somehow more well-known than Wagner's Hall of Fame career. Yet autographed Wagner memorabilia is progressively getting more expensive. Last week, a single-signed Wagner ball, with an estimate of $25,000 to $50,000, sold at Hunt Auctions for $123,375, falling just short of the $126,000 record at Heritage in May 2021. The Hunt signature was given a near mint 7 by PSA/DNA, matching a single-signed Wagner near-mint 7 sold by Goldin in 2013. That ball sold for $37,645. RELATED STORIES: Hall of Fame program signed by Ruth, Cobb, Wagner sells for record $315k Despite $4.15 million bid, T206 Honus Wagner card fails to meet reserve Why the $2 million price for T206 Honus Wagner is major cause for concern For first time in 30 years, no T206 Honus Wagner sold publicly in 2024 Wagner's signatures are not rare. He played for 21 seasons, and he coached for 19 more. For 10 years, the member of the initial Hall of Fame class had a sporting goods store in Pittsburgh, where fans could get his autograph. There are plenty of Wagner-signed index cards, business cards and government postcards, and they are still relatively cheap compared to balls — he signed much fewer than Babe Ruth — but even those haven risen in value. On Sunday, a Wagner-signed government postcard sold for nearly $2,000 at Grey Flannel Auctions, roughly three times the price of what the equivale",

(Credit: The PRyan Collection on Instagram) By Patrick Ryan, as told to Darren Rovell — August 07, 2025 Share Last June, I spent $14,047.20 at Lelands Auctions on an autograph book featuring a bunch of signatures of baseball stars, including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. When I won the auction, my plan was to get each page slabbed. But when I came up to the Ruth page, it seemed like the small signature on the large paper could create a special opportunity. Knowing I was going to be at the \"Sotheby's x Fanatics\" auction in September, and Tom Brady was going to be there, I thought about making a GOAT piece, adding Brady to my Ruth ... and then eventually icons from basketball (Michael Jordan), hockey (Wayne Gretzky) and soccer (Lionel Messi). Ryan had the piece authenticated by PSA with the label \"Sports GOATS.\" (Credit: The PRyan Collection on Instagram At the auction, I won a Jackie Robinson card and sat behind Brady, who didn't win any of the cards. When he got up, I said to Brady, \"Hey, I don't want you to leave empty-handed,\" and I gave him a ticket to \"The Catch\" — otherwise known as Joe Montana's epic pass to Dwight Clark — from 1982. Brady famously attended that historic NFC Championship Game as a kid. Brady said thanks, and I asked him quickly if he could sign an autograph, and he obliged. He was going through the motions of his usual signing when he looked down on the page, and his eyes widened — all of a sudden, h",

The ticket is one of the most sought-after in baseball history. (Credit: Heritage Auctions) The ticket stub is graded PSA 1.5 and is one of nine graded by PSA. Four have been graded higher. Tickets from Gehrig’s iconic speech, which he delivered to a crowd of 60,000 at Yankee Stadium, are among the most significant in the ticket collecting hobby, right up there with Jackie Robinson’s major-league debut. It is rare to see copies up for auction. Heritage sold a PSA 2 example for $108,000 in February 2022. In 2014, before the prices for graded tickets took off, the sole autographed copy of a ticket from that day sold for $95,600.

(Credit: eBay) By Darren Rovell — December 03, 2025 Share A ticket to the first leg of the first Triple Crown will sell Wednesday on eBay, with a chance to beat the all-time record for a horse racing ticket. The ticket to the 1919 Kentucky Derby, which saw Sir Barton win in front of a then-record crowd of 50,000 fans, had reached a high bid of $30,058 as of Wednesday at 10:30 a.m ET, less than 10 hours ahead of the auction close. That price is higher than Sir Barton’s ownership received for the win that day ($20,800), albeit not factoring for inflation. \"It's exceedingly rare and arguably the most significant Kentucky Derby ticket a collector could own,\" PSA's chief ticket authenticator Matt Fuller said. \"The PSA pop on this is only two, and I was lucky enough to see both of them come in.\" Sir Barton was a co-favorite to win the race, but he had not posted a single win in his six career starts. He did a big advantage, however — the horse weighed 4 1/2 pounds less than any other horse in the field. The record price paid for a horse racing ticket was $45,600 for a full 1937 Kentucky Derby ticket, the first of three wins by War Admiral. The record paid for a Sir Barton piece of memorabilia is for the Derby trophy presented to the horse’s owner, J.K.L. Ross, which sold for $71,700 in 2015 at Heritage. Sir Barton swept the Triple Crown races in a span of 32 days, leading wire-to-wire in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. The three races — the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes — were formalized as a group of races in 1875, but the name Triple Crown wasn’t attached to the",

Too good to be true? Evaluating a press pass from an all-time NHL moment Press pass said to be from Bobby Orr's 'Flying Goal' sells on eBay — but is it the real deal? Bobby Orr's \"Flying Goal\" to win the 1970 Stanley Cup final is commemorated with a statue outside the TD Garden. (Credit: Getty Images) By Darren Rovell — July 31, 2025 Share One of the main reasons I love collecting tickets is because there is great arbitrage value — especially when the buyer knows something the seller does not. Being aware something historic happened at a certain game and then getting that ticket graded could yield a turnaround of thousands of dollars. That said, there are also sellers who know collectors are seeking this advantage and play the game in reverse. A press credential sold on eBay for $76. on Wednesday night. It was listed as \"Bobby Orr 'Flying Goal' Ticket Press Pass 1970.\" Every detail on the press pass needed to be closely examined. (Credit: eBay) Now, Orr's flying goal is one of the greatest moments in hockey history and represents an iconic collectible that I'd love to own. So, I went deep in my evaluation to decide if I should bid on this lot. Let's take it step by step with the questions I asked as I investigated: 1. Does the item appear authentic? The credential certainly looks like it could be an old pass, though the gold color seems to be a little aggressive for the 1970s. I would expect it to be a mustard yellow. The writing looks authentically faded. It has the markings of what would make sense with the game being \"SC4\" (Game 4 of the Stanley Cup final) and it being versus the \"STL Blues.\" 2. Can you make the leap the item is from the game listed? All the details on the press pass are hand-wr",

In celebration of Masters week, the cllct 10 looks at Tiger's top memorabilia items Tiger Woods' \"Sunday Red\" Nike golf shirt became his trademark during his run of dominance. By Will Stern — April 10, 2024 Share Tiger Woods is scheduled to tee off Thursday for his 26th Masters appearance. Woods has won five Masters tournaments, most recently taking the Green Jacket in 2019 when he earned his first 15th major. Despite struggling with injuries and playing just a single full round on the PGA Tour in 2024, Woods remains one of the sport's biggest draws, in addition to a dominant force in the memorabilia market. We took a look back at Woods’ most valuable memorabilia sales in the Tiger Woods cllct10. Woods' 2001 SP Authentic “Authentic Stars” Gold Card ranks as his most valuable card. (Credit: Goldin Auctions) 1. Card record The most valuable Tiger card ever sold is his 2001 SP Authentic “Authentic Stars” Gold Card, serial numbered to 100 and featuring an on-card autograph. One of the 16 PSA 10 examples went for $336,000 at Goldin Auctions in March 2021. The card was produced by Upper Deck, which has had an exclusive license with Woods for more than two decades. 2. Ticket record Golden Age Auctions sold a signed ticket from Woods’ 1992 PGA debut at the Nissan Open for $104,694 in April 2022. It’s one of just three examples signed by Woods and authenticated by PSA. In addition to featuring Fred Couples’ signature, Golden Age declared in its auction listing that it was signed contemporaneously by then-16 years old Tiger Woods. 3.

(Credit: Getty Images) By Darren Rovell — October 14, 2024 Share It turned out to be one of the most fortuitous ticket finds in collectible history. A 50-year fan of the Oakland A's, who missed many games in 1989 as a partial season ticket holder, sold a lot of 13 full tickets from that season for a whopping $40,100 on eBay. The lot featured 113 bids. His combined cost for the 13 field level tickets, 35 years ago? $130! The reason? One of the tickets, from Opening Day of that season, is the first full ticket from Ken Griffey Jr.'s debut that has ever been seen. “I’m amazed at this unexpected bonus in life and at a very timely moment,” the A's fan told cllct about his new windfall. “I have been trying to complete a decade’s long personal photography project, and it looks like funding might have arrived.” The man, who requested to remain anonymous, originally posted the 13 tickets without any description, but after getting offers of up to $7,000 for the lot on eBay, told cllct it was time to do some research. Before posting the tickets, the man said he has cross-checked the dates with highlights from the A's 1989 season — but he hadn't looked closely at the visiting teams. He had moved from Oakland to New Mexico in retirement and had gone back through his boxes where he had stored his tickets to \"clean house\" after relocating. \"I didn't think of money when I was saving them,\" said the man. \"I kept them as souvenirs.\" To date, PSA has graded 21 tickets to Junior's debut, but a full t",

(Credit: Getty Images) By Matt Liberman — February 08, 2026 Share Fourth-and-1. A little more than 10 minutes remaining. The Super Bowl hanging in the balance. Trailing Miami 17-13 late in Super Bowl XVII at the Rose Bowl, Washington faced that pressure-packed situation in 1983 as the franchise sought its first Super Bowl title. Luckily, the \"Diesel\" was there to carry the day. John Riggins broke a tackle at the line and not only got the first down, he rambled for a 43-yard touchdown that put the then-Redskins ahead to stay in a game they would win 27-17. The jersey Riggins wore that day in an 166-yard performance that won him the game's MVP award sold at the Super Bowl LX Live Auction Event for $470,000, besting its high-end estimate by $270,000. The event marked the 18th year in a partnership between the NFL and Hunt Auctions. Riggins, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1992, played five seasons for the New York Jets before playing his most impactful football in Washington. Additionally, his Super Bowl ring sold for $105,750 \"For me, without the fans, there was no football,\" Riggins said in a statement. \"You gave me something far greater than anything memorabilia can represent. Knowing my teammates and I helped create moments you’ll always remember is the only legacy I need. Now, it feels right to pass these keepsakes along to the people who made them matter in the first place.\" A portion of the proceeds from the auction will go directly toward charities of",

The trading card giant launched 2026 Topps Baseball Series 1 Wednesday morning, it's first official baseball product of the season. And mixed in the millions of cards is a redemption for a '52 Topps Mickey Mantle, unequivocally the most important card in the history of all Topps sports. While Mantle was recently supplanted as having the most expensive card in history by the Michael Jordan-Kobe Bryant Dual Logoman purchased by Kevin O'Leary's team, there's zero doubt that should any of the three PSA 10 Mantles in existence come to market, they would shatter the all-time record for a card. Now this card certainly will not be a PSA 10. But Topps confirmed to cllct the card will be delivered with a PSA grade. Here are the most recent sale prices for each grade of a '52 Mantle: PSA 1: $37,820 (2026) PSA 2: $98,626 (2026) PSA 3: $72,136.16 (2025) PSA 4: $96,000 (2025) PSA 5: $231,484 (2026) PSA 6: $213,500 (2025) PSA 7: $347,700 (2025) PSA 8: $1,555,500 (2025) PSA 9: $5,200,000 (2021) Additionally, there will be redemption cards for two tickets to the 2026 World Series.

          "text": "Seller Stories | Caitlin Clark Gold Vinyl 1/1 Alt Auctions May 27, 2025 A Gold Vinyl Pull, A Hawkeye Dream: Inside the Sale of the Caitlin Clark 1/1 Some cards hit different. For Derrick Tracy, known in the hobby as Daddo Stacks , one pull in particular became more than a chase. It became a memory sealed in gold vinyl. Today, Derrick is auctioning off one of the most coveted cards in the hobby: the 2024 Panini Prizm WNBA Caitlin Clark Gold Vinyl 1/1 rookie, graded PSA 9. And behind that listing is a father-son story that runs deep - from Iowa roots to those thrilling rips. “That one was the card of all cards.” Derrick, a lifelong Iowa Hawkeye born at the University of Iowa Hospital, is no stranger to basketball, or collecting. As a kid, he held onto his 1994 Upper Deck World Cup cards. Years later, the post-COVID hobby boom pulled him back in, this time with his son, Stavi. What started with ripping packs turned into full-on prospecting. Soccer, baseball, and of course, PC-ing their beloved Hawkeyes. The duo created “Stavi Stacks,” went on card show adventures, and traveled all the way to the Dublin Card Show for Stavi’s 15th birthday; a tradition they now keep yearly. But nothing could’ve prepared them for the moment they hit the card. The Hit It was a Sunday night. Derrick had a work trip the next morning, his wife was out to dinner, and he and Stavi decided to rip a box from Blowout Cards. The chase was clear: Caitlin Clark. “We saw the shimmer, and Stavi knew right away; it was the Gold Vinyl,” Derrick said. “We sweated it, opened the rest of the box, and came back to it.” As Stavi revealed the red, then the “C,” they both froze. It was the 1/1. “I stopped recording. We carefully set the card down, and then we jumped around the room, hugged each other. Even my daughters came running downstairs.” The Meaning Behind the Card For Derrick, it was more than just a pull. “I wanted to play for Iowa,” he said. “I played Division II ball at Chaminade in Hawaii and a year",

Caitlin Clark’s Gold Vinyl 1/1 Rookie is live now on Alt Auctions It’s not often a player or card comes along that feels era-defining . But the 2024 Panini Prizm WNBA #145 Caitlin Clark Gold Vinyl 1/1—graded PSA 9—isn’t just another chase. It’s an icon. This is the most notable Caitlin Clark rookie card to hit the open market, and arguably the second most important in existence (the only rival being the true 1/1) and now, it's live on Alt Auctions through May 29. The Pull of a Lifetime Behind the card is a story straight out of hobby lore: a father and son, chasing Caitlin Clark pulls. The father—a lifelong Iowa Hawkeyes fan, former college and semi-pro player—finally landed the holy grail of WNBA collecting. One of the most important Clark rookie cards pulled by someone who’s followed her journey from the start. That's the stuff of hobby dreams. A Record-Breaker in Every Sense Caitlin Clark is rewriting the playbook for women’s sports cards. She’s already toppled Serena Williams' previous record card sales and keeps pushing the bar higher. The ripple effects are massive. For the first time in hobby history, WNBA cards are outselling NBA cards. A 2024 NBA Prizm Hobby Box currently sits at around $400. Meanwhile, the 2024 WNBA Prizm? It’s pushing $900. This isn’t just hype, it’s market-shifting momentum. More Than a Card. It’s a Moment. This Gold Vinyl 1/1 isn’t just a one-of-one. It’s the one. The kind of card that collectors will look back on as the defining rookie of a generation. Could this be the next ’52 Mantle? ’86 Fleer Jordan? Now, the ’24 Clark. If Caitlin keeps her current pace, her next record-breaking sale could surpass the combined rookie highs of Shaq, Tim Duncan, and Jerry West. Yes, combined. Live now, but not for long. The Caitlin Clark Gold Vinyl 1/1 rookie is live now in Alt Auctions , running exclusively for three weeks and closing on May 29 . Once p",

If anyone else reading this submitted anything from this store (Manchester, MO) in October and you're in the same spot...might want to go visit the store... In any case, they offered market price for each card and apologized. It blows to lose some cards that I've had for 25+ years, but I guess they made it right. Maybe they'll find them someday and they'll get returned. Oh well. First and last time using GameStop, though.",

I got this from someone that graded this himself back in the day, and I don't think many sequential PSA10 of this set exists other than this, if any. To me this collection piece captures one of the key moments in Pokemon franchise history, and is a pure nostalgic collection. Sequential certs are somewhat niche and rather common for modern, but for vintage dating back to 1999 and being a set of four cards released as the first Pokemon movie promos, this would be highly coveted by a serious collector. I would love to keep this as my PC, but I would also be content with selling it for the right price that would support my future plans to start a family. Other than listing it on eBay, what would be the best way to \"advertise\" this collection piece? Thanks in advance.",

So I built a tool that does it for me. It’s called Collectors Edge AI — you can either upload a photo of a card or type in a description, and it’ll identify the card, pull real market pricing from eBay sold listings, and give you a buy/sell/hold recommendation. It works with baseball, football, basketball, hockey — pretty much any sport. It also handles graded cards (PSA, BGS, SGC) and gives you low/avg/high price ranges. There’s also a “Quick Break” mode designed for live breaks — you can rapid-fire scan cards one after another and it keeps a running total of your break value. It’s completely free right now during launch. No credit card, no catch. I’m just trying to get feedback from actual collectors before I roll out paid plans. Would love to hear what you think. Drop a card name in the comments and I’ll run it through if you want to see how it works.",

Popular pokemon ✅ Full art, beautiful ✅ Low gem rate ✅ Very low risk of reprint ✅ Reminds me of the stamped charmander PC ETB promo but that has a way lower total population obviously... (and is worth 10x more than this) Calling this out before any buyouts for raws or slabs on tcgplayer and eBay. Personally I think sealed raws are the play here, as people crack them to grade. No booster box reprints coming for a while and reprints may or may not include more bulbasaur promos. Disclosure: I’ve got 2 x Psa 10, 18 x Psa 9 (from my own grading adventures) and about 30 raw sealed still 😀",

That said, I figured it would be a great opportunity to try to pickup up some Drake Maye cards at a “discount” from a crazy high prices from the past couple of months. So I started monitoring sales of his Prizm silver cards PSA 9 on eBay and I noticed a significant discrepancy in prices. All the cards in the screenshots are from sales today. Does anyone know why sales range as low has $189 to high as $292 despite all ending on the same day and all were auctions. Any clue? Are people trying to find the “best” cards and crack the for regrade? Thanks in advance for all replies.",

I bought these thinking that it would be a simple mystery graded slab from top grading companies that they mention in their description and the main website of this “company”. They mention PSA Beckett TAG “CGC” but what they don’t tell you is that “CGC” stands for “Cosmic Grading Company” which translates into them putting BULK value cards in a graded slab and grading the cards themselves. I sadly bought 6 total cards from these guys so I urge you to STAY AWAY!

          "text": "Most Expensive Graded Fusion World Cards (Feb 2026) The latest iteration in my “Most Expensive Fusion World” series: here are the most expensive GRADED Fusion World cards as of February 2026. I’ve done away with categorizing cards by set number as that only invited confusion and trolls, so the above represents the totality of Fusion World, including all booster boxes, Energy Markers and both Manga Booster Sets. Set and card number are indicated, as well as grade received (and from which grading company). Under the cards you’ll find the price the card was sold at, which does not include tax or shipping, as well as the sales date. All sales are from eBay. I also note whether the sale was sold at auction, at the listed price, or if a best offer was accepted. In the interest of keeping variety, I’ve included no duplicate cards in the list, (otherwise the list would just be a bunch of FP-001 sold listings ranked by sale price, which might be an separate and interesting future assignment). The only exceptions to this are FB01-139 and FB06-120, which both appear once as a BGS 10 Black Label and then once as a non-black label PSA/BGS 10. I found this to be a good illustration of the difference between a black label and a regular 10 for the same graded card. As always this is for informational purposes only. If it’s not useful or interesting to you, feel free to move on. **I’ve decided I may just start blocking folks who want to constantly rehash the “people like you are ruining the hobby” argument, when all I’m doing is reporting objective price data. That way they won’t ever see my hard work again which they claim is useless information to them in the first place**. But to the rest of you, enjoy, and happy to discuss anything shown here.",

My understanding is that their wait times have since exploded for their basic $1500.00 or less card value for $15.00 grading fee category, but I'm wondering about the $40.00 2-3 day turnaround deal. I've got approximately 10 cards I'd like to get graded quickly, and would be willing to pay the extra money to make that happen. Has anyone on here taken advantage of that sped up return time, and if so, how did it work out? Thanks.",

          "text": "I built a free tool to fill those annoying empty slots in your binders (and save ink) Hey everyone! 👋 Like many of you, I have a \"WIP\" binder that is full of gaps. I hate staring at those empty pockets while I wait to find the singles I need. I wanted a way to fill them with placeholders so the binder looks complete, but I didn't want to waste a ton of color ink printing full proxies just for a placeholder. So, I spent my weekends building a standardized tool for this. It’s called **Binder Placeholders**. It’s **free** and open to the community. 🔗 **Link:** [https://www.binderplaceholders.com/](https://binderplaceholders.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=launch_post&utm_content=r_pokemontcg) **What it does:** * **Printable Proxies (Eco-Friendly):** Generates perfectly sized card images. The \"Minimalist\" mode (my favorite) creates a clean, white card with just the Pokémon name, number, set symbol, and rarity—looks professional but uses zero color ink. * **Art Mode:** If you do want the full artwork for visual impact, you can simply toggle that mode on. * **Smart Binder:** A digital 9-pocket page editor where you can drag-and-drop cards to plan your layout before moving physical cards. * **Master Set Tracking:** Quickly browse sets (using TCGDex data) to find missing cards. * **Graded Slab Tracking:** If you have cards that are graded (PSA, BGS, CGC) and sitting in a slab box instead of your binder, you can mark them as \"Graded\" in the app. It will generate a special \"Slab Placeholder\" card for your binder that shows the Grade, Company, and Cert # so you know exactly where that card is. **Why I built it:** I absolutely love the E-Reader era and I'm currently slowly grinding my way through **Skyridge, Aquapolis, and Expedition**. Since those cards are harder to come by (and often graded), I needed a way to visualize the inevitable gaps in my binder without it looking empty. I’d love to hear what you think! Does it help with your organization? If you",

For context, here are my previous posts about this situation in order: 1️⃣ https://www.reddit.com/r/psagrading/s/TCUEw0xKG3 2️⃣ https://www.reddit.com/r/psagrading/s/zu3EhQ3lZN Quick follow-up: I stopped by the store today on a whim to ask if there were any updates on my PSA submission. The employee told me there still weren’t any — but then he mentioned the store is apparently closing in about a week and everything is getting transferred to another location. That honestly sounded like a worst-case scenario with my cards already stuck in limbo. So I basically pleaded with him and said I’d just eat the \\~$220 submission cost if he could give me my cards back. I think he realized how messy/unreasonable the situation was because he actually gave me my cards back on the spot — but I didn’t get any refund. I’m relieved to have the cards back, but I’m still out the money. Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Any advice on how I should try to pursue a refund (corporate, district manage, etc.), or am I probably out of luck. I paid in cash so I can’t charge back.",

Even during the worst of times around 2022 assembly was always a step that took a week at most. How does it make sense that I send a 5 card sub through Gamestop on the bulk tier and it takes 2 months, but I send 2 cards myself in value plus and it takes even longer than that I know they are the busiest company and grade a lot more cards than the 2nd but these times are honestly ridiculous. The fact that gamestop subs take less time than Value Plus completely killed it for me. I cancelled my PSA subscription and will only do GameStop from now on, makes no sense paying $150 a year to get treated purposefuly worse than the gamestop submissions I hope something is being done to throw these times down. This submission originally had an estimated finish date of 12/31. Then it got moved to /2/3 (today) and it obviously wont be done anytime soon Disheartening, disappointing, and just makes me not want to sub again. I know this is just a sob story and everyone is going through the same thing. But it really shouldnt just be accepted as the norm. Hope something changes",

          "text": "The Whale, the Trio, and the Warrant - The $100B Endgame **TL;DR:** We have entered the initiation phase of Gameshire Stopaway. GameStop is sitting on **$8.8B–$9B in cash**, has a CEO with a **$100B incentive structure** (scaling in $10B tranches) to reward performance, and a strategic **Bitcoin Treasury**. Between the eBay \"**Whale**\" thesis and the \"**Trio**\" roll-up (PSA/Funko/Newegg), RC is building a conglomerate. The **Oct ’26 Warrants (GME/WS)** are the surgical tool for high-leverage ROI, protected by a Board-controlled \"Extension Joker.\" # 1. The Financial Fortress: $9 Billion and a Bitcoin Floor As of late January 2026, GameStop’s balance sheet is an anomaly in the retail world. **\\[1\\]** * **The War Chest**: With \\~$9B in cash and liquid securities, GME is no longer defensive. It is a predator. This cash generates hundreds of millions in interest alone, ensuring consistent profitability even before a single game is sold. * **The Bitcoin Factor**: In 2025, GameStop moved to diversify its treasury into Bitcoin (averaging \\~$107k/BTC for 4,710 coins). **\\[2\\]** While BTC has seen recent volatility (consolidating around $79k), it provides a \"Hard NAV\" (Net Asset Value) floor. Crucially, GME recently moved its holdings to **Coinbase Prime \\[3\\]**, signaling they are preparing for maximum liquidity—likely to fund a massive, immediate cash acquisition. # 2. The $100 Billion Incentive: A Tranche-Based Roadmap On January 7, 2026, Ryan Cohen signed a performance-based stock option award that is 100% \"at-risk.\" This isn't a \"mandate\" to hit $100B overnight, but a highly structured reward system for long-term growth. \\[4\\] * The Tranche System: The award is broken down into nine distinct milestones. The first tranche only vests when GME hits a $20 Billion Market Cap and $2 Billion in cumulative EBITDA. Subsequent tranches vest in $10B increments until the $100B goal is reached. * The \"Buy-In\": This isn't a gift of shares. If RC performs, he earns the right to buy sha",

Once the news about the slabs being the weakest and easiest slabs to break as well as numerous evidence of card tampering and unreliable AI grading, people quickly stopped trusting the name, but somehow they are still making sales comparable, or even higher than PSA? If you search any popular modern card, you can see very few sales of TAG, but for some reason they are selling at similar prices. One of the shadiest things about TAG is their social media campaigning. Buying/sponsoring out popular influencers (DeepPocketMonster, RocketCollects, etc), sensational social media reels, etc is it possible that they are buying out overpriced slabs on eBay to look more \"presentable\" or as a legitimate competitor to PSA? I really feel like TAG is not given enough criticism for what can effect the market value of countless PSA investments",

If you think about it, those are the three pillars of the modern card market: grading (PSA), marketplace liquidity (eBay), and now retail + buying power (GameStop). If GameStop is serious about becoming a real player in collectibles, they have to understand live comps the same way we do — not book values, not guesses — actual sold listings. If GME can offer better fees than eBay, faster payouts, or easier trade-ins than dealing with random buyers, that’s huge. Most of us sellers would happily move volume there if the math works. Could be nothing. Could be the groundwork for GameStop quietly building a real collectibles ecosystem.",

I recently sold two high-value cards through Power Packs, which is directly integrated with PSA. • 2007 Jolteon – sold for $18,500 • Drake Maye – sold for $2,000 Total: $20,500. After the sales, PSA restricted my account. I was then told that due to “security and compliance policies,” they cannot provide details, cannot lift the restriction, and now claim they cannot see the transactions or card sales at all. Power Packs has also blocked my access because it’s tied to PSA. So at this point: • My cards were sold • The buyers exist • But I cannot access funds • And PSA will not provide documentation or a timeline I’ve formally requested written confirmation of: • Where the cards are • a copy of my transactions • Whether funds were received • And when they will be released So far, no clear answers. Has anyone here dealt with PSA compliance restrictions after a sale? Did you have to get legal involved? This is not a small amount of money and I’m trying to understand my options.",

I have a pile of various cards to grade from various sets and promos but I am having trouble deciding from a purely financial POV. My black label contenders will obviously be going beckett but for my clean but perhaps not perfect cards Im having the below pros and cons. TAG: Pros - 30 business day turn around,value seems to be competing with PSA on bigger slabs and theres a Pristine chance. Cons - Not as liquid as PSA and am not sure of value across the whole range of cardd. PSA: Pros - Easily most liquid, guarenteed value. Cons - Turnaround, upcharges. I think TAGs look better but that doesnt really matter when selling to market as PSA still is trumps. What are peoples thoughts? Im leaning towards TAG due to the faster turnaround, no upcharges and the chance of Pristine which seem to be selling between psa 10s and BLs but would welcome some advice/conversation.",

          "text": "Community PSA: a friendly reminder to slow down, avoid FOMO, and make wise financial choices. Silver has moved *extremely fast recently*. Depending on how you measure it, we’re up well over 200% in a relatively short period of time. **Moves like that should trigger caution, not urgency**. There is **no guarantee prices will stay this high**. There is **no guarantee silver will continue rising like this**. Parabolic moves almost always come with pullbacks. A word about FOMO **This is exactly how people get burned**. Rapid price increases create a fear that “this is the last chance” or that you’ll be priced out forever. That mindset leads to overpaying, overextending, or buying more than you can realistically afford. If you find yourself rushing purchases, ignoring premiums, dipping into emergency funds, or taking on debt because silver “can’t go down,” that’s a red flag. Markets don’t reward panic buying. If you’re stacking slowly, long-term, and within your means, that’s a different story. Just make sure decisions are intentional, not emotional. **Please avoid debt-fueled stacking** A gentle but important reminder: buying silver with credit cards, personal loans, or other high-interest debt is rarely a good idea. If you’re carrying high-interest debt, especially credit cards, that should almost always take priority over adding more metal. Paying down a guaranteed 18–30% interest rate is a far better “return” than trying to time a volatile market. If buying silver means: - Carrying a balance on a credit card - Taking out a loan - Tapping emergency savings then it’s probably worth slowing down and reassessing. **Don’t skip the fundamentals** Precious metals can be part of a broader plan, but they work best alongside a solid financial foundation.

I've been thinking of bidding on the complete set on the Goldin auction, mostly to display and hold myself, not necessarily for a return. Granted I'd probably sell it in 15-20 years. I'm not really good at valuing these things, I don't really collect anything at all, and don't understand the pokemon market as a whole. Really just the fact that we're at peak hype of Pokemon, especially with the 30 yr anniversary coming up. Do you guys have a general idea of what a set like this is actually worth? Is it foolish to try and buy it given all the hype right now, should I wait for it to die down and circle back in a couple years? Where else can I find complete sets like this? I'd be interested in probably Base Set, Fossil, and Team Rocket as those were like my peak years of participation in the hobby.

Insane to me. Feels very anti-collector to force somebody to pay more for the same service, especially when they may not intend to sell. Despite how maliciously vile and despicably greedy that is, I'm curious if that's ever a deterrent for you, whether you plan to sell or hold or PC no questions asked. The Kaboom just looks so clean and, if i'm getting premium service to avoid waiting 6 months for my card, then I have to pay 500 bucks just to get it back, i'm gonna be annoyed because I also have some fascination with the BGS black slab, and apparently they don't have that kind of fee. Any other drawbacks/benefits of BGS? Because it seems like PSA is the standard for sports? I see more BGS respect from TCG friends, but rarely see videos/comps of BGS slabs moving. And then I hear about all this PSA drama with the cracking slabs, employee scandals, fake grades, holding company acquiring BGS, yards-yadda-yadda... makes me think, damn, so they all corrupt? maybe i should just get one of those clear TAG slabs lol they look way cleaner than PSA. prob gonna get 7s anyway idek",

Just go with PSA as they allow some minor imperfections and won't take you from behind for not perfect centering that imo isn't even relevant for the condition the card is in but BGS weighs it just as much as it does the condition. It's just not worth it, the math is actually quite simple. Look at this poor f*cker getting 85% of his submission he waited 3 months for back as 9.5s of which most likely would've graded a PSA 10.",

At first I thought it I damaged the card but after looking at it for an hour I realized this was not caused by my fingers and that there was a surface issue on it. Centering is essentially 50/50 front and back, corners and edges are clean with no whitening. There is one small surface area on the black EX border where the holo sparkle density is lower (appears like missing sparkles). It is ONLY visible under very close flashlight / harsh angled light. No dent, no crease, no texture break, nothing visible under normal lighting. Trying to decide if this is still realistic PSA 10 territory or if this kind of factory holo inconsistency usually caps at PSA 9. Photos and short video included. Appreciate honest feedback.

Did PSA just stole my cards in daylight?? everything is sus to me. How can they lost something I handed to them in person??? I really want my cards back at this point.

          "text": "Hot Off London: Pikachu “At the Museum” Jumbo Card Release Heats Up—Is This the Next Big TCG Investment? London’s Natural History Museum just dropped a bombshell for Pokémon collectors—a limited-edition Pikachu Jumbo card, available exclusively at their massively hyped “Pokécology” pop-up shop. Tickets sold out in a flash, and from Jan 26–April 19, 2026, lucky fans will get the oversized Pikachu “At the Museum” card as a gift with purchase. Some quick context: * The artwork features Pikachu visiting the museum under a giant dinosaur skeleton, tying Pokémon’s world to real science. * This card is part of the official launch tie-in with the “Pokécology” book and features exclusive museum-inspired merch. * Can’t make it to London? A small number will hit select UK retailers from Jan 30, but no Pokémon Center stock and no regular online sales! * Profits from the museum shop support the Natural History Museum’s charity. Collectors are scrambling and fan forums are buzzing—some praise the art, some groan about scalpers being shut out (due to its size and accessibility), and others debate: Will this be the next Van Gogh Pikachu explosion or fizzle into another forgotten Jumbo? # But wait—is this actually a good investment, or just FOMO? Let’s break it down with a deep dive into the Jumbo card market and what makes this release unique: # 1. The Appeal of Jumbo Cards * Jumbo cards are typically non-playable, oversized promos—great as collectibles or display art, but not for tournament decks. * Standout art and links to notable events (like museum collabs or anniversaries) can make specific Jumbos highly sought after. * Older/vintage and low-print-run Jumbos have started commanding strong premiums, especially when PSA/BGS graded. # 2. Is This Pikachu Worth More Than Face Value? * Rarity: Pop-up event exclusivity, limited time window, and no global web release boost short-term hype. * Charitable tie-in (NHM profits) and cross-branding with a major museum add “story” and displa",

My card has not been charged still. I opted in for the 3 day service because I wanted the card back quickly. Ive sent a message through their online portal and have called them a multitude of times, and every time it's told me they're closed for the holidays even though online it says they are open. Never called on a holiday. Today I go to call them and surprise, their hours have changed! So now goes by another day waiting. It's been pretty frustrating so far. This is my first time grading with them as usually I use PSA. Anyone have any tips?",

          "text": "This is a brief tutorial on how to find PSA 10 candidates on eBay. Obviously this is a bit tricky, as there’s only so much you can see from photos. Here are some best practices: # 1. Focus On Centering and Corners Surface issues generally require the right lighting and angles to see. Edge issues generally require specific angles. Since centering and corners are the only things you can see well from pictures, we try to make sure everything we buy at least has good centering and sharp corners. # 2. Get the Right Pictures We will always ask for pictures of the card outside of both the top loader / mag and any penny sleeves. This helps us to see the surface as best we can. We try to avoid buying cards without these pictures. # 3. Ask Questions I’ll caution you to ask smart questions. Don’t ask a seller “do you think this is a 10?” But do ask about specific defects you’re unsure of, whether the seller pulled the card himself, or whatever else is relevant. # 4. Read the Descriptions The description sometimes will give you important context. Is the card pack fresh? Is there some issue you should know about? Always read descriptions before buying. # 5. Know Your Seller It’s impossible to do this perfectly, but we try to avoid buying from anyone who grades. The reason is that if someone is an experienced card grader, there’s a good chance *they are only selling ungraded cards that are* *unlikely to 10.* Sellers with high number PSA certifications on their profile likely have graded recently. For example, if a seller has the following certs... **13000000** **13000001** **13000002** **13000003** **13000004** ... then it’s probably best to assume the raw cards they’re selling won’t gem. Side note: we also try to avoid cards pulled from repacks, as we’ve found these often have small defects. # 6. Be Aware of Gem Rates Remember: **Gem Rate** **= PSA 10 Population / Total Graded Population.** Here is an example of gem rate data for the 2024 Drake Maye Silver Prizm #329, from the P",

I went to check the status a couple of weeks ago and they all are showing a graded serial number but no grade. Checked today and the same thing. I messaged two weeks ago and have heard nothing back. Does this mean they are just in a queue waiting to be graded? This is my first time ever sending out cards for grading and I’m not sure what I’m looking at. At the time of drop off they said it was 45 days turn around time. It’s been two months. Wanted to gift one of the cards to someone and am worried I’m going to miss the date.",

I reached out to customer service with photos, asking to be sent a replacement shadow. Their response was to offer compensation toward a future order instead. While I understand that replacements can be costly for businesses, I feel conflicted about this outcome since these palettes are quite expensive ($70+). At this price point, I do expect the product to arrive intact or that remedies for damaged items should not be contingent on placing another purchase. Genuinely want to support indie brands, but this experience has made me a bit hesitant about purchasing from international indie companies, especially when it comes to how damaged items are handled.",

          "text": "Just pulled a Red Manga Rare Luffy I’ve been collecting a bit on and off since the tcg started, but I went into a shop the other day and picked up 3 packs only to see this! I had no idea this rarity even existed and was initially disappointed it wasn’t the normal manga rare until I saw the price. How should I proceed from here? The back is 55:45 but everything else is as mint as it gets. I’d like to sell the card to try and get as much as possible. I’m based in Ireland which makes submitting for grading a bit more difficult than usual, and I’m hesitant to have this card be in the postal system. Is there much of a price difference between PSA and Beckett for One Piece? I think it would probably cost over €500 for me to grade it with PSA, whereas I can pay the more expensive Beckett tier for sub €200. I am considering grading and then selling through somewhere like Fanatics. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated!",

This time around I paid for the standard service and was curious how wait times are calculated. I submitted my list on 12/1/25 and shipped out same day. It arrived on 12/2/25 and I just received an email today 12/19/25 that they completed verification and will place my graded in queue depending on service I paid for. So does my 20/25 day wait time start now? Not when it arrived and got taking in to their system?",

I sent in one single card to be graded priority, and was invoiced for it over two weeks ago, but it still hasn't even started grading yet. What's the point in me paying for \"priority\" turnaround time, the fastest tier for 2-3 business days, if they're gonna take over a month do this anyway? I tried to contact customer service via email twice, the second time telling them to literally just ship my card back and refund my order cost, but complete silence from them. Am I supposed to just wait while they say and do absolutely nothing and wonder if my card even still exists or not? Anyone know how I might get someone to reply?",

Hey everyone 👋 It’s been a while since I last updated about the [PokePulse.io](http://PokePulse.io) ALPHA and figured some of you may be interested in how its progressing! (with mod persmission of course) The main goal’s still the same: the best platform for UK collectors using UK-only sold data for raw, graded, and sealed products. Tracking over 200k+ products now! Stuff that’s been added since my last update: * **AI card scanning** (raw, PSA, and ACE slabs) for instant prices — I’ve been using this myself at card shows as a buyer/vendor and it’s been solid * **Deal calculators** for buy / sell / trade * **Multiple portfolios** so you can split your collection up properly and track all purchases/sales you make * **Market analytics** (compare and trend UK market prices, growth, gem rates, grade pops, potential profit, etc.) * **Custom price alerts** * **Imports from Collectr**, eBay purchases, and CSVs * **CardMarket data** from UK sellers for sealed + raw cards (per condition) * **Vendor inventory tools** — still early, but a few vendors are already running parts of their business on it It's getting closer to beta now, and finally starting to look like the UK-focused market platform I wanted to exist for my own collecting and investing! Still loads more to do, and a big thanks to everyone who already uses it and helps with data and feature feedback ❤️ Happy to answer questions and hear what people want to see next (use invite code ALPHATEST at [https://pokepulse.io](https://pokepulse.io) if you want to give it a whirl) 👍",

          "text": "Don't use BGS Germany I've been grading cards since 2019 with BGS and have hit a 90%+ accuracy rate with my pre grades. Frankly, BGS Germany is like a brand new grading company and their standards do not match the ones set by the USA hub. I have sent twice and both times my cards have graded 1 to 1.5 less then my pre grades. To show their inconsistency I resent a vintage shadowless Pokemon Holo, (originally a PSA 9 new cert, which received a quad BGS 9 grade the first time I sent it in) which centering went from a 9 to a 10 (it was better than a 9, but still - how should the one objective subgrade change so much?). Another example is the pristine shining mew that was a PSA 9 new cert. How did it get a BGS 8.5 (8 surface is crazy, it was flawless)? The card is clearly also OC and I had sent it in assuming it would get a 9 centering grade - but it got a 9.5 which it shouldn't have. The shadowless 9++ Raichu is one of the cleanest Shadowless holos I've owned (I've graded 4 shadowless 9.5 holos, Blastoise and 3 raichus) and frankly deserves the bump. BGS EU didn't think so and was returned to me. I refuse to send more cards to BGS EU until I can see their grading is more aligned with BGS USA as it's just a waste of money at this point and 3 months waiting. All of these OP cards deserved higher graded imo. That being said, I see a lot of opportunity buying BGS 9.5s that were graded in the EU hub and cracking, sending to PSA or resubbed to BGS.",

PSA Cons: Reputation damaged due to recent buyback and regrade fiasco; atrocious turnaround times; up-charging on expensive cards that get a 10. Beckett Pros: Higher standards equals higher value on slabs that get a pristine 10; cheaper grading fees; quicker TAT; sub-grades allow for transparency; slabs look better (that's just my opinion). Beckett Cons: the dreaded 9.5 score is very common, and while many 9.5's can cross-grade to PSA 10's, the value isn't the same as a PSA 10.",

Got away from the hobby for about 15 years and got back into it 2 years ago at 32 years old when I found a couple boxes of my cards at my parents place. Nostalgia instantly kicked in and I started hunting for some of those players I collected as a teen and have been picking up some of their Bowman Sterling and Bowman Chrome prospect cards. At the time, my lawn mowing money pretty much limited me to base autos and refractors. Tyler Colvin was one of those players I collected. I had his Sterling base and refractor autos, ungraded. Upgraded those to BGS 9.5s. Found the BGS 9.5 black refractor about a year and a half ago. I was pretty content having those 3 and figured I'd never find the red refractor 1/1. Even the black refractors /25 are pretty tough to find from 2006. Last week I was adding some cards to my ebay store and decided to do a quick search for 2006 Colvin Sterling and BAM - the red 1/1 BGS 9.5 was staring back at me. The last time this card sold publicly was 2012! Couldn't believe it!",

I’ve seen some cards returned to people before with a label that says “do not holder” and some reason (evidence of altering, things like that), but this card just had its graded label stuck to a semi-rigid. I did reach out to PSA support so I’ll see what they say, just wondered if anyone else knew what the reason might be. It’s not a super valuable card, but not having it in a slab really removes any ability I have to sell/trade it as a graded card. Thanks Reddit! UPDATE: PSA sent me a label to send it back to them to review. So I might get it back in a slab. Just hope they don't drop it down a grade...",

But since a lot of people keep posting and asking, this'll break down what else you can try. **Why cant I find cards:** \\-2025 Popularity Surge and Price Bubble - Starting late 2024 Pokemon card popularity began to once again surge, with the surge came scarcity as product was unable to be fulfilled to meet demand. This unprecedented demand was met with surging prices as well beginning a ridiculous value increase spiral that has caught the eyes of not just the general public but also big money investors. The more money that gets focused into the hobby, the more people start to hear about it, and unfortunately the more people try finding opportunity to make money from others in the hobby. \\-Scalpers - These are the people who follow around card vendors, buy everything they can so that others cant get it, then flip it for 2x or 3x price. If you are dedicated and thorough you can make some serious money doing this BUT IT IS HIGHLY RISKY. One bad buy could tie up thousands and waste your time trying to sell. \\-Cardshops - In response to the popularity and scalpers, many shops have taken to raising prices themselves to take in as much profit while the market is hot. Some may be scalpers themselves hitting up stores to stock their own store, or they can be in cahoots with scalpers buying at just under market price to resell above market price since its still tough to find cards. Its a two way street that never benefits the general buyer. \\-Grading - You pay a company (hopefully reputable) to assess the condition of your card. This is usually done for 2 of the many reasons, protection or resale. Since factories are pumping cards out in a mad rush, quality control is terrible. If a card is assessed at Gem Mint condition (usually listed as a 10) then it is likely in the top percentage of condition for that card, this gives it a massive p",

          "text": "PSA 10 Sealed Pack Collection Ruined # Hey everyone, Never thought I'd be nervous posting something on the internet but here it goes! I’ve been collecting 1st Edition WOTC Pokémon booster packs (preferably unweighed) in PSA 10s, all artworks, building a uniform, sealed pack collection. Now I know most will think that I'm a moron based on most posts i've seen around here regarding sealed packs but I don't care. I have a vision in mind and I'm planning on framing them all onto my wall with the corresponding sets of cards under it which will make a great piece for my office space. It has taken many may hours, quite a bit of money, lots of driving around and years of networking with other collectors across Europe to make it possible. Recently as I was getting close to being finished collecting all packs I decided to have some of my older PSA-slabbed packs *re-holdered* into the new PSA holders to make the whole set match in display. Now I know this is Reddit and I'm not an idiot, I did my research before but hadn't found any record of people attempting this due to the way old slabs had the packs pushed into them. So before sending them in, I explicitly instructed PSA that if reholdering would require opening the slabs and risk regrading, they should *not* open them and simply return them in their original PSA 10 holders. Unfortunately, after 10 months of waiting I got a mail stating that PSA **ignored that instruction** entirely. They opened the slabs anyway, regraded the packs, and returned them to me as PSA 7s, 8s and 9s. Not a single PSA 10 remains of the old slabs. Even if the old slabs weren’t perfect, they were still PSA 10s, I could have kept them as-is, or even traded them with old-label collectors in exchange for new slabs. Obviously my heart sank when I received their apology email because they realised they made a mistake. I'm absolutely gutted to realise that a collection that took so much of me to collect is now just a mix of random packs worth basically no",

Does anybody have experience with PSA Japan and how long did it take to get your cards graded? I would only be getting this single card graded, so no large bulk shipment.

The only issue is that I move back to the Netherlands on January 23rd. The time listed on the website for regular and express is both 10 work days, but it also mentions a month long backlog. In other words, the timing will be very tight. Realistically, what are my chances for getting my graded card in time? Does anybody have experience with PSA Japan? On the other hand, if it doesn’t work out, I am planning on having it shipped to the Netherlands instead (which I believe is possible). The issue I am now facing is whether or not I would have to pay 21% VAT over the speculative value of the card, even though I am not buying it for that price but rather having my own card shipped to me. That would be a very heavy hit in combination with the PSA grading price itself. Ps: I have added some ugly photos of the card in case anyone would like to see it.

First off I thought it would be some hugeee space with a fancy reception area and a PSA grading sweatshop in the back. It was not. Instead it was just 2 really cool guys chilling that helped me out. Felt like I just entered a LCS. The space was small I mean real small like the size of a standard public washroom. From what I have seen online the grading process does NOT take place in Canada instead PSA Canada still operates as a middle man and sends it off to the US. I could not find some definitive information on this they imply it but don’t openly say “hey guys the grading process still takes place in the US.” Honestly huge bummer because the middle men I was using before was A. Cheaper ($32 per card with them) and ($40 per card with PSA) B. The other guys I was using didn’t even charge me for shipping to begin with. And C. If PSA grades in the USA the turnaround time should be about the same. (It took 73 days with the other guys... PSA tbd) Ultimately my question is this. Does anyone know if I’m wrong and the grading process does indeed take place in Canada? Thanks!!",

[Link to PSA post](https://www.psacard.com/articles/articleview/15625/updates-to-estimated-turnaround-times?j=694785&sfmc_sub=63982559&l=347_HTML&u=11607988&mid=534005128&jb=11&utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=PSA_20251120_PSA-M_PSATATUpdate&utm_term=Learn%20More&utm_id=694785&sfmc_id=63982559&%24web_only=true) I understand the high demand, but they need to be transparent about wait times as the current system is unacceptable and extremely deceptive. Value Bulk had a 60 business day wait time, which has been updated to 65. I sent in a submission expecting it to take 12 weeks, or \\~3 months to return and boy was I wrong. I sent in 26 cards the day before I left for college, Sep 2nd. Package arrived on the 5th, and PSA marked it as arrived Sep 9th. I expected these to be complete \\~ Early December. They then did not open my box until October 12th. My package had sat there for 5 weeks, and the 12-week countdown had not even begun. My submission has still not passed grading, and arrived at psa 79 days ago. It is expected to be completed on January 14th, but as we've seen PSA is quite often late and will not hit this deadline. A PSA submission, best-case scenario, will take longer than the entire semester of school. I understand high demand right now, and high wait times. However, claiming 65 business days while the actual expected date is 134 days away, and will likely be missed, is absurd and deceptive. I don't see how they continue to take express submissions for hundreds in grading fees, yet provide no clarity at all on the return speeds of normal submissions.",

I have a submission processing right now and I noticed something different when I got my grades revealed to me. After my grade reveal was done, PSA offered to buy my cards off me and gave me a 24 hour countdown to sell to them. Before this submission, my last order cleared in August and I got no such offer in the app or anywhere else. I can’t help but think that PSA, the company that grades cards, is intentionally downgrading certain cards with the hope that I’d sell to them, and they’d just regrade for a 10. I’m not a scrub. I did my due diligence of checking all cards and gently cleaning them before sending them out for grading. Boy was I surprised that only 8 out of 39 came back as 10’s. I can’t shake this feeling that there is an obvious incentive for PSA to screw me out of quality cards so they can auction it themselves in eBay. I dunno, maybe I’m overreacting. Am I crazy in thinking this?",

Meanwhile GME is over here building: • a marketplace • a grading pipeline • a distribution loop • and now a multi-sport collectibles ecosystem ...all with PSA smiling and delivering product straight into it like a UPS driver in heat. But yeah, tell me again how “fundamentals don’t support it.” Because the only fundamentals I see are: 💎 PSA partnering deeper 💎 more IP 💎 more categories 💎 more revenue streams 💎 and a collectibles market bigger than some entire sectors of the S&P.

The stock has gone up and down and is currently at a relative low point. I just want to make some bullet points on why I am bullish as ever, hold more shares than I ever have, and why I'm completely comfortable buying and holding into 2026: - Ryan Cohen and the board have continually bought and held shares. We added a new board member from PSA Nat Turner and hopefully we see his buy soon, he can get in at a nice low price currently - In 2021 GME hit $120 (or more depending on broker) before brokers turned off the buy button. Since then GameStop has went from losing money to making money and having $9 billion in assets. I expect to break that price point - Last earnings shareholders were given a warrant dividend on their shares, strike price of $32. It educated us on derivatives, will make GameStop some more cash as long as GME exceeds $32 by next Halloween, and makes shareholders money if they choose to sell or execute. I would guess that next earnings we could receive another - GameStop moves quietly, they just released a physical videogame for GameBoy and Retromod called Buck and the Cursed Cartridge, game looks fun and inventive. Ryan Cohen is cooking behind the scenes and told us to judge him by his actions not his words. GameStop will post even better earnings this quarter from PowerPacks revenue, PSA grading, and collectibles - Roaring Kitty used to stream talking about console cycles, Nintendo Switch 2 just released and will make GameStop some nice profits from those sales. We have seen the lines outside stores, GameStop is still a hub for gamers - DFV could still update us on a YOLO post since we saw he had 9,001,000 shares last post, but it would be interesting to see his share count including warrants or maybe new calls bought. There is no reason to believe he is not still holding, he tweeted all las",

Need PSA/Card Grading Tips! 🕵️♂️ I was incredibly lucky and managed to acquire 59 copies of the Coffee Break Detective Pikachu promo card. They are all in pristine condition—they've only been handled twice: once to open and once to immediately put them into storage. I've done some research and see a PSA 10 copy can sell for around the $400 range, which has me excited! I believe a large majority of my copies would grade highly, but I'm completely new to the process and need some guidance before I send them in. ❓ My Grading and Shipping Questions PSA Service Levels: I looked at the PSA website and saw different prices for submission. What is the actual difference in service for a higher price? Is it just the turnaround time (how fast they grade them) and the Max Declared Value for insurance/upcharge purposes? I'm only looking to get the cards graded, so I'm not sure which price tier to choose. Trial Submission: I'm planning on submitting a small batch (2 or 3 cards) first to get a feel for the process and see what grades I get back before sending in the rest. Does this sound like a good strategy? Grading Company (PSA vs. Others): Is PSA still the undisputed \"go-to\" and best value-maximizer for modern Pokémon cards? Are there other companies like CGC or BGS that the community prefers, and why? Shipping/Protection (Immediate Concern): This is my most urgent question! I currently do not have penny sleeves or card savers/toploaders. For a temporary solution until I can buy proper supplies, I'm currently using a makeshift method: Placing each card inside the smallest sandwich bag I have. Sandwiching the bagged card between two 5x5-inch pieces of cut-out cardboard. Securing the cardboard with rubber bands in a cross-pattern. Is this an acceptable temporary storage/shipping method to prevent damage while I wait for proper supplies to arrive? I'm worried the rubber bands might be too tight. 💰 Post-Grading: Wh",

          "text": "I do not understand the pricing of this card The 2009 Charizard Cracked Ice holo from the Platinum Arceus set has interesting pricing. From what I understand, the price is so low because it was offered as a promo card in a tin. However, even though it was a card you could simply purchase in a tin, after 16 years, it still only has a PSA 9 population of 229 and a PSA 10 population of 26. On top of that, up until 3 weeks ago, the price of a PSA 10 was only about $1200, until 2 weeks ago when one was suddenly sold in an Ebay auction for $9300. PSA 9 is still going for around the $200 mark. It's obvious that this card is highly illiquid and not very sought after, but I'm just wondering why that is, and if someone can explain to me why it's so cheap in a PSA 9, and why the population is so low even though the card was readily available for purchase in a tin?",

Question: Should I crack and resend, or resend for review? For context — I’ve been submitting cards for grading for a while and I’m pretty strict about what I send in. My pre-grading standards are tough, and so far I’ve had about a 92% PSA 10 rate out of 103 total cards I’ve submitted. I know that’s not a massive number for some, but I’d say I’m fairly confident in my eye for grading. Recently, I sent in the card as shown in the pictures. The grader notes mentioned a dent along the right side (no specification if it was on the front or back). After checking it myself, showing it to a few friends and vendors who grade regularly, and even having Beckett take a look — everyone agreed there’s no dent at all. I even checked it under a blacklight and found nothing. I’ve helped friends crack and resend cards before, but I’ve never personally done a review submission — where you send in the slab as-is for PSA to reassess it. So... what would you do? Crack and resend, or send for review? Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with similar situations.",

The person that I submitted the order with had a spare card-saver iv that I was switching the card in to but he said it's fine to leave in the toploader. But the toploader isn't listed in the email as a possible violation, and I've seen PSA say themselves that thick cards are fine to send in toploaders instead of card-savers.

          "text": "PSA - Don’t shill bid I recently bid on an item after asking the seller a question. The seller answered my question and also said they were hoping for the auction to get bid up higher because they would only make a few dollars if it sold for the starting bid. I thought that was weird but didn’t think much about it again until a few hours before the auction ended, an account with 0 feedback started bidding on the item. I was immediately suspicious and stopped bidding. The account with 0 feedback won the auction. To no one’s surprise, the seller just relisted the same item a few days later with a higher starting bid. I can’t find a way to report them so I just blocked them and won’t buy from them, but PSA if you are a seller, shill bidding is FRAUD and it’s ILLEGAL.",

          "text": "After 11 months of teaching myself to code, I launched SlabTrack - AI-powered sports card collection manager Hey everyone! 👋 I'm a former dentist who taught myself to code and just launched my first SaaS product on Product Hunt today. **What is SlabTrack?** An AI-powered collection manager for graded sports cards (PSA, BGS, SGC). It solves the pain of tracking card values, organizing collections, and staying on top of market trends. **Key Features:** - AI scanning with 95%+ accuracy (snap a photo, instant identification) - Real-time eBay pricing integration - Batch scanning (upload 50+ cards at once) - Price alerts when cards spike - Reddit buzz tracking - Works with all sports + Pokemon TCG **The Journey:** Started knowing zero about coding. Went through multiple pivots (trading platform → platform generator → fantasy sports → back to cards). Every step taught me something I needed for the next. Built the entire stack myself: React frontend, Node backend, Claude AI integration, Stripe payments, all of it. **Tech Stack:** - Frontend: React, Tailwind - Backend: Node.js, Express - Database: PostgreSQL - AI: Claude Vision API - Hosting: Railway + Vercel Would love your feedback! We're live on Product Hunt today: https://www.producthunt.com/products/slabtrack?utm_source=other&utm_medium=social Happy to answer any questions about the journey or the tech! 🚀",

The only thing wrong with this card is the centering on the back is off right to left. I’ve taken this to card shops and to sports card conventions and the dealers who I’ve talked to who also grade cards have all said that this would be a minimum 8.5 on the grading system, just because the centering on the back. I’ve held onto this card since I got it in a pack when I was a freshman in high school in 79-80 waiting to sell it. It looks like a defect on the top but it’s the lighting and reflection. The edges are all clean, the colors are still bright, it’s centered on the front almost perfect. There are no spots. I’m just devastated with this grade. Do you think the graders were just having a bad day? I just don’t get it, especially comparing these images with the cards that have sold on Heritage auctions with some of the issue they have like centering which had much higher grades than this.

          "text": "Bought a Fake Card Through eBay’s Authentication Guarantee – eBay Refusing to Help Hi all, I recently purchased a Pokemon card on eBay that was covered under their Authentication Guarantee program. The card was authenticated by PSA and arrived sealed in the tamper proof packaging. However, upon inspection, it's clear that the card is a fake, (Static holo pattern, holo matches with TCGPlayer, 1st Edition stamp is not lined up properly) despite PSA marking it as authentic. I did not do my due diligence prior to purchasing due to it being through the Authentication Guarantee, now I wish I should have. I contacted eBay immediately. They redirected me to another department and unfortunately, they refused to offer a return or refund. Their reasoning was that they trust PSA’s authentication process and won’t override it, even in the case of a clear mistake. Here’s where I currently stand: * I’ve contacted PSA directly and am awaiting their response as they review the case. * The card remains sealed in its tamper proof packaging - I haven’t opened it to ensure the chain of custody is intact. * I'm considering a chargeback as a last resort, but I'd prefer to explore all possible avenues before going down that road. It’s frustrating that eBay’s authentication program which is supposed to protect buyers seems to leave no room for recourse when the authenticator gets it wrong. And ironically, PSA’s involvement has limited my ability to open a standard claim under eBay’s Money Back Guarantee. Any advice on next steps, other contacts, or how to escalate this situation? Thanks in advance.",

It's an AI-powered collection manager for card collectors. **The Problem:** I collect sports cards and Pokemon cards. Managing everything in spreadsheets was a nightmare - manually typing card names, looking up prices, trying to track portfolio value. **The Solution:** SlabTrack uses AI to scan ANY card (graded or raw) and automatically: - Identifies the card (95% accurate) - Pulls live eBay pricing - Organizes your collection - Tracks portfolio analytics **Works for:** - Graded slabs (PSA, BGS, CGC) - Raw cards - Sports cards (all major sports) - Pokemon cards **Free tier:** 7 scans/month, no credit card required **Paid plans:** Start at $4.99/mo Link: slabtrack.io Would love to hear feedback from fellow builders!",

I might be biased since I love BGS slabs and the level of detail they put into grading, but why does almost every PSA 9 (or below) outperform its Beckett equivalent in value? Why can’t a BGS 9 be worth the same? In many cases, the price gap is surprisingly big. I feel BGS 9.5 should be closer to PSA10 in price. Also, is it true that BGS tends to grade vintage cards more favorably than PSA? I’ve seen a lot of comments from collectors saying PSA is harsher on vintage stuff. Curious to hear your thoughts or experiences.",

Has anyone ordered through them? Hopefully it’s true. They are a massive seller with 99.9 positive feedback. Also - I wanted to share this, what I consider a little hack. They charge 24.99 to ship - which from China makes sense...SO, generally you can buy auctions for at least 25 less than you would normally, plus even less because the shipping turns additional people away and a lot of people don’t want to wait a month for cards. BUT you can combine shipping for 1 dollar additional per card. So here’s the hack. There are a ton of cards that start their bid at 99 cents. They might be a 5 or 6 dollar Jordan - but no one is paying 25 bucks to ship that card. So you can bid on your main card - for instance I just bought a Joe Montana PSA 7 card for 75 bucks less than I can sell it for. And now I’ll add like 10 additional 1 dollar cards for 10 bucks shipping. And the card will value probably 60 to 70 bucks!",

Packages are sitting **6–8 weeks before intake even opens the box**, and the 20-day clock only starts after that. Add in the recent price increase and we’re paying more for slower service. If submission volume is high, that’s an operational challenge the company should solve by staffing and paying graders appropriately, not by shifting the delay onto customers. Reasonable fixes: 1. Start the turnaround timer at **delivery scan**, not “box opened.” 2. Publish **real, rolling TATs** that reflect the full wait from delivery. 3. **Credit or partial refund** for orders exceeding the posted 20 days measured from delivery. Collectors shouldn’t be losing time and market value while fees go up. Align the promise with the process or compensate the difference. **ChatGPT drama is noise. Start the clock at delivery, publish intake + grading stats, and stop hiding behind vague disclaimers. Consumers deserve to know where their assets are and for how long. If AI offends you, don’t use it. It’s 2025. Facts don’t change because a tool wrote them.** Not an anti-PSA rant, just a transparency issue. Through August my Value Plus orders averaged \\~30 days and Value Max \\~25. September suddenly ran far longer with no notice. Had I known intake might take 2+ months just to open the box, I wouldn’t have sent them. During a delay that long, anything can happen to the cards, and PSA will grade them as-is. [https://www.psacard.com/info/submission-delays](https://www.psacard.com/info/submission-delays) Fees up. TATs up. Intake = black box.

(She's 9yrs with cancer now) Adopted my German Shepherd, Pixel, in 2016. When i came home one day after work she had gotten into a stack of cards I had left on the table the night before. She went absolutely bonkers on the cards. No many survived but Jirachi did! Its my favorite pokemon and i was excited to get the shiny card, so i was PRETTYYYY upset when i came home that night. I never bothered replacing it for my collection and kept the chewed up card. It came back graded as an absolutely ***GLORIOUS*** PSA3. I couldnt be happier. This week she goes in for surgery (enucleation) so this card coming back today is a good sign of a quick recovery. Teeth marks in the pics and a photo of the culprit!",

          "text": "Unable to pickup psa graded cards from my local store Hey everyone, I honestly didn’t know where to post this because I am honestly so lost so here I am. I sent in some pokemon cards to be graded through my local GameStop and was told it would take about 2.5 months to turnaround and come back. The problem started when my pro account attached to the submission was deleted and I was told it can’t be restored, it’s been over three months since I sent my cards in to be graded and they came back to the store around a month to a month and a half ago, the store says they cannot give me any of my cards because the submission no longer exists. They first told me they had to get clearance from psa (which never happened) and then told me they could transfer the submission over to another account so they could mark the cards as picked up. I was told the transfer to the other account would take around 48 business hours and it’s now been about 3 weeks since that conversation. I’ve tried calling them to discuss any other steps we could take but have been met with lukewarm responses or a “sorry there is nothing we can do”. I have honestly ran out of patience and would really just like the cards I submitted and got graded back. Is there anything I can do as the customer and owner of the cards? TLDR: I submitted my cards over 3 months ago and I’m not allowed to pick them up, what should I do?",

          "text": "2024 Championship Stamped Zoro (P-042) Saw a write up here by someone of another card from the CS2024 series. Although there’s a few nice ones from the 24 Series, I’m a big fan of the gold stamped Zoro promo and I believe them to be very slept on especially for an extremely popular character from the Straw Hats. The art is unique and has a nice textured finish (though there’s an even nicer Finalist version). The gold foil on the stamp is a nice premium touch and the card really pops in person, which is why I think people will opt for this version over the one without a stamp. I think this one is going to do well short term and long term. Grading wise, there is currently not one Black Label submission for this card (I’m hoping to fix that) although only 23 have been subbed to Beckett - one person got a 6.5 lol. PSA pop count is only 74 total which is crazy for a unique art of one of the most popular characters but with the recent buyout I think this will slowly creep up. Recently there’s been a few sales with people paying well over market for this on eBay and there’s only 11 left on TCG Player but some are overpriced. Cardmarket as usual lag behind with trends so take advantage of that marketplace if youre in the EU! (Note: the guy on Cardmarket with the card at €4 is the non stamped version) I have one copy already but will be picking a few more of these up and trying for the Beckett Black Label which would be the very first ever! Longshot here but if anyone has sealed finalist packs from the 2024 series please reach out! I ripped my one hoping for the Zoro but now want another sealed one back in the collection. Cheers all and happy collecting!",

          "text": "Hey everyone, I recently bought a Giratina Pokémon card on Whatnot. After receiving it, I had it physically authenticated by PCA (Professional Cards Authenticator), a trusted grading/authentication company in Europe. 👉 PCA officially confirmed in writing that the card is a counterfeit. I have the certificate from them proving this. However, Whatnot’s Trust & Safety team replied to me saying the card is authentic because they checked it using LegitApp – an app that only reviews photos, not the actual card. They are ignoring the PCA attestation and refusing to process my refund. This is extremely frustrating, because: PCA examined the card physically, not just a picture. Whatnot is relying on a mobile app over a recognized professional authenticator. I’m now stuck with a fake card and no refund, unless they reconsider. Has anyone else here dealt with similar issues with Whatnot? What are the best next steps – pushing again with PCA’s document, contacting my payment provider, or escalating legally? Thanks in advance for any advice – I don’t want other collectors to get scammed the same way.",

I asked where the price point is coming from, as last solds on Ebay are between £110-£120 / $150-$160. He said he uses Collectr app for pricing. So i went on Collectr app, and its valuing the TAG10 on there at £90 / $120. So, i asked where the $200 counter offer price point is coming from. The above was their response. For reference, its valuing the PSA10 at $175. Am I missing something or is this insane?",

The card returned a PSA 8 and with a line on the card that was not there pre shipment. The card is now up for auction. Has anyone had experiences like this with Goldin and if so, what was your course of action and remedy? My rep is slow playing me and when he responds, it's not to my specific questions.

          "text": "No Update or Refund on Missing Beckett Grading Services Card Submission After a Whole Year. [Advice] Hey all, As the title suggest I submitted card for grading through Beckett Grading Services (BGS) and have not heard anything about them in almost a year despite me talking to multiple customer service representatives to work and try to resolve this issue. I will try to refrain from insulting BGS throughout this post. Back in October of 2024 I submitted my first round of cards to get graded. I decided to grade though BGS since they were attending a local con near me and it would be easy to submit in-person with first party BGS reps. I submitted 11 cards from the Stellar Crown set paid in-person for the base service w/subgrades and insurance. **December 2024:** I saw my order appear through the website and listed as \"pending\" so i assumed that they were received and in the process of being graded. **February 2025:** I emailed customer service and they said I had an outstanding balance on my account despite me already paying in person. I provided receipts and order form. They assured me that they would locate my order. and get back to me. **# of** **BGS reps investigating order : 1** **March-April 2025:** I submit multiple customer service tickets that receive no reply. Eventually my order disappears off the BGS website all together. I write multiple customer service tickets to BGS asking for an explanation but crickets. **May 2025:** I attend another con where BGS is in attendance and go and talk to a sales rep attending and explained the situation. The sales rep was able to confirm my order but was not able to explain what had happened to my order. The sales rep gave me their contact info and assured me they would investigate my order personally. **# of** **BGS reps investigating order : 2** **June 2025:** I email back and forth with the sales rep and they assure me that they are initiating a refund and that another customer service rep will me looking into my order ",

          "text": "PSA 6 turned PSA 10??? PSA I need clarity. Months ago I submitted a Zekrom & Pikachu Tag Team promo. At the time of submission, the card was worth around $550-$600 in a 10. Weeks after I sent it in, the explosion of tag teams happened and this card over doubled in price to $1400 in a 10. Being super pumped that my card was going to be a lot more than it was when I submitted it. I couldn’t wait for it to be finished. Time goes by, I received report that my card got a 6. I thought there was absolutely no way that could be true. When I received the card I immediately broke it out of the slab and examined it under a very expensive microscope for literally 2 hours straight. Nothing. Just a virtually “perfect” card to PSA’s standards. (Btw on the pics, the black spec on the back is not actually on the card) I made a post questioning why it got a 6 and said I’d be resubmitting for a 9-10. Fast forward to today, I got the report back. GEM MT 10. Nothing about the card was changed or altered. It’s the same exact card that received as a 6. The price is now down $350 from what it was a month and a half ago when I received it initially. As an effect of their “misjudgment”, I missed out on good money, (selling amount and grading fees). This submission was expedited. So in total, I’ve spent $100 on grading just this card alone. I’m severely unhappy with their judgement. As a long time PSA user, I’ve had multiple inconsistencies with them in the last 4-5 months. For the time being, I will no longer be using PSA. 100% Perfect cards will go to BGS, Near perfect cards will go to TAG. I understand TAG is very new to Pokemon and is still working on a lot of things. I will be experimenting with them. But it’s really about clarity and seeing what’s wrong with my card. Rather than getting told my card is a 6 and to give them money. Guess what? They paid me $1,017 for the same exact card they told me was “valued at $86”!",

          "text": "Pokémon card prices have reached an absurd level. A Pikachu Illustrator card was just sold on eBay for $4 million! These cards are considered the rarest of all Pokémon cards – they were released in 1998 as a prize for the winners of a contest in Japan, with a print run of just 41 copies. These days, the price of cards depends on their condition, and the one just sold graded a PSA 9, which is very close to perfect (PSA 10). It's worth noting that just a week ago, the exact same card in the same condition was sold for \"only\" $625,000. And it should be added that four million for a Pokémon is still not a record, as in 2022, the -popular vlogger Logan Paul paid $5.25 million for an \"Illustrator\" card. That card, however, was in perfect condition. >More about games in our community.

Searching sold listings will give you accurate comp prices that people are actually paying. **1/1 cards** For 1/1s you need to research card sales from the same player. Look for other 1/1 cards with similar traits like brand, year, league, patch/auto etc. Then set a relative price yourself. \\---- Bookmark some of these helpful guides: **Determine the value of your trading cards** [https://sundocards.com/resources/determine-the-value-of-your-trading-cards/](https://sundocards.com/resources/determine-the-value-of-your-trading-cards/) **How to value your trading cards** [https://sundocards.com/how-to-value-your-trading-cards-a-beginners-step-by-step-guide/](https://sundocards.com/how-to-value-your-trading-cards-a-beginners-step-by-step-guide/) **Should I hold or sell?** [https://sundocards.com/resources/trading-cards-should-i-hold-or-sell/](https://sundocards.com/resources/trading-cards-should-i-hold-or-sell/) **Should I get this card graded?** [https://sundocards.com/resources/should-i-get-this-trading-card-graded/](https://sundocards.com/resources/should-i-get-this-trading-card-graded/) **Guide to PSA grading** [https://sundocards.com/resources/guide-to-psa-card-grading/](https://sundocards.com/resources/guide-to-psa-card-grading/) **Guide to refractors, parallels and foils** [https://sundocards.com/resources/the-complete-guide-to-types-of-parallels-refractors-and-holographic-hologram-trading-cards/](https://sundocards.com/resources/the-complete-guide-to-types-of-p",

          "text": "Just wanted to share my negative experience with \"Break'n Bad\" on fanatics live as an FYI to others. Since July I have spent over $925 with that shop purchasing various online cards breaks including one where I paid a little over $37 for a Topps Chrome Jumbo pack. I received the package on time but it only contained cards pulled from other orders I placed with them and no Jumbo Pack (I did receive a second Jumbo Pack I bought in a separate purchase/shipment just fine the same week). I messaged them through the fanatics site, got a couple replies including \"our shipping team may have just missed including that pack\", but its now been a week with no follow-up or resolution from them. I just filed a complaint with Fanatics, hoping they can help get this resolved, but its a let down to spend that much money with someone only to end up getting ignored when things go wrong. That's not the customer service someone would expect when a company drops the ball. Until this point, my experience with them was otherwise positive, but when someone doesn't fix their mistake that's a deal breaker for me, so I will not be purchasing again from them and will likely stop the whole site altogether, if fanatics can't make it right. Update 9/16/25: I filed a claim with Fanatics-live as previously stated (who responded very quickly) and received an update from the shop shortly thereafter (not sure if it was cause-and-effect or not). Just got a replacement jumbo pack from the shop, so they did ultimately make good on their end. Overall, its good to see both the shop and fanatics provide resolution, but it did unfortunately result in having to jump through several extra hoops on my side.",

I was discussing the card with the PSA rep and we were talking about whether it graded as a 10. While he obviously couldn't guarantee anything. He thought the card looked like it could be a 10 because he saw nothing wrong with it after inspecting it closely. I get the card back and it's an eight and the all four corners are damaged. Obviously upset I didn't reach out to PSA but I should have. I recently submitted a jumbo Paul Skenes autographed card and it comes back looking like it was drug through gravel on the top edge with smudges. And then I look at the bottom left corner and the case looks like it was smashed against the ground. The crazy thing is the box didn't look damaged enough to where this could have happened while it was in the box during shipping. WTF PSA... Anyone experience this? I will never get something graded by PSA again! UPDATE: I received an email from a customer care agent at PSA asking me to resubmit my claim under Quality Assurance Request. I originally submitted it under Outbound Sending Loss.",

So obviously i cracked it out, inspected the card for a good 10 minutes and knew in my heart this was a 10. So i resubmitted at the express tier and sure enough it gets the 10. Its ridiculous that i had to pay $40 more plus shipping for the grade i deserved. Psa, EXPLAIN YOURSELF! Btw if you look at the bottom left silver border on the front of the card youll see a little dot thats there on the card, so you can tell it is the exact same card lol. Maybe that was the reason it got a 5 originally but i cant see a problem that small bringing from a 10 to a 5",

She was not working due to a pregnancy and identified that issue to Sallie Mae, a forbearance was declined as she was on a modified payment plan. I assume this loan accelerates. Does anyone have experience with work outs with Sallie Mae? As a PSA, we have sent many kids to college - never work with Sallie Mae.

These include scarcity, condition sensitivity, the historical significance of the player and card issue, and overall market trends. **Rarity and Population Reports** Rarity is paramount in determining a card's value.Cards with extremely low production runs, error variations, or those that have simply survived in limited numbers over time command a premium. Population reports from grading services like PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) and SGC (Sport Guaranty Corporation) provide valuable details on the number of cards graded at each level, offering insights into scarcity and overall condition distribution.

But I haven’t seen anything recent since PSA is being investigated by the FBI and Beckett’s CEO getting in trouble for something in November of 2024. PSA seems to be wishy washy depending on the graders mood. CGC sounds ridiculously strict. And BGS sounds great if your card is PERFECT. So I basically have it boiled down to going with BGS or PSA. But my worry is their authenticity in grading. I don’t want to send a sure thing to PSA and get a 9 cuz the grader hasn’t gotten laid in months. But I don’t want to send to BGS if they’re gonna screw me over either. Idk I guess I just need help? I really wanna do research before sending my first cards in.",

ATM I am trying to get back into the game with sports cards starting with Panima NBA cards with Prizm and Totally Certified right now and considering using eBay right now. This is my plan: 1. Try to get Hobby boxes sometimes retail packs or boxes every month, not like real expensive.. no more than and less than $200 a month. 2. Trying to buy hobbys or retails without getting whole bunch of extra junk cards. Junk cards I consider are ones that has no real value and just takes up space. 3. Get good ones that I see that has been selling for good prices get PSA graded. 4. Known names that has been playing that sells well in the market with same cards like ones I have now LeBron James, Kevin Durant get them graded, go long term invest.e t then prob sell those in 20 years or after they retire and go to HOF. 5. Keep 2024-25 rookies I have now for long term investment growth in case they stand out within next 5 years., get em PSA graded if their stats meets my standards like All-Star appearances, awards, etc.. 6. Right now try to eBay sell the cards I don't want to keep(like my junk cards), may have to throw in deals like buy one get one free deals, sleeves, cases,, etc.. -This will also be a good way to for me to setup an eBay store, maybe one day turn it into a real LLC online business, who knows.",

For collectors and investors alike, navigating this landscape requires careful consideration of card rarity, condition, patch quality, and overall market trends. Kobe Bryant's legendary career and tragic passing have significantly fueled the desirability and value of his cards, especially those containing game-worn jersey pieces. Identifying undervalued or promising cards now can possibly yield meaningful returns in the coming years as his legend continues to solidify. [[Explore Top Rated kobe bryant jersey card on amazon.]](https://best.healthytargeting.com/clearance-products/?kw=kobe bryant jersey card) ## Key Features analysis The kobe Bryant jersey card market is diverse, including cards from various manufacturers, such as Panini, Upper Deck, and Topps. Each card boasts a unique combination of features, contributing to its value and collectibility. **Rarity:** the print run,which signifies the quantity of a specific card produced,is a critical factor. Cards with limited print runs, such as those numbered to 25 or less, are generally more desirable and command higher prices. Rarity can also be determined by the specific jersey patch included, such as a multi-color patch versus a single-color patch. **Patch Quality:** The size, colors, and distinctiveness of the jersey patch embedded within the card dramatically influence its appeal. Multi-color patches, logo patches, and patches featuring notable elements of Bryant's uniform tend to be more coveted. The presence of team logos or special event symbols on the patch significantly elevates the card's value. **Grading:** Professional grading services",

I now realize that there are two keys to realizing that this is a fake. First, this fake label pretends to be generation 8 label, but the real generation 8 label doesn’t have this PSA logo on the top of the label. This PSA logo is bolder than the real one, and I suspect a scammer made it according to generation 9 label(the PSA logo of generation 9 is bolder than the one from generation 8). Second, generation 8 label doesn’t have this type of holder. As far as I know, PSA began to use this type of holder with generation 10 label. But the holder itself doesn’t look fake. So I think the scammer reused the real holder to make this. As I said above, it took me a lot of knowledge and time to realize this was a fake, so I post it to share with other collectors and want to help them avoid fakes. Thanks for reading.",

I personally won’t be bothered if they don’t because the slab themselves are very high quality and great for collectors! Also what do we think about the CZ Glaraian trio in terms of long holds?

A couple months pass and the grades pop, all except one card A J.J McCarthy Silver Prizm Auto (card #46 on the scan in photo), about a $1k+ card in a 10. Thought not a huge deal shit happens - I get it. I start the process of contacting them to figure out what happened about a month and a half ago, kept getting the workaround “we’ll look into it” after contacting them multiple times. Today they email me a scan of the grade sheet you include with the order that lists all the cards. They’re saying I SCRATCHED OUT THE NAME OF THAT CARD AND WROTE BRYCE YOUNG OVER IT?? Lol. Not even my handwriting. Seems to me someone at PSA either stole my card or fucked up and trying to cover their asses. Anyone ever deal with anything like this? They seem to be refusing to take responsibility even tho the card was clearly scanned in upon arrival.",

          "text": "I want to preface by saying I empathize with those of you who have gotten ripped off on TCGplayer purchases. It’s happened to most of us by now. I am sure all reading this are aware that TCGplayer is very problematic in 2025 and you have a high chance of getting screwed nowadays. Just happened to me too, I ordered a display of 1st edition Yugioh decks and received 2 loose decks instead of 10 shrinkwrapped, a roughly $700 delta between what I paid for and what I received. I am not sure why everyone seems to think this is the place to complain when your TCGplayer purchase goes wrong? Why not the tcgplayer subs or the main magic sub? This sub was much more useful and interesting when it was discussing card and sealed specs, online sales/shipping discussion and strategy, card investments and portfolios, ya know mtg finance stuff. Nowadays its reading like a TCGplayer complaints box and I don’t think it’s very constructive for us to be naming and shaming unscrupulous sellers one at a time, which will achieve approximately nothing, when really the whole platform should be boycotted so they adopt better policies and protections for both sides. Not to mention their seller interface is still basically 90s internet, which is why I haven’t sold there for years. Anyway I love you all fellow mages just want to see the quality of this sub back to what it was, and to stop seeing yall get ripped off, so lets take our business to another platform! Thanks for reading EDIT: I forgot to mention in the original post that the actual data on problematic sellers can be useful if properly organized into a sheet, I made that sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ETZRIbg7_68_W44ozD7MromwudIRucRPpUCwtpOXXI/edit?usp=drivesdk). I suggest we link this on the FF scam posts so we can accrue something meaningful out of these negative experiences.",

Probably no surprise to you all, but the difference between the quality in the EBay listing photos & the photo PSA took before grading was pretty significant. I started to worry I would get a bad grade so I’m taking my 9 and running. The silver lining is, albeit for one card, this was fast as hell. 12 days from purchase to completed grading - I imagine the EBay pipeline helped with that. A couple people commented their turnaround time was lighting when they used this, too. PURCHASE MADE: June 8th REACHED PSA: June 16th GRADED & FINALIZED: June 20th Drop any questions I’ll try to answer them here. Likely not selling this card btw, I’m sure there’s better priced PSA 9s than what I’d part with it for after this emotional ordeal.",

          "text": "EDIT: Was asked by some people to ID the seller so they can block. Tag is: **cabaseball41** Some of you may have seen an initial post about this situation, but it finally came to a conclusion today so I wanted to post about it. I both buy and sell on Ebay, so I know mistakes happen sometimes. This situation is pretty wild though. On Sunday, May 11th 2025, I bought a sports card from a seller. The card in question was a Bowman Draft 2021 - Andrew Painter - Genesis - GNS-12 1/1 Superfractor. PSA Slab is 88537810. Given the hype around this prospect, I expected the auction to skyrocket -- clearly the seller did too, as he had initially listed it a few times over the past year for $1,500. Well, at the end of this auction I came out as the winner...for $206. I was ecstatic & paid immediately. This didn't last though, as a few hours later I get a message from the seller: \"I am so sorry about this, went to print a label and ship your item and realized this was already sent to COMC 2 weeks ago by my partner after cross referencing the lists. I can offer you this same card on COMC for the same price as soon as it gets listed if thats ok?\". For those who aren't aware, COMC is a trading card marketplace & consignment shop. Some sellers will send cards to COMC to have the sales managed by them. Its totally legit (I've bought COMC cards on Ebay before) but the cancellation was odd. See, he immediately cancelled the order (I didn't tell him to), and he chose 'Buyer Requested to Cancel' as the reason. When I noticed this a few days later, I reached out again & he said 'Honest mistake, that's my bad. I'll have it fixed'. I got on a call with support too, and they gave me the following advice: give it a few weeks to see if he truly honors the deal, and if not then leave negative feedback. I thought feedback wasn't an option because he said that I had chosen to cancel, but apparently since I paid right away it opened up the feedback form? Idk, I decided I'd wait it out. Fast forward ",

Eine kurze Zusammenfassung zu jeder Karte: \\- Clefairy Dream League (Raw aus Ebay vor 4 Jahren für 100€ gekauft), habe auf ne 10 gehofft \\- Gengar & Mimikyu - Cracked aus einem AOG 10, hatte einen kleinen weißen Dot auf der hinteren unteren linken Kante, Centering hat mich nur etwas überrascht \\- Urgl aus der Stamp Box, allgemein schwerer zu graden also war zu erwarten \\- Charizard Shiny Treasure - gezogen, Grade hat mich überrascht weil es mir auch mal runtergefallen ist. Vermutlich deswegen am Black lable vorbei... \\- Jolteon Terastial Festival, auch gezogen, hab mit ner 10 gerechnet \\- Gemini Elf, gekauft in Japan für 5000 Yen, war nicht perfekt also faires grade \\- Pikachu Stamp Box - war clean, hab ich erwartet \\- Celebi Gold Star, gekauft als GRAAD 7 (altes Slab) (250€) auf Cardmarket, cooles Upgrade \\- Mew Gold Star, gekauft in Japan (Osaka - BEE) für 50.000 Yen (300 €), happy über das grade \\- Mewtwo Gold Star, gekauft in Japan (Kyoto - Book Off) für 8.000 Yen (50 €), happy \\- Mc Donalds Pikachu und Slowpoke - gekauft in Japan (Kobe) als Bundle von ner Privatperson - 20.000 Yen \\- Primal Kyogre - Gekauft in Japan für 5460 (Yokohama, war ein kleiner Shop) Yen (33€) - happy und stolzer besitzer der schlechtesten Primal Kyogre in BGS :D \\- Blaine's Charizard, gecracked aus einem PGS Slab (war eine 8) \\- Gyarados Top Sun, keine Ahnung warum das nicht gegraded wurde, bin ich gerade im Austausch mit dem Support (hat eine Pop 1, sollte eigentlich gegraded werden) Die Slabs von PGS und AOG habe ich zum Review eingeschickt, vermutlich breche ich die jetzt auf und schicke sie noch einmal ein. Meiner Meinung nach sollte man nicht für ein Review bezahlen, zumindest das Alakazam und das Pikachu hat meiner Meinung nach ein ",

Money is absolutely a factor and picking and choosing my battles is crucial. It is so interesting how the journey unfolds. When I committed to exclusively obtaining these, I had no idea on pricing, just my intuition and research. What determined a cards price? Is grading really a factor, umm not so much, as sgc, beckett, old gai, and psa \" authentic trading card\" do not have numerical grades. Eye appeal is the determining factor? What about the card itself, under normal circumstances the card is everything, but if theres only 3 - 4 - 5 examples out there its slim pickens. Same with the autograph itself, what did they use to sign? Im not a sharpie fan, the instrument they signed with also adds to the vaIue. ☆ Time in the market. I bought some of these 20 years ago, the prices were very reasonable, I didnt know anything about the nuances of these cards other than I liked the actual signature. Pipgras, Gehringer, Riggs Stephenson, and Babe Ruth to name a few have wonderful autographs. I watched a few ebay auctions and the prices were strong, stronger than I was willing to pay, same with some large auction house offerings. I researched sold lots going back 10 years or so, noticed some HOFers were pretty consistent and others where a huge jump had taken place. The uncle jimmy prices were very strong, but relative bargains on certain rareities the average bidder wouldn't know. Anyhow, I let a few cards get past me that I regret not securing, who knows when that opportunity will come back. Ive been focusing on volume to build the collection, and when that slows down, Ill be picking off the tough ones and it'll be a pleasant surprise as they reveal themselves to the market. These cards are a different animal. Thx for reading.",

So I am very close to sending in a good amount of cards, which obviously means I’m about to spend hundreds if not maybe $1000+, and I am torn between who to go with. TAG- I feel like I have seen more negative comments about TAG than positive, but feel like I have a better chance of getting 10’s with them than the rest. PSA- PSA is well, PSA. Still somehow gold standard but super inconsistent and takes forever to get cards graded, none the less returned. CGC- I have had the best experience with them, with a higher ratio of 10’s, including one pristine amongst the 12-15 cards I have sent in to them. I feel most comfortable with them but know that if I ever wanted to resell, their 10 is worth the least I believe. Beckett- I have never submitted with them, but have heard that although they are stricter, if not the strictest, a 10 with them speaks higher than the rest, so most risk for most reward. Missing any other companies, or any other major points that should be considered, please feel free to let me know, as this is a lot of money for me, with potentially a lot of return. And it is very helpful in just general education on grading and the different options that are out there. FINALLY, I do not want the comments to turn into people rooting for one company and badmouthing another, or Tax towards another person because they favor a different company than your I am simply looking for each individuals, personal experience and or any facts that can be provided. This is a community, and a community is helpful, kind, and generous to each other. Not jealous, mean, or hateful. Thank you",

I’ve read and read reviews, opinions, and thoughts on grading, but I figured I’d ask the community. With PSA being the long time go to, it’s almost offensive when you ask a hobby veteran (that has always used PSA) about another grading service. Obviously Beckett has been around for awhile, and the excuse I’ve gotten for them not being good is their slabs are different size than PSA. What is the issue with Beckett? Then you got SGC, which I think their slabs look great with the black border. Then there is TAG. Personally, I think these look phenomenal. With TAG using Ai, which I would think creates more accuracy in the industry, why wouldn’t people support this? Is the real reason people stand by PSA, because they’ve been around the longest, and if the hobby supports someone like TAG who uses more accurate measures for grading, it would make the past 30 years of PSA graded cards essentially worthless. (Not worthless, just adding that for dramatic effect). Either way, the purpose of this is for me, and hopefully other to gain knowledge and read through peoples personal opinions and experiences. Thanks in advance and happy hunting!",

So I figured this one was fake... until I tried to find anything and came across a PSA authenticated version not numbered (slide 4) I read the description (slide 5) of that goldin sale, and it says something about some sort of redemption for a signed Jordan record breakers card. And some of those have UD stickers on the back . Mine does not have a sticker on the back, but it also mentions these could’ve been signed at a basketball camp or another sort of event. So maybe that’s why there’s no sticker. (IDK) I personally think the autograph looks pretty good. But Reddit I need some help in finding any info on this card and just opinions on it in general. I’m likely gonna send it in and hope for the best.",

All of you talk about pop control and Quality checks this that and the other, let me be the first to tell you that PSA is the biggest culprit of everything under the sun, their motto should be “value is in the eye of the beholder” because whoever handled my cards was either having a bad day or just doesn’t care, they have no standard of grading cards, their grading level system on the website is a lying POS, plus “if the grader believes”... BS my card is what it is, if the graders mad he/she doesnt have said card I can get a Lower grade and never know why, I’ve never had luck with PSA, perfectly centered non damaged cards come back 7-8s... before I continue on that rant.. I decided to go the Beckett route as everyone else imo has ugly slabs and I’m a fan of knowing what my sub grades are... I’ve seen all this fuss and mixed reviews on Beckett within the recent year and it has me nervous as I chose 20-25 day turnaround time and some people are reporting lost cards, 3-4 month time delays on a non 45+ day order, just curious if anyone is in the bad/good area with Beckett !

After looking through the pricing chart for PSA, it looks like he could be paying thousands of dollars just to grade them. I could afford to grade them all, and would have the time to sell them all individually. I was wondering if anyone has any personal experience in doing something like this. I have a feeling I already know the answer, that this is a task not worth getting involved in, but I might be wrong so I thought I’d ask here first.",

My account is in time-out now bcause f\\*ck eBay and their Buyer Protection for people that can't read a complete item description. Anyway, this has to do with me being a buyer. Was helping a family friend (senior citizen) with their older digital camera. Researched and the camera only took up to a 512MB card. I didn't have any cards that old but I found an eBay seller that did. Bought the card, and when it was it was delivered (I wasn't home but my wife was) USPS knocked on our door and had her write a check for the balance on shipping. So I get home, and I message the seller. He tells me he used eBay shipping (yes) and I confirmed the label on the box. Asked him why I had to cover part of the shipping when I thought it was all paid up front, and he had no clue. Took the box, contents and all, to my local USPS and as soon as I got to the counter the clerk says Clerk: eBay? Me: Yeah, eBay. I got charged extra and I... Clerk: That's our box. We recognize those anywhere. Me: Looks at box, and the seller had cut a USPS box open and turned it inside-out and taped it together. \"Ok, I see that.\" Clerk: That's a flat rate box. eBay postage didn't cover the whole rate, so you had to pay the balance. So I opened a case with eBay to recover the extra postage because it's not cool to surprise a customer with an extra charge. USPS had written a note on the box label about extra postage being needed, so I uploaded a pic to eBay but also made it very clear I just wanted a partial refund to cover the extra postage. Seller got the notice and messaged me asking me to close the case and said they weren't in the wrong. I message him back explaining that I shouldn't have to bear the cost of surprise postage, and that he should be upfront and honest with shipping and also shouldn't try to take advantage of \"free\" USPS boxes. He didn't agree of course. After some back and forth with eBay and making it very clear I wa",

          "text": "My little story About 9 years ago I got the sudden urge to relive my childhood and hopped on eBay to see what I could find. I wanted to buy an older pack to get that pure dopamine rush of being a kid, ripping open a pack and the beginnings of my gambling addiction (if you know you know) I found 2 Japanese booster packs for $17.52 a piece (now worth around $600 a piece) I said screw it and ordered 2. When they came in, I just sat there for almost a week looking at them thinking what could be in those packs. Do I chance it and open them??? Or do I keep them sealed like an asshole?? No chance. I was sitting on my couch and had my dog (Cowboy) next to me god rest his soul and when I opened the first pack and got the wiff of that 1996 air I instantly knew this was the right move. I sifted through that first pack and when I hit the rare card I saw this and immediately jumped off my couch making caveman noises as loud as humanly possible. My dog started losing his shit in the process (he was happy too 😂) it was literally like hitting a lottery ticket. This was the one we all wanted and I never got to actually find as a kid. From that point on I’ve kept the passion alive and continued to collect. So in a way this card was what got me back into the hobby. I always told myself for years I was going to get it graded so I can keep it preserved forever. A couple months ago I finally had the chance to do that when I saw GameStop was doing PSA submissions and got it back a few days ago. I couldn’t be more happy and this is one I will have forever.",

          "text": "How I pre-grade my cards before submitting. A guideline to getting 9s and 10s more frequently. So there was a request to go into more detail about pre-grading so I thought I would follow up with what I personally do. Im sure there are plenty of other ways people do it. This is my method. First thing is I will create 2 piles of cards that are contenders. I do a brief scan, look for obvious whitening and off centering. 1 pile is cards I think are strong 10s, while the other pile is 9's + I start with centering first and foremost. Its the most obvious to see so I will scan the cards, and the front of the card is more strict than the back, so I look for pretty much 45/55 centering on cards, and if you arent sure, take some time to look through PSA 10 sold listings on ebay. PSA does make occasional mistakes but it will give you an idea for what good centering looks like. The second thing I will do is look at the back, centering on the back is more lenient but the main thing im looking for is whitening. You can still get a PSA 10 with 2 whitening spots if they arent too bad, 1 is still a 10, and none is even better. Than the next thing I look for on both sides of the cards is any dents, dings, any type of damage what so ever. It will automatically drop your card to a 5-7 even if its a tiny ding you can barely notice. It has a HUGE impact on the grade. The next thing I look at is edges, sometimes the cards have bad edges and its hard to tell but when you compare it to other cards you start to notice that some are clearly worse than others. Its hard to tell sometimes since its so thin, but sometimes it seems like entire cards have these micro dents along the edges and it destroys the gradability and is pretty hard to notice. The last thing I look for and I look real close at multiple angles is any surface issues and scratches on the card. Print lines still happen, scratches still happen. Lately ive noticed random scratches on the backs of the cards more than usual. I suspec",

          "text": "A brief outline of grading pokemon cards. When,what, and why to grade. I see a lot of questions being asked about card grading and a lot of bad information and misconceptions. I will spare you guys a whole book and keep it as concise as possible. In the hobby no matter what shop you go to, what card show, what message board you stumble upon, or which youtuber you watch, it seems like having graded cards is essential to participating in the hobby. While grading is quite popular in pokemon due to the hobby being 90% collectors and investors, in other card games that are built more of players, grading is virtually non existent with the exception of a few cases like vintage magic and numbered cards. Pokemon is completely fueled by hype, and has always been since the day the cards came out. We all had Beckett collector and pojo magazines to research the prices of our cards, and since day one its been a very collectible and value driven card game. Grading got popular during the logan paul boom from the poketubers of the time showing how it was a very profitable money making method and it was as simple as buying a raw card from a shop, grading it, and making profit. Obviously as the popularity grew with logan paul and the insane values of the cards like the 20k bulbasaur(/s) everyone decided to start grading cards, which led to the infamous 1 year + bulk turnaround time on PSA. In this day and age in the hobby grading is so well known and so essential that PSA 9's in a very large amount of cases are worth about the same as the raw cards. The price disparity shrunk rapidly as more and more people starting grading for profit to the point where it is right now which is either psa 10 or bust. Now the main reason to grade a card is to 1, authenticate, and 2 maximize the price discovery. Authenticating real cards is important for obvious reasons. Take a 1/1 card like the one ring in magic for example, even if its grades a psa 5, its important to know its authentic and its offici",

Fast forward 30 years I can say I have that card, not only do I finally own the card I always wanted, I think I have the only collection in the world like this. Complete PSA 1-10, I’m going to get the 10 re-slabbed with the current label for sake of the look in the frame. One interesting thing about this collection is the PSA 2 is the only one in the world with qualifying marks (MK) on the grade. Thanks to all the sellers from EBay in helping me complete.

From some other reddit posts it seems like these are super hard to sell cuz a lot of sellers reseal them and a lot of buyers would just claim theyre resealed? Should I open them and PSA grade the cards in them? Or do I have to just go to a convention and try to sell them IRL? Are there any good online options?",

I am a long-time collector of this hobby that recently came back after taking a break when the Sun and Moon era ended, and I despise this hobby. First, I can't even get new product because people keep buying it out and it is so frustrating, because I do NOT want to support scalpers on eBay. I hate prismatic evolutions with every fiber of my being, and I think that this is one of the most overhyped and \"FOMO\" sets in the history of this hobby. I can't go to one card show without these new-gen modern only vendors that started last month shoving eeveelution cards down my throat. No, I DO NOT want to buy your color dog for 2 grand, and I'm sorry I won't sell my cards at 40% because you've \"never heard of a rainbow rare\" and \"it's not expensive enough.\" I want to make up for lost time so badly, but I cannot fathom how people justify that a CARD THAT IS STILL IN PRINT (umbreon ex psa 10) is more expensive than a decently conditioned 1ST EDITION BASE SET CHARIZARD (which is obtainable with some wear on the card). Next, the Pokémon community's social setting has deteriorated as a whole, especially the people that represent this community. A lot of the Youtubers that have been with this community for years have bought into the hype and have turned out to be pieces of shit. Leonhart especially pisses me off, and that \"trade up\" video he posted really rubbed me the wrong way. Whatnot has also gotten much worse (although in my opinion the platform wasn't the greatest) with these giant streamers inflating the prices of singles even more, with their massive toxic fanbases buying into their mindless ramble. I know the Pokémon Company isn't at fault entirely for the scalping of the modern sets, but I wish that they prepared a little bit better for it. A longer waiting period between sets would be welcomed with open arms if they had more time to stock up o",

I’m planning to visit a card show in June and I saw that the card show has what they call « on site grading » which I assume will be PSA and Beckett since they seems to be sponsoring the event. So here’s my question, how does this work? For PSA exemple, can I have economy service or it’s just premium that they offer on site? Can I just bring my card leave it to them and they send it back according to the service that I paid for? Something more specific for Canadians, since the card show is in Canada, I assume that this could be a really good way to go to save on shipping and custom paperwork? Thank’s!",

But I’ve never done any sort of submission to PSA, so here are my questions. Basically, trying to figure out what to pay for cards that are on the borderline of a 9 and a 10 and the PSA fees are much different. One card in particular, the value of a 10 is around $3000. Drops to a 9 and we’re looking at $500. What happens if it’s determined to be a 9 and I paid the fees that valued the card at a 10? Will I get a refund for the difference? And what if I were to go the self assessment route of a 9 grade and it’s determined to be a 10 PSA? I’d be asked to pay the difference (?) which I’d absolutely be willing to do. Is it better to pay more and be safe? Also, there are a bunch of cards that I’d like to get graded, I understand you need to do one submission per card but can all the cards be shipped in a box to PSA? Finally, shipping. Do you take insurance out on the shipping or no?",

I only dabble every now and then in the hobby but I bought a box of Topps Chrome in June 1997 and pulled that card and some other nice ones like a Jordan and Ray Allen RC I don't know the ins and outs of grading but I think the Kobe would grade out to about an 8. No greening, sharp corners, but a little off-center top to bottom. I say \"would\" because I got a call from Fedex today and they said PSA refused delivery because the box had been tampered with. A flap was said to have been opened and retaped. So someone probably swiped the card. I'll find out for sure soon enough as the box is being returned to me.",

          "text": "PSA GRADING QUESTION (MIS PRINT LABEL) So i bought this card off ebay a couple months back from a reputable seller(sells higher end cards and has sold other sticker auto cards before) and i sent it in to psa to grade but it came back with a PSA Factory Mis-Print Label Do Not Holder Label on the Card Saver i sent it in. The Question i have is why didn't psa grade it is it because its a regular silver prizm with a sticker auto added on and a beckett authenticated sticker on the back? Also Would any other companies grade it such as BGS/SGC? I'm thinking about sending it to BGS and see if they will grade it but wanted to know if anyone has had this happen to them or had any recommendations! *Pics of Silver Prizm Sticker Auto Herbert Card Below - https://gyazo.com/27302c55ec0032c757daf2bbd5332764 *Beckett Authentication - https://gyazo.com/a267419dfe3499a2e8f112e1bd87b2ba",

I bought these thinking that it would be a simple mystery graded slab from top grading companies that they mention in their description and the main website of this “company”. They mention PSA Beckett TAG “CGC” but what they don’t tell you is that “CGC” stands for “Cosmic Grading Company” which translates into them putting BULK value cards in a graded slab and grading the cards themselves. I sadly bought 6 total cards from these guys so I urge you to STAY AWAY! They are difficult to work with and when I caught on that the grade the card themselves, they would not accept any sort or refund or return. SO AGAIN THIS IS A TOTAL SCAM, LET ME BE THE LESSON.",

That said, I figured it would be a great opportunity to try to pickup up some Drake Maye cards at a “discount” from a crazy high prices from the past couple of months. So I started monitoring sales of his Prizm silver cards PSA 9 on eBay and I noticed a significant discrepancy in prices. All the cards in the screenshots are from sales today. Does anyone know why sales range as low has $189 to high as $292 despite all ending on the same day and all were auctions. Any clue? Are people trying to find the “best” cards and crack the for regrade? Thanks in advance for all replies.",

I’ve done away with categorizing cards by set number as that only invited confusion and trolls, so the above represents the totality of Fusion World, including all booster boxes, Energy Markers and both Manga Booster Sets. Set and card number are indicated, as well as grade received (and from which grading company). Under the cards you’ll find the price the card was sold at, which does not include tax or shipping, as well as the sales date. All sales are from eBay. I also note whether the sale was sold at auction, at the listed price, or if a best offer was accepted. In the interest of keeping variety, I’ve included no duplicate cards in the list, (otherwise the list would just be a bunch of FP-001 sold listings ranked by sale price, which might be an separate and interesting future assignment). The only exceptions to this are FB01-139 and FB06-120, which both appear once as a BGS 10 Black Label and then once as a non-black label PSA/BGS 10. I found this to be a good illustration of the difference between a black label and a regular 10 for the same graded card. As always this is for informational purposes only. If it’s not useful or interesting to you, feel free to move on. **I’ve decided I may just start blocking folks who want to constantly rehash the “people like you are ruining the hobby” argument, when all I’m doing is reporting objective price data. That way they won’t ever see my hard work again which they claim is useless information to them in the first place**. But to the rest of you, enjoy, and happy to discuss anything shown here.",

The employee told me there still weren’t any — but then he mentioned the store is apparently closing in about a week and everything is getting transferred to another location. That honestly sounded like a worst-case scenario with my cards already stuck in limbo. So I basically pleaded with him and said I’d just eat the \\~$220 submission cost if he could give me my cards back. I think he realized how messy/unreasonable the situation was because he actually gave me my cards back on the spot — but I didn’t get any refund. I’m relieved to have the cards back, but I’m still out the money. Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Any advice on how I should try to pursue a refund (corporate, district manage, etc.), or am I probably out of luck. I paid in cash so I can’t charge back.",

I had no idea this rarity even existed and was initially disappointed it wasn’t the normal manga rare until I saw the price. How should I proceed from here? The back is 55:45 but everything else is as mint as it gets. I’d like to sell the card to try and get as much as possible. I’m based in Ireland which makes submitting for grading a bit more difficult than usual, and I’m hesitant to have this card be in the postal system. Is there much of a price difference between PSA and Beckett for One Piece? I think it would probably cost over €500 for me to grade it with PSA, whereas I can pay the more expensive Beckett tier for sub €200. I am considering grading and then selling through somewhere like Fanatics. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated!",

Beckett Pros: Higher standards equals higher value on slabs that get a pristine 10; cheaper grading fees; quicker TAT; sub-grades allow for transparency; slabs look better (that's just my opinion). Beckett Cons: the dreaded 9.5 score is very common, and while many 9.5's can cross-grade to PSA 10's, the value isn't the same as a PSA 10.",

For context — I’ve been submitting cards for grading for a while and I’m pretty strict about what I send in. My pre-grading standards are tough, and so far I’ve had about a 92% PSA 10 rate out of 103 total cards I’ve submitted. I know that’s not a massive number for some, but I’d say I’m fairly confident in my eye for grading. Recently, I sent in the card as shown in the pictures. The grader notes mentioned a dent along the right side (no specification if it was on the front or back). After checking it myself, showing it to a few friends and vendors who grade regularly, and even having Beckett take a look — everyone agreed there’s no dent at all. I even checked it under a blacklight and found nothing. I’ve helped friends crack and resend cards before, but I’ve never personally done a review submission — where you send in the slab as-is for PSA to reassess it. So... what would you do? Crack and resend, or send for review? Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with similar situations.",

I recently bought a grey felt hat Pikachu on EBay that was completely sealed. It’s a gift to my wife, no grading plays, but I received it from PSA authentication today opened. Not only opened, but the official Van Gogh card isn’t with it either, which we wanted to display with it. Since they can grade the sealed ones in wrappers, it feels kinda weird that they opened the sealed promo on my behalf without asking or mentioning it. Anyone else had this happen?",

But I haven’t seen anything recent since PSA is being investigated by the FBI and Beckett’s CEO getting in trouble for something in November of 2024. PSA seems to be wishy washy depending on the graders mood. CGC sounds ridiculously strict. And BGS sounds great if your card is PERFECT. So I basically have it boiled down to going with BGS or PSA. But my worry is their authenticity in grading. I don’t want to send a sure thing to PSA and get a 9 cuz the grader hasn’t gotten laid in months. But I don’t want to send to BGS if they’re gonna screw me over either. Idk I guess I just need help? I really wanna do research before sending my first cards in.",

So, right off the bat, we've got Drake May verse Jaden Daniels. And look at how they have separated themselves. That's Drake May, the light blue line. Wow.

Now, that has been a real investment over the course of the last 5 years. Look at those ones and how they've gone up. Particularly John Elway. [music] Gosh, his stuff has been so hot recently. Great to see these old guys still getting the love. Oh man, two guys not getting the love at all. Zion Williamson and Jaw Morant. Look at the complete collapse of their rookie cards. Both of these guys were so hyped when they came into the NBA in 2019. People were buying their cards like crazy. These are their Prism base cards. They almost hit $900, but look at where they are today. They're around $20 in a PSA 10. It has been an unbelievable fall from grace for both of these [music] guys. Oh, this graph, this is hard to look at. My goodness. Now, this one's interesting. Wendy, is he going to go the route of Zion and Jaw or is he going to rally b",

In this episode of Passion to Profession, sponsored by eBay, I sit down with Dave Amerman, Head of Revenue at Goldin. We cover: The Logan Paul Illustrator sale and what this moment means for the hobby How Goldin scaled from $25M a year to nearly $500M What changed inside the hobby after the pandemic boom Why understanding how to sell is the key to learning how to buy The risk Dave took leaving a stable finance career to start over Dave shares stories from: Buying collections in college for cash Starting his own auction house in his early 20s Turning a few hundred thousand dollar auction business into an $8M operation Joining Goldin before the Netflix spotlight and helping fuel its growth We also talk about sustainability in this market. The 86 Fleer Jordan PSA 10 ride. The flood of supply after peak hype. The difference between pop 2 and pop 300. If you collect. If you flip. If you dream about working in the hobby.

In this episode of Collector Nation , host Ryan Alford is joined by hobby veteran and Ludex CEO Brian Ludden for a wide-ranging conversation on the real economics behind today’s card market . They unpack how Super Bowl performances impact pricing, why PSA grading fees keep climbing, and why vintage cards continue to quietly outperform modern hype . 🧠 What You’ll Learn: Why grading modern cards is riskier than most collectors admit How PSA pricing and turnaround times affect card velocity The growing dominance of raw card transactions Why vintage cards behave more like “blue-chip assets” How branding and auction exposure multiply card values What most collectors misunderstand about supply & demand This episode is less about hype — and more about understanding how money actually moves in the hobby . 🤝 Connect with Collector Nation Ryan Alford Website: https://ryanisright.com Instagram / X: @ryanalford Brian Ludden – Ludex Website: https://www.ludex.com Download the Ludex App (iOS) Instagram / X: @ludexapp 🌐 Collector Nation: https://thecollectornation.com",

          "text": "Card Care, Grading, and the Line Between Preservation and Alteration | Kurts Card Care As the hobby grows more sophisticated, conversations around card care have become louder — and more misunderstood. In this episode of Collector Nation , Ryan Alford welcomes Kurt Colon of Kurt’s Card Care for a grounded discussion on what card care actually is, why it exists, and how collectors should think about preservation versus alteration. Kurt shares his personal journey as a lifelong collector, detailing how his background in craftsmanship and restoration led to building products — and education — for collectors worldwide. The conversation moves beyond surface-level debates and into deeper territory: why condition sensitivity increased, why modern materials behave differently, and why education matters more than chasing grades . Kurt also explains why he views cards as personal treasures first, investments second — a perspective shaped by decades of collecting and hands-on experimentation. Key Takeaways: Card care is about preservation, not manipulation Modern cards degrade differently than vintage paper Knowing what can’t be fixed matters as much as what can Education protects collectors more than any product The hobby’s future depends on informed stewardship This episode offers clarity, context, and a calmer perspective on a topic that often sparks unnecessary controversy.

Gordy explains what separates true investment-grade vintage cards from modern products, why scarcity and historical significance matter more than hype, and how high-end vintage continues to attract long-term collectors and sophisticated investors. The conversation covers iconic players like Mickey Mantle, Jackie Robinson, Roberto Clemente, and Ken Griffey Jr., and why their cards still anchor value in today’s market. Ryan and Gordy also dive into grading realities, population reports, PSA 8s vs. 9s, and why gem mint vintage cards rarely change hands. They discuss speculation, gambling-driven behavior in the hobby, the rise of live selling as media, and what newer collectors should understand before entering the vintage market. Whether you’re actively buying vintage, transitioning from modern, or just trying to understand where the hobby is headed, this episode delivers clear, practical insight without the noise. Topics Covered • Why vintage sports cards are gaining investor attention • What drives long-term value in vintage cards • PSA grades, scarcity, and population reports • Vintage vs modern card market dynamics • Entry points for collectors new to vintage • Gambling, speculation, and market psychology • Live selling and content-driven commerce • The future of high-end sports cards About the Guest Gordy Bonkers is a well-known voice in the sports card hobby, focusing on vintage education, market structure, and long-term collecting discipline. He hosts The Gordy Bonker Show on Sports Cards Nonsense and publishes a popular Substack newsletter covering the hobby.",

After completing this purchase, I discovered another active eBay listing — item #[Removed by Moderator] — showing the exact same PSA certification number (#[Removed by Moderator]) , identical card, and identical PSA slab. Since PSA certification numbers are unique, two listings showing the same number suggest one of the following: One or both listings are using stolen photos or counterfeit items, or The seller may be attempting to sell the same card to multiple buyers. Additionally, after my purchase, the seller ([Removed by Moderator]) issued me a partial refund of $9,038.38 but opted to not refund the $1,000.00 portion of the sale that was donated to charity . This appears to be an attempt to avoid refunding the full transaction amount, despite the authenticity and legitimacy of the item being in question. I've asked the seller to refund the remaining amount and will update if/when they respond. I contacted eBay's customer service and they said that, as of right now, they are unable or unwilling to refund me the $1000 charity donation portion of the purchase. Details: Purchased item: #[Removed by Moderator] Duplicate listing: #[Removed by Moderator] PSA Certification Number: [Removed by Moderator] Order number: [Removed by Moderator] Amount paid: $10,038.38 Partial refund received: $9,038.38 Amount withheld (charity donation): $1,000.00 My purchase date: November 9, 2025 • • Seller username(s): [Removed by Moderator]",

They're in great condition, in books, sleeves, breaks, etc. In just going through some, for example, I have a many good Jordan, Montana, various decent rookie cards, etc. I've looked into getting some of these graded and it seems as though psa is the \"top\" or at least most used service out there. Have any of you used this and how does it work? Do I send my cards to PSA and they grade them and hold them until sold? Is this secure? Does anyone have experience with this? Really curious as in looking at pricing, the grading process can get pretty pricey pretty quick. The payoff can be great, but out of pocket up front can go from $50 to $350 once it gets to them if I have a good card. For the Mods, I have googled and checked on eBay a few times; cannot seem to get a detailed idea of what EXACTLY the process is (definitely may be me). Feel free to remove if you can point me in the right direction with a link or info. **Yes, I have an active eBay store as well as some other channels for eCommerce. :) Thanks!!",

          "text": "my subreddits Newish to the hobby and just started submitting cards (sports cards) for grading. I’ve read and read reviews, opinions, and thoughts on grading, but I figured I’d ask the community. With PSA being the long time go to, it’s almost offensive when you ask a hobby veteran (that has always used PSA) about another grading service. Obviously Beckett has been around for awhile, and the excuse I’ve gotten for them not being good is their slabs are different size than PSA. What is the issue with Beckett? Then you got SGC, which I think their slabs look great with the black border. Then there is TAG. Personally, I think these look phenomenal. With TAG using Ai, which I would think creates more accuracy in the industry, why wouldn’t people support this? Is the real reason people stand by PSA, because they’ve been around the longest, and if the hobby supports someone like TAG who uses more accurate measures for grading, it would make the past 30 years of PSA graded cards essentially worthless. (Not worthless, just adding that for dramatic effect). Either way, the purpose of this is for me, and hopefully other to gain knowledge and read through peoples personal opinions and experiences. Thanks in advance and happy hunting!",

So, I bought a 1K+ grail card from PSA on eBay. The listing said \"USPS GA\" under the shipping (See attached). [](https://preview.redd.it/psa-on-ebay-and-shipping-v0-fmkjp11zmnkg1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a3dc6136e9e2b60da443ddaad38174693595f6d) This was next to the card as \"Shipping\" [The shipping service on the sale](https://preview.redd.it/copma0crpnkg1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0af430ba71b9e475590dcb1d98f95ef21b0640a) So, after 4 days, the order updates and a tracking # is provided... for FedEx. The thing is, I have a PO Box and USPS shipping was a must, given FedEx doesn't deliver to PO Boxes. FedEx, in my area has a really bad rep, and I'll leave it at that. I've messaged PSA through eBay (going on 3 days ago) and received no response. I called the PSA (the grading line) and they don't know anything saying eBay is a different department. Furthermore, they don't know how to contact them 🤦♂️. My understanding is that USPS has stopped doing \"last mile deliveries\" for FedEx. So, I fear this is going to get to the PO then get turned right back around. has anyone encountered this? What happened? Thanks!",

(Credit: Getty Images) By Darren Rovell — December 15, 2025 Share Monday marked the 40th anniversary of Operation Flagship. What is Operation Flagship? Well, unless your a law-enforcement historian, a sports fan in the Washington area, or know the connection to Al Pacino's 1989 movie \"Sea of Love,\" Operation Flagship is probably lost to time. But it's worth remembering because on Dec. 15, 1985, the U.S. Marshals Service pulled off one of the most incredible criminal roundups of all time. With only a $22,000 budget, federal officials apprehended an astounding 144 criminals in a single sting operation. The concept was simple. In the 1980s, Washington's NFL team was one of the hottest tickets in America. The scheme: Send an invite to the last known address of wanted criminals, saying if they showed up at a party announcing a new TV station, they would get a free lunch and two free tickets to the Cincinnati-Washington game that day. The invite also included the chance to win tickets to Super Bowl XX the following month in New Orleans. When the respondents showed up, they were ushered into a single room decorated as an elaborate party for Flagship International Sports TV, complete with balloons and cheerleaders. The author holds a PSA-graded ticket to the Operation Flagship game.

I can imagine most of us deal with some unscrupulous buyers, but for the majority we have excellent customers. I can handle a lying buyer, but lying sellers are a special breed. I bought a rather expensive limited edition coin that popped out of its case in shipping and got scratched up on the face. Oh well, accidents happen and things get overlooked in packaging so I opened a return. This seller states that I am to take responsibility for the damage that occurred in shipment, that I had to open a USPS claim on it, and that he would deny any returns. This guy has no idea how eBay works. Ignored all that and opened a case. They then proceed to threaten me with only a 50% refund. They are not top rated and don't have free returns. Proceed to ignore and ship the item back several times better packed then they did. I then receive an email that the seller opened a case against me. They proceed to claim that the item was missing the outer protective wrap (fancy way of being deceptive about the packing material it was stuffed in the package with (they packaged it with the equivalent of very thin foam, no saving it)), and that I sent back only half of the case of the coin, a plain bold faced lie, and continued, directly to eBay, to claim that they would only refund me 50%. Quite funny actually, except that in the end I got my money back, they got the coin back AND the money. I wish I could get this type of service for actual events of deceit considering i've sold over 250 times the amount of items this person has. But no, I can't get it even in events of buyers literally leaving a paper trail of receipts in messages about damages they sustain to items themselves. Just my rant for today. Wish eBay had a better report scenario in this case for people like this, but at least I have my money back so the story ends well there. Also too bad al",

Buyer says he only received an envelope containing the remote. And sent me a picture of the envelope he received with seemingly my shipping label on it. Obviously I didn’t send him just the remote. I sent him a 9.5lb cardboard box that was 16inches long and that’s what I paid for when I bought the shipping label. Buyer said he received a letter from usps and sent me a screen shot of it. The letter says “we are writing to inform you that the item has been damaged in handling by USPS” then the letter goes on about filling missing mail claim and making an insurance claim. So does USPS repackage damaged contents and continue shipping item? So what should I do here?",

After doing 10+ failed printing due to blurry label, I've finally figured it out at least on Mac. When you download the label, you need to re-export it to PDF but with Quartz Filter of \"Black & White\". * Download the label at 8.5 x 11. * Open the label in Preview. * File > Export * Format is PDF. Select Quartz Filter > Black & White. * And save. This will generate a bigger file size, around \\~120kB instead of the \\~87kB original download PDF from Mercari. I never have this problem with eBay Standard Envelope. I don't know why Mercari is being crap here. They could just easily give us a higher resolution shipping label.",

I sell sports cards — from low-dollar cards to high-value collectibles. Everything properly sleeved, protected, shipped with tracking, and handled professionally. Yet I’ve had buyers send photos of “empty envelopes” and claim the card wasn’t inside — even when tracking shows Delivered. And despite doing everything correctly as a seller, you can still be forced to refund. That means: • The card is gone • The money is gone • Shipping cost is gone • Fees are gone • And your time is wasted There is effectively no real protection when a buyer claims the package was empty. A tracking number isn’t enough. Delivery confirmation isn’t enough. The seller carries all the risk.",

Every time I need to ship one from a USPS location in a bubble mailer the shipping comes out to like 8.50 which kills orders that are 20 bucks and up requiring tracking. Is there any way to pay less. I know over 20 tracking is not required but recommended. Should I just do an envelope and take the risk. Orders over 50 I don’t mind getting tracking but still 8.50 is tough. Any tips would be appreciated.",

          "text": "I sell sports cards and use eBay’s standard envelope. I’m now being threatened because of it. This might be the last straw for me. Like the title says, I sell sports cards on eBay. As of this morning, I’ve sold $13,488 in the last 90 days. Of that total, a pretty large number of cards are $20 or less, and they ship with eBay standard envelope. I charge my buyers $1.89 to which I pay $1.32. The additional 57¢ covers my material and time. If you believe eBay, their standard envelope takes 3-5 business days to arrive. It also claims to have tracking so you can follow your order. So that’s what a lot of buyers expect. Now let’s talk about reality. On average, my ESE deliveries are talking about 10 days for most people. Some end up taking up to three weeks. Some don’t ever arrive. “Tracking” is a complete joke. It’s not scanned by USPS at any point. They work with some third party, and the only times they \\*might\\* get scanned are via a sorting machine at specific hubs. As well as being a pretty big seller, I’m also a buyer somewhat regularly. I just looked, and of the last 10 cards I bought with ESE, only four of them showed as delivered. The other six, per eBay’s “tracking” would be considered long lost at this point. If I was a miserable human, I could very easily claim they never arrived, and force the seller to refund me. Even though the card is 100% in my possession. Now let’s talk about the threat. I received this email from eBay this morning. (Sorry for having to copy/paste, I can’t add a screenshot) . . . . . . . . . “Dear Seller, We wanted to remind you that your seller performance has consistently fallen below our minimum standards in the United States. As a result, there’s now a risk that the selling limits will be lowered on your account, and in some cases, you may be permanently restricted from selling on eBay. Here’s what you should do: Check your Seller Dashboard to see where you can improve your seller performance. Go to your dashboard You can also learn",

Well the breaker said they were out of top loaders that fit the thick RPAs? To make matters worse, they also didn't have the right penny sleeves and looked like they were trying to force it into the regular ones. I made it clear that I wanted it sleeved and was going to grade it - they assured me that someone would put in top loader later before shipping. Well it came in the mail sandwiched between two top loaders (not inside either) with tape holding them together. One corner was visibly damaged. I reached out to them and to their credit they asked how they could make it right - which is where my dilemma is. I've been chasing this card so not a fan of sending it back for refund but I also am not happy at its condition now. Appreciate any ideas on suggestions on how they could \"make things right\".",

Unfortunately, my reintroduction was through breakers on fanatics as I was unaware of how problematic breaking was (please don’t yell at me! I am now aware of how bad breaking is for the hobby and will not be breaking with card breakers going forward). Anyway, I got a decent hit off a case break. I got the card yesterday and it has damaged in the corner. I didn’t notice any damage on the live stream, nor did the streamer indicate that the cards in the case were damaged in any way. There was no damage to the shipping from what I could tell. The damage is to one corner of the card, and my guess would be that it was damaged while the breaker was loading the card based on how the corner looks. Anyway I messaged the shop that I purchased the spot in the case break through about the damage. They asked what they could do to make this right and I said send a comp card or refund my purchase entirely. They instead replied by saying they can send me an empty card package for the particular case and I can send it back to Topps. They said that they receive cards that are already dinged up, which I can understand. However, I don’t want to risk submitting a claim with topps for a damaged card because if they deny my claim I will be screwed, especially because I have 30 days from date of purchase to raise any issues with an order on fanatics live. Anyway, just looking for some advice from those that have dealt with receiving damaged cards from a break on fanatics live",

          "text": "Side Hustle – Passive Income via eBay Dropshipping I want to share a realistic breakdown of how I make money online through eBay dropshipping, specifically for those who need a side hustle This is not a “get rich quick” post, and it’s not recycled advice for experts, this is for beginners (which is where most people go wrong). What I do (in simple terms) eBay dropshipping means: • You list products on eBay • You do not hold inventory • When a customer buys, you purchase the item from Amazon and ship it directly to the buyer No warehouse. No bulk stock. No upfront inventory sitting on shelves. ⸻ Why this works • eBay already has 135M+ buyers searching daily • You don’t need ads, a website, or marketing skills • You leverage existing traffic, not create demand • Entry cost is low compared to most businesses This is why it’s one of the easiest online models to enter if done properly. ⸻ My results (context matters) • I currently operate 15 profitable eBay stores • Each store generates $1,000–$3,000/month • This is consistent income, not one-off wins • I also run an agency helping others do the same I’ll attach screenshots for transparency. ⸻ The part most people screw up (and get banned) Account warm-up. This is where 90% of beginners fail. I use a 4-day warm-up process: • 3 days before opening the store • 1 day after the store goes live Skipping this is why people get limited or suspended and then say “eBay dropshipping doesn’t work.” It does work — just not if you rush it like an idiot. ⸻ Costs & setup (real numbers) • eBay Store subscription: \\~$25/month • Listing limits: up to 250,000 items/month (varies per account) • No inventory costs upfront • No ad spend Limits increase over time as the account is handled properly. ⸻ Automation & scaling I use AI + automation software for: • Product research • Listing creation • Price monitoring • Order fulfillment • Stock checks I also use virtual credit cards to keep payments stable and accounts clean.

We sell Japanese / anime collectables I made a post just like this a year ago, here's a link to that post if you want to see the differences between 2024 and 2025. Also has some more context on what we do and what we sell: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our\\_2024\\_sales\\_statistics\\_as\\_fulltime\\_ebay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our_2024_sales_statistics_as_fulltime_ebay/) The quick rundown though is we (me and my girlfriend) are full-time online sellers who predominately sell Japanese collectables, of which we import directly from Japan. Mostly obscure, vintage, and rare bits rather than modern stuff you can find anywhere. Most of the time we have over 8000 active individual listings on eBay. Notable statistics: Net Sales: $190,465.79 Profit: $99,167.20 Transactions: 5367 Average ROI: 427.51% All of these number are a touch worse than 2024, but not by much. 2023, 2024, and 2025 all had very similar yearly totals which heavily implies we've reached the limit of what we can make with our current system / setup. This year was interesting, particularly due to tons of changes due to our current... administration. Tariffs were a problem for us, because being Japanese collectable sellers 99% of our inventory comes imported straight from Japan. You'd think it's just a 15% increase in buy costs, because that's what the tariffs are, but it's worse than that. Tons of shipping methods skyrocketed in prices, and many international shipping providers pulled out of shipping to the US entirely. UPS and FedEx both hit you with tons of additional fees alongside the 15% tariffs, often times as \"brokerage fees\". I could go into it but the short of it is... screw UPS specifically. So many issues this year. As well, a lot of panic in the early months of year caused a notable dip in our sales. February was the lowest month we had in years, a s",

I started collecting about 5 months ago and quickly fell in love with the hobby and ripping packs, learning the market, and sharing it with family has been an awesome experience. I’ve been an NFL fan my whole life (proud eagles fan 🦅) and i played cornerback for several years, so i am very passionate about sports especially football. Football cards are my main focus, but I also enjoy baseball, basketball, and soccer including the collegiate version of football and basketball. I’m finishing high school in a few months and would love to start building a small sports cards business or side hustle, i think it would be a great opportunity to learn how the industry works and gain experience and knowledge. I am very hard working, fast learning and a great negotiator and i think most importantly, i am passionate. Any help would mean a lot to me so feel free to contact me about anything. I’d also really appreciate advice on: • How you got started selling or trading • Best platforms for Canadians (eBay, Whatnot, shows, etc.) • Shipping/packing efficiently and safely • Any common beginner mistakes to avoid I’m not sitting on a huge collection or big money, i am just trying to learn, work hard, and do things the right way. Any insight or experiences you’re willing to share would mean a lot. I know its not going to be easy and i am ready for it. I have a good sized collection with big hits and good pulls and everything is scanned and organized. If anyone wants to check it out i will be more than happy to show you. Thanks for taking the time to read, i really appreciate this community and i am looking forward to giving you guys updates on how it is going:) Contact me if you guys have any questions and have a great day!",

I pack and drop off my orders at the same time everyday so everything is out within 24 hours. When I leave for the post office I mark the PWEs as shipped. The day after I marked this order as shipped, I receive a message from the customer asking if I shipped and what the tracking number was. I informed them that I shipped the order yesterday and that I sent it PWE. They tell me that their mailman is a thief and if it doesn't have tracking they won't get the order. I tell them if they don't get the order by the estimated delivery time, we'll figure something out(I'd make them wait a couple more days and then refund them\"). Today they messaged me with a refund request saying that they don't trust that they'll receive their order since it doesn't have tracking and that they want a refund. It's only been 4 days since the order was shipped and today is a holiday. Do y'all think I should just refund them and take the loss or tell them to wait until the estimated delivery day? I know this is a part of the online seller game and I'm not too distraught about the money cause I'm really only $7 into this card, but I'd like some other opinions on the situation EDIT: I should have said I'm a seller with ~5k sale and I've sent hundreds of orders this size, this way. People almost always get their order and this is the first time someone has overtly tried to scam me like this. I'm going to make them wait and then escalate to TCGplayer before I refund. For the people who are saying I should track everything that's over $20, this business would not be sustainable and no one would sell a large volume of cards on TCGplayer if this was enforced.

Whenever someone asks, “How do you ship a sports card valued over $20?” If it’s a card valued over $19.99 or in a slab (or even 1-3 cards in this range), this is how I ship them for maximum protection: 1. Put the card and a Dad Man's Dugout sticker in a team bag. 2. Secure the card between 2 pieces of cardboard for extra stability. 3. Wrap it all with a rubber band to hold everything in place. 4. Include my handwritten thank-you note: I thank the customer for their purchase, ask them to follow my eBay store, Whatnot account, and social media. I also provide 1 or 2 fun facts about the player and ask for their feedback. 5. Place it in a bubble mailer, then nest that inside another bubble mailer for double protection. 6. Add a \"Fragile: Handle with Care\" sticker on the outside. For cards valued under $20, I keep it simpler with a team bag, folded paper case, and painter's tape inside a thank-you card (check my other video for details!). I'll upload more videos soon!

Now, i’m looking for an Ohtani Auto but they are all over $2500 and no one is willing to sell outside the US. I’ve messaged many sellers without success. I understand the potential problems for the sellers in this case. My preffered shipping method would be DHL insured for full value as i don’t want to skip customs in, i just want the card to arrive safely. :) Card shows are not an option as they are very scarce in the EU and sportscards for US sports are even harder to get (mostly Pokemon and other gaming cards). And other auction sites like Goldin or Heritage just don’t offer a variety of cards like eBay and tend to only offer even more expensive cards. Does anybody have suggestion how to work the problem or how to communicate with a seller to make an exception? I also would like to add that i still would like to use eBay just for safety reasons.

Over the past 3 months, we quietly launched a private beta with support for 8 games — including Riftbound — and today, we’d love to invite folks from this amazing new TCG community to try it out and tell us what’s missing. **What we've built for Riftbound:** * 🆓 A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch) * 💸 Real-time price syncing with Cardmarket & TCGPlayer * 📊 Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early * 🗂️ Custom trade lists, deck-building lists, or whatever you collect * 🌍 Multi-TCG support: MTG, Pokémon, Lorcana, Flesh and Blood, Sorcery, One Piece, Rise TCG and now Riftbound (more coming soon) **This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on user feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 3 months ago and have started sharing our tool with the smaller TCG communities, but we feel that the time has come to share it with the Riftbound community before the big launch. **👉** We’re opening 200 early-access invites to the Riftbound community here: [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=riftboundtcg](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=riftboundtcg) **We're giving away 1 Origins Booster Box to one of the first 200 player who:** 1. Joins via the invite link 2. Adds some cards to their collection 3. Creates a list (trade / wishlist / decklist — your choice!) Our marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker will stay free forever. We're in this for the long haul - building the tools we wish existed to easily build decks, trade cards, and understand where your portfolio stands. We're still in beta, and we're really looking for some feedback/ideas to improve it, especially from the early Riftbound community. What features would make this invaluable fo",

Obviously I cannot send one-touches in the standard under 3oz first class shipping (too heavy/thick) and I don't want to pay $4-$5 to send out giveaways (I do 20-40 per show). I supposed I'll have to enable the first class shipping, and set the mag auctions at 4-7 oz... my concern is that me or my customers will be severely overcharged for shipping and I'll spend an hour every show submitting claims for reimbursement from Whatnot. Has anyone figured out how to do this? Thanks",

          "text": "Update on My Missing Mega Charizard X EX From Whatnot “Qualitypulls”– Not Satisfied Hey everyone — just wanted to give an update on my situation with the Mega Charizard X EX SAR 110/080 (Japanese Inferno X) that I pulled on Whatnot back on October 7. USPS tracking (92001903478427300484215881) still shows the package was never accepted, meaning the seller never shipped my card. I sent Whatnot all the proof — tracking, screenshots, video of the pull, and even other buyer reviews showing similar issues with this same seller. After weeks of waiting, I finally got this response from Whatnot (screenshot attached). They determined the “market value” of my missing card is $720, refunded what I paid ($48.23), and gave me $671.77 in Whatnot credit. Here’s the problem: • The actual raw value of my card is around $750–$900, not $720. • Graded, the same card sells for $2,000+ (PSA 10) and up to $12,000 (BGS 10 Black Label). • And worst of all, it looks like the seller still has his account active, even though there are multiple reports of him doing the same thing to others. I appreciate Whatnot for at least responding, but this outcome doesn’t sit right. The platform basically gave me partial value in credit while the seller gets to keep a potentially $2,000+ card. That’s not justice. Buyers — please be careful out here. Scammers are getting smarter, and even when you have all the proof, you might still end up shortchanged. Whatnot needs to do better protecting its buyers. We spend real money on this platform, and scammers like this ruin the trust for everyone.",

After years of playing Magic competitively and trading cards at events across the US, we kept running into the same problems. Tracking our collection values was a mess of spreadsheets. Organizing trades meant juggling TCGPlayer tabs and scattered notes. And we never really knew our portfolio's true performance over time. So we built CardNexus - a modern portfolio tracker designed specifically for serious TCG players and collectors who care about value. **What we've built for MTG:** * A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch) * Week-on-week portfolio tracking - see how your collection's value changes over time * Real-time price tracking synced with the two major marketplaces * Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early * Custom lists for trades and deck building * Support for all MTG formats and sets (plus 5 other TCGs if you're diversified, such as Sorcery, Flesh and Blood, One Piece, Lorcana, and Pokemon) **This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on user feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 7 weeks ago and have started sharing our tool with the smaller TCG communities but we feel that the time has come to share it with the MTG community. **Today, we're opening 200 beta spots specifically for the** r/mtgfinance **community.** **The hook:** We're giving away a $200 MTG booster box (your choice from TCGPlayer) to one lucky member who joins via our link, uploads their collection, and creates a trade list! Get your invite here: [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=mtgfinance](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=mtgfinance) Our marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker will stay free forever.

For months, I've had this nagging feeling that I was working my tail off for profits that just didn't seem to add up. I got fed up with the guesswork, so I ran an experiment. I took a batch of 50 mid-value hockey cards and decided to track *everything*. What I found was grim, but it provides some clarity on why so many of us feel like we're on a hamster wheel. **Part 1: The Time Sink is Real.** Just tracking the raw time to get 50 cards from a sorted box to \"sold and shipped\": * Photography: 2.1 hours * Research & Pricing: 2.5 hours * Listing Creation: 3.3 hours * Packaging & Shipping: 2.9 hours * **Total: Nearly 11 hours of actual work.** That's over 13 minutes of pure labor per card. By day three, I was so burned out on the operational grind I couldn't even look at another card. **Part 2: What I actually paid in fees was 17.6%** This is the part that should make you angry. I took one of my better sales—a **$35 card** where the buyer paid **$5 shipping**—and broke down every single cost: * Started with **$40 gross revenue**. * eBay's Final Value Fee: **-$5.67** (They charge 13.25% on the TOTAL including shipping and tax, which is how the number gets so inflated). * Per-Order Fixed Fee: -$0.30 * Promoted Listing Fee: -$1.07 (Basically mandatory to get seen). * Actual Shipping Cost: -$5.00 * Packaging Materials: -$0.75 After all that, I had **$27.21 left from my \"$35 sale.\"** The advertised 13.25% fee is total BS. My **True Effective Fee Rate** on the revenue I received was **17.6%**. Nearly one in five dollars vanished into a black box of fees. I'm laying this all out because I'm tired of guessing. I'm working on a better way to handle all this, but I wanted to share the raw numbers first. I'm curious if this matches what other high-volume sellers are seeing. How are you guys tracking this st",

I continuously get people in my chat which are legit vultures, asking to pay $35 for a Luis Angel HFA and a Mookie ultraviolet COMBINED like bruh what? Then get mad at me. I feel like people swoop into my streams because I have low viewers and try to take advantage of me. Anyways I get like 2 or 3 people in my stream, max I’ve had is like 15. I’m about to just switch to eBay but I like the app and the idea of it so I’m looking for a little advice. Thanks Update: I am definitely stepping away from the card game on whatnot. After thinking about it and reading y’all’s comments some of yall are 100% correct it is not a smart business move, unless you are big and have connections. I will just put up one card on eBay and sold it within 5 hours for above what I was trying to get. Thanks guys. Also f*** giveaways and shipping rookie mistake, I’ll stick to buying. Maybe I can be as predatory as all the people who hop in the lobby for a giveaway or ask 1/8 of the value of products.",

That raised an alarm as only one item was bought. Anyways item finally “arrives, except it didn’t. I live in a house, and tracking says delivered at front desk. I knew right then and there it was too good to be true. I contact eBay for a refund. They deny it. I appeal it, they deny it again saying seller provided proper documentation... Finally I call eBay and get a hold of an awesome lady who said she has seen this more and more and sellers price stuff under $750, because no signature or picture is required for drop off. I then had to sign a declaration stating I never got this and lying could result in perjury charges... but I finally got my money back. What a nightmare though.",

So previously I would go on places like eBay or Mercari to get these sports cards. Mind you, these are basic cards, but I was paying like $1-$2 per card depending on the set , player, condition. I feel like I’m over paying for these cards. I was doing the same thing with Pokémon cards ( paying $1/per card—lowest amount you can charge on Mercari ) for cards I later found out were worth .05 . I started learning the prices and would let the mercari sellers know and make them sell me it in bulk with the right pricing. But then I just started buying from TCG directly becus it was easier than having mto haggle with the ppl on Mercari and shipping was usually free after spending $5. I was wondering if there is a sports card site similar to this where they sell cards for diff prices depending on quality as well as way better prices that actually correlate with the market value and not just same made up amount like on eBay and Mercari.",

I’m trying to make selling on TCGPlayer a legitimate side hustle so I can make at least some money back on playing this game. My ultimate goal is to make Yugioh at least somewhat of a self sustaining hobby, which means selling bulk instead of just the shiny cards. I just have a few questions on how to actually make that transition. 1. Storage. That’s the biggest one, I need a more effective storage solution for my cards. What do you guys use as effective and concise storage that keeps large amounts of product safe and easy to access? 2. Shipping. What do you guys use to ship larger orders? Bubble mailers or just PWE? Are there any particular products you guys use that are good for sending multiple cards at once? Right now, with my larger orders being only 3 cards, I just send in PWE with a top loader. Also, do you guys tend to use stamps or do you go into the post office and pay for shipping there? 3. Pricing. How do you guys to price the cards and shipping? I know TCGPlayer is all about competitive pricing, so how do you guys price your cards to get buyers interested without losing money?",

Even when I do manage to do that, it is either 3 times the price of the deck in shipping, hitting the buy button removes five cards, or if i try to optimize it to decrease shipping, it takes out twenty cards. No shit it's cheaper it's not done. Please help. Update: I was able to work on it and got it to $10 under budged. Would have used cardmarket but it was more expensive and they were missing 5 cards. It was 100 card deck but I'm confused because the confirmation email says: \"Your [TCGplayer.com](http://TCGplayer.com) order of Shadowgrange Archfiend and 82 more items has processed.\" This implies that it cut seventeen cards, but they had a list below and I added the cards up and it reached 100.

          "text": "How I failed my first 3 months in eBay dropshipping (and then turned it around) When I started eBay dropshipping, I wasted a good 3 months doing it completely wrong. I was trying to find the perfect products, spending way too much time researching items, analyzing competition, trying to reverse engineer what other sellers were doing. I maybe had like 50 listings up and I was getting like 1 sale every 3 weeks. Looking back, I realize I was just overcomplicating everything. The turning point for me was when I stopped looking for “winning items” and just focused on volume. Instead of guessing what would sell, I started listing as many items as possible every single day. I use Amazon as my supplier and list the same products on eBay with about a 100 to 105 percent markup. Once I shifted into that mindset, things started to move fast. I went from barely any sales to getting multiple sales per day. And now I’ve got over 10,000 active listings and I’m consistently doing between $1,000 and $3,000 in profit each month. No ads, no complicated setup. Just raw volume. Most people underestimate how powerful that impulse buyer behavior is on eBay. People just scroll, see something they like, and buy it. They’re not checking if it’s cheaper on Amazon or thinking too hard. They just hit buy now. So if you have enough listings live, you’ll naturally catch those eyeballs. I usually list about 100 new items per day. It sounds like a lot but once you get into a rhythm it becomes second nature. I also optimize titles so the listings show up in search, but I keep it super simple. The main mistake I see people make is thinking you need to be clever or find secret products. You don’t. You just need to play the numbers game. That’s what finally worked for me.",

          "text": "So I had this interesting situation come up on TCGPlayer recently. I ordered 3 QCSR Emergency Teleport from a seller in April for around $11 each. The expected arrival date came without receiving them, so I messaged seller asking if they had a tracking number (as they should for an order above $30 IMO.) They said they didn’t but offered right off to send me 3 new copies if I still wanted them. I did, so I said that would be fine. Since they offered this right off, I suspected they forgot to send the cards—but whatever. A couple weeks later, still no cards and still no tracking so I opened a case with TCGPlayer before it got too far past the order date where I was able to do so. But I messaged the seller and told them that if the cards ended up still showing up, I would reverse the refund (because I try to be an honest guy). Seller doesn’t respond so I go ahead and just buy another Playset from someone else. Now today (9 days after I opened the case) the cards do arrive—but I see they weren’t post-marked until 2 days AFTER I messaged the seller telling them I would reverse the refund if the cards still arrived. So clearly they finally only sent the cards after I opened the case—so they could force a sale—after they failed to send the cards either of the previous two times they were supposed to. I obviously don’t need the cards anymore. I said I’d reverse the refund—but now I’m just extremely frustrated with how the seller handled this, both by never using a tracking number and by only sending the cards after I opened a case and didn’t need the cards anymore. Would you go ahead and reverse the refund? Would you send the cards back? Negative feedback? Neutral feedback? Some other option? I don’t want my own irritation keep me from being reasonable here.",

Got the package yesterday with no JD, got my other cards and the pack BEFORE my pack that had the JD. Wasn’t aggressive just said “I think there’s a problem. I had the pack with the Jayden Daniels auction #82 ^^ I received my package today and it didn’t have the cards in that pack - I rewatched the video and I was sent the cards in the auction before that one” Followed up again and have sent multiple messages with nothing back. I have all chat messages and the video replay. I bought AND supported his stream before this happened. Looks like I can file a “claim” on whatnot specific to sports cards. This card is potentially hundreds - comps -> one with a scratch went for $375 and a graded one is on eBay for $3000 (prob. high but still) I’m so mad this is what people fear will happen - and I’m so disappointed - any advice/other stories?

Put the card and a Dad Man's Dugout sticker in a team bag. 2. Secure the card between 2 pieces of cardboard for extra stability. 3. Wrap it all with a rubber band to hold everything in place. 4. Include my handwritten thank-you note: I thank the customer for their purchase, ask them to follow my eBay store, Whatnot account, and social media. I also provide 1 or 2 fun facts about the player and ask for their feedback. 5. Place it in a bubble mailer, then nest that inside another bubble mailer for double protection. 6. Add a \"Fragile: Handle with Care\" sticker on the outside. For cards valued under $20, I keep it simpler with a team bag, folded paper case, and painter's tape inside a thank-you card (check my other video for details!). I'll upload more videos soon! I don't expect anyone to do as much as I do; I just wanted to share my process since it’s been safe & effective! eBay: https://ebay.us/m/cF5yJ9 Whatnot: @DadMansDugout / www.whatnot.com/user/dadmansdugout Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/sportscards412 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/ dadmansdugout #SportsCards #TradingCards #CardCollecting #SportsCardCollector #HowToShipSportsCards #SportsCardShipping #CardShippingTips #SecureShipping #DadMansDugout #eBaySeller #WhatnotApp #CardSellerTips #BaseballCards #BasketballCards #CardHobby #SportsMemorabilia",

          "text": "Scarcity Is About Who Owns the Card Scarcity in sports cards is not a print run problem. It is an ownership problem. In this flagship episode, I break down why some cards feel impossible to find while others never stop circulating. The difference is not how many exist. The difference is who owns them and whether they sell. Using real examples from modern, 90s, and vintage cards, Brett walks through how ownership concentration, churn, and collector behavior shape what scarcity feels like in the market. If you want to slow down, stop overpaying for hype, and build a collection with intention, this episode gives you a new lens. One that helps you ask better questions before you spend your money and chase the next card. Check out the awesome software that InfernoRed Technology can build for you.

          "text": "my subreddits There are already a few posts about the strike across reselling groups but I am going to ask again. How is everyone doing sales wise and what have you done to pivot? How are you moving items that typically send lettermail? My sales have been way down. Frustratingly my sales are also down to the US, which would be unaffected by the strike anyways. It’s been an up and down year to begin with but I imagine it’s the strike that’s causing my current slump. I see video games and have more quailty, sellable items than I’ve had all year. I did not go into vacation mode. I set tracked shipping to more popular items and increased my handling time (I have started to drop the handling times again for my tracked shipping items). I have also started to sell on FB. It is annoying but I have sold a few things. I’m just listing bulkier items for now. There’s no fees of course but I can’t get the same prices I get on ebay so it doesn’t really matter. For shipping I have mostly been using Chit Chats. I just tried Stallion but apparently they couldn’t scan my label and charged me $2 to print another one. I was butt hurt about that. Chit Chats has always been reliable but they don’t service everywhere. That’s fine, you just don’t know until you get an order. If they don’t service an area the next courier that does will probably be more expensive again, in my experience. So, how’s everyone else doing?",

I have cards that range in price from $1 to $50ish with few that are more. Various Trading card games. Ive tried to search for the best way to ship these and I cannot find an answer that i feel helps me make a decision. eBay standard envelope seems like a disaster. Ive read of people that have used it for years and no problem. Ive read where the post office wont even accept them. Or buyers claiming DNR because the item never received a scan while in transit. I know ESE doesnt get an acceptance or delivery scan in the normal sense. Only the transit scans. Shipping PWE with a stamp. This is how i ship all my TCG cards under a $25. On there i dont seem to have an problems with DNR. Ive had 1 in 800 sales. I feel like with no tracking on ebay it just invites DNR though. Besides these 2 options what is the best option? If i select Ground Advantage shipping usually shows for potential buyers at $5 or more. Id appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or even rude remarks. I just want to be able to sell these cards effectively without worrying about it after it leaves my hands. Thanks.",

Update: Thank you for the speedy responses! I just started INR case with “I’d like a refund” option. Lesson learned to not wait too long and let eBay step in. — Hello, I am the buyer in this situation. Remove post if not allowed but I’d like to see a more updated response since eBay and USPS changed a lot. I checked and googled. The responses vary (mainly from seller’s perspective but not buyer’s). For context, I purchased a card from a seller with good reputation. Shipped quickly but it stopped in NJ. Sept 19 Purchased Sept 22 Shipped from MI. USPS estimated arrival date is Sept 26. eBay estimated dates between Sept 24-Sept 30. Sept 27 Last location of the scan was in NJ. Sept 28-Oct 1 Statuses are “Arriving Late”, 12am each time. No updates since Oct 1. Oct 8 I messaged this seller about this delayed package. Oct 10 Seller finally responded and made Missing Mail Request. No updates since then. Today’s October 20th so I am close to the 30 days mark so I’d like to know the next step if I plan on getting eBay to step in. The package isn’t crazy expensive like I paid $38 ($34+shipping). I do know that INR cases will close if seller just copy and paste the tracking number which isn’t what I want it to happen. What should I do or should not do? Be specific if possible! Thanks! This is my first time dealing with this USPS mishap as a buyer. I’d really want the refund and buy the same card from another seller (and pray it won’t happen again lol...)

          "text": "my subreddits Going to preface this by saying I mostly sell a modest amount of old trading/TCG cards I used to collect on ebay almost weekly, and I make solid pocket change off it but nothing close to an income off of it. So my normal routine is listing items on Saturday and run the auctions for a week and then pack everything up on Sunday and ship Monday at my local USPS post office. My buyers pay for shipping and I pay for and print out USPS prepaid shipping labels, attach the bubble mailers and drop them off in the dropbox in the post office Monday. I've been doing this for several months with no issues. The items always show as scanned by no later than Tuesday and the item makes it to the buyer. However, this week I have an issue. It is now Thursday and none of my 6 dropoffs from Monday show as scanned yet and I'm getting nervous; one buyer already messaged me about this. Ebay guidelines say to ensure the package(s) has been on its way by July 10th (today). If none of the items change status today... what do I do? I don't see any options to start any kind of case for me as a seller. I know that I can tell the buyer to open a missing package case but I was under the impression there was something I could do as the seller as well. Is this not the case? Most of the time I would have a missing package case it's because tracking updates have stopped; in this case the packages have never even been scanned. And I know that this is a USPS issue but can I get reimbursed if these end up lost and what process do I need to engage in order to do that? These items this week made me a decent amount of money and obviously I shouldn't lose out on hundreds of dollars for an egregious USPS mistake but from what I've seen it doesn't appear there are protections for sellers. Am I wrong? One thing I do notice is that even though none of the items show as scanned, I see that ebay lists the funds as available and the orders complete. This seems odd. Why would this be?

If you're worried about your package, you can create a FedEx account on their website and use the tracking number they provided to change the delivery to pick up at a local FedEx/OfficeDepot or OfficeMax store. Once it's delivered to the store ask if you can open the package their to confirm everything is there due to the cost of the item. That's what I did when I couldn't receive my recent PSA Vault package with a moonbreon and other cards for a few days since it required a signature.",

          "text": "Pay with Consignment Alt Auctions May 30, 2025 Buy Now, Pay with Future Consignments In case you missed it, we introduced a new way to make buying on Alt even more flexible: now you can use a cash advance from upcoming consignments to help pay for auction wins. Whether you’re looking to upgrade your collection or score a grail, this program lets you tap into the value of cards you plan to consign—before they even sell. How It Works Eligible customers can apply the cash advance from their future consignment directly toward the cost of a recent auction purchase. If the cash advance doesn't cover the full amount, you can pay the remaining balance through our standard process. Who’s Eligible? To participate, your consignment must meet these criteria: Cards must be graded or factory sealed Accepted grading companies include: PSA BGS SGC CGC Single-card consignments must be valued at $250 or more If your consignment only covers part of the purchase , the remaining balance must be paid within the standard 14-day auction window Step-by-Step Reach Out to our Alt Experts Contact the Alt Expert team within 5 days of your auction ending to initiate the process through email (support@alt.xyz) or the chat icon in the Alt app. Get a Quote The Sales team will evaluate your cards and send you a batch quote, just like a normal consignment. Approve & Send Once you approve the offer, you’ll receive a cash advance amount. Ship your consigned cards to the Alt Vault within 14 days . Settle the Remaining Balance If your advance doesn’t cover the full purchase, CX will add a charge to your account for the difference. You’ll need to pay that off before we can complete the transaction. Receive Your Cards Once your cards are in and your balance is paid, we’ll transfer your auction winnings to your Alt account. ⚠️ Important: If all steps aren’t completed within 14 days of the auction ending, the purchased cards will be re-listed. Example You win a card for $20,000 . You consign a group of grade",

This intrigued me as I had never heard of this before. Looking into it I guess you don’t have to pay sales tax if you choose to have your slab stored in the PSA vault through eBay. If you plan on re selling the slab, you just keep it in the vault. You don’t have to take new photos. They handle the resell for you.. Seems pretty cool. What are the cons to this besides not actually having your card in hand.",

I have rounded up all my graded/slabbed cards I am hoping to sell... roughly 30 cards with cards ranging from $50-$2500 in value. I have only sold a few things on eBay personally and thought I’d give the PSA Vault a try with the lower commissions and their larger reach for views. Plus taking me out of the equation for shipping etc... now that I’m reading more, I am seeing issues with customer support, listings, duties etc. Has anyone on here, more so Canadians for duties/shipping etc, but even in general.... had a good experience? I also have about 15-20 cards I was planning on sending for grading and then have them transferred to the vault fo resale.... but now I’m reconsidering because I hear you can’t as a Canadian, that the cards will be sent back to you and then you have to pay to reship them to the vault. With all this said, these are just some cards I am trying to offload so I can continue to fund my collection addiction 😝 , not being used as a “business”",

Auctions were smooth as butter, all cards sold at market or above. My only complaint is receiving payment from psa and stripe. Its godawfully slow. I mean like 1970s processing slow. I dont know if its PSA, Stripe, or ebay. My guess its Stripe. But if they dont immediately improve this process. Id be better off auctioning them myself. But other then that I would strongly encourage everyone to utilize this method over selling to PSA, or even vendors. I personally feel this market is going to turn into a competition of who's paying the highest %.",

Now I see that many cards sold on Feb 6th are still in \"payment processing\" status. A couple switched to SOLD already (even from later days) but I cannot seem to find a \"guideline\" for that. Did PSA Vault changed their policy regarding payment processing timeline? I seem to remember someone reached out to support and got a specific answer (i.e. payment is processed xxx days after item shipment or something like that). I am all for quick payments but what really matters to me the most is having clear info (if the new standard is a certain number of days so be it, but I can't find a info anywhere in their pages). Thanks!",

Long story short I’ve been trying to list this card on eBay via the vault. I thought it was a glitch so I tried on a few different days but it wouldn’t go. I reach out to the vault who within 12 hours respond saying that the card was damaged in shipping and I should talk to my mailman about the damage. I said no- my cards were checked for damage at the drop off event by PSA staff and shipped in to the vault by PSA themselves. The card doesn’t actually look damaged if you see the pics but if it is then they need to fix it, their shipping, their insurance. I waited a few days for a response but nothing came, I wrote in again and nothing. I calle customer service, the rep agreed with me and said they would try to get it expedited. Nothing. Original request to them was Jan 19, response Jan 20th. Now it’s Super Bowl Sunday and I have a PSA 10 rookie auto /10 of one of the team stars and I have no card, in hand or on eBay. Moral of the story, don’t use the vault- they have complete shit customer service and don’t use drop off events for vault shipping, because apparently PSA doesn’t know how to safely ship items.",

Unfortunately, I think you are in the minority and I’m talking about the other 99% who aren’t sharing their login or card collection info with family members. Based on PSA’s stance they are going to make it very difficult for family to retrieve cards unless they have an estate plan established. Only 1 in 3 Americans have an estate plan or will set in place and PSA is very vague in their verbiage. All of this could be a moot point if PSA would allow Vault owners to specify beneficiaries, here is what is on their website: “At this time, we do not offer beneficiary forms. Any estate planning, including assigning beneficiaries, would need to be handled separately through your own legal and financial planning. What Happens to My Vault Account If I Pass Away? In the event of a customer's passing, access to the account can only be granted to the legally recognized executor of the estate. To request access, the following documentation is required: Proof of estate management, such as a court order or a record of the deceased person's trust that identifies the individual responsible for overseeing the estate. Please note: We do not accept death certificates as sufficient documentation, as they do not specify the executor of the estate.”",

Clearly they waited to see how he did in the playoffs before deciding to pay, since they have 10 days to do so. He didn't do well. They didn't pay. It's now almost 4 weeks later from the day I accepted. It's still stuck in the eBay \"no stock left\" status. I've watched the PSA offer go from almost what the buyer offered to 40% less (though it went back up now it seems). No response from PSA. They are officially broken.",

I actually live very close to the PSA vault, in Delaware, and offered to drive to the vault to pick them up. It took them almost a week to email me back to say the vault isn’t open the public, my cards need to be removed from the vault through my account portal, or they will ship them back to the seller.

Luckily I got a good deal on it but it just came in and I noticed some edge damage that makes it not look gem mint PSA 10 in my opinion. I’m not sure what to do moving forward. I messaged them on eBay hoping to rectify the situation and I am waiting for a response. But I guess I came here for advice from the community to see what you would do in this scenario. Please let me know what I can do and what you would do! Thank you.",

Alot of them are duplicate cards. I decided to list around 10 per day through the vault on ebay for the next 7 days with a $0.99 auction start. Market value is around 350 per psa 10 with around 7-16 sold daily according to cardladder, ebay sold, and Pricecharting. My goal with this was to get closer to 87% per sale instead of PSA buyback offers of 72%. Essentially im curious if psa auctions typically go way under market in a auction or if the market follows reported sales data. Does anyone else have experience with this?",

          "text": "Vault and eBay In September I went to a PSA submission event at Real Sportscards in Champlain MN, mind that this is a direct PSA event with PSA employees present taking grading and Vault submissions. I did a drop off for a 52 item grading order and submitted another 40ish cards to the vault. PSA was in charge of all packaging and shipping of the vaulted items. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago when I try listing a PSA 10 Jaxon Smith Njigba Panini Legacy Rookie auto pink/gold /10. It won’t list, try it again, it won’t list. Try again the next day, still doesn’t work. I reach out to the vault to find out what’s up and I get a response in about 12 hours. Vault employee tells me the card was damaged during transit to PSA and that I should talk to MY mailman. Uhm no... this was a submission that was transited by PSA from an event, damage insurance coverage is on them. He also sent me a picture of the supposed damage. The card looks exactly like it did in its grade reveal... so #1. I don’t believe that it is damaged at all and that it is just coded wrong and they’re not pulling the card out to actually look at it. I wasn’t notified of any damage when my cards were vaulted. So if it was damaged and couldn’t be sold why would I want it to continue to be in the vault? #2. If it actually is damaged, the rep says specifically in the message that it looks to have been damaged in transit - the cards were all verified prior to the submission with a rep who closely examined them and actually gave me back several other cards he determined to not be eligible for the vault due to damage. So similar to how they force place insurance on us via premiums above the regular fees, what insurance does PSA have on things they ship from events? Compensation is due if the damage was caused by their shipping method. Right? #3. It really sucks to have a vaulted card that could easily bring in multiples of its predicted value due to the Seahawks now going to the Super Bowl. It’s a /10 PSA 10 r",

First noticed I couldn’t bid/buy on any psa (eBay) items about a week ago. No problem bidding on other accounts. Then today had some items I had listed in psa vault sell so tried to login to my account and got the network error people mentioned. I tried logging in with a friends account and it worked fine so clearly my account and not my device. I called eBay support first they said maybe psa set max buy thresholds (which seemed weird at most I buy 2-3 slabs a week but often 0) Called psa number (on hold for 30 min) guy said there was some sort of block on my account but didn’t know why and had to check with IT if he can disable it. Haven’t heard back from him yet but just checked and I can bid/buy psa items now (still can’t send to vault) but psa account still locked out",

Today, I received an offer from PSA to sell one of my cards through PSA Vault, and I accepted the offer and completed the sale. After the sale, I was informed that I cannot receive the payment unless I have a Stripe account. As far as I understand, Stripe payouts are not available in my country. Why is Stripe the only payout option? It feels outdated and extremely restrictive for international users. If I had known that Stripe was required, I would never have accepted the offer or sold the card in the first place. PSA says this is their policy, but allowing international sellers to complete transactions without a valid payout method makes no sense. This is a serious issue, especially for higher-value cards. Has anyone else experienced this problem with PSA Vault or PSA Marketplace as a non\\_toggle international seller? How was it resolved?",

Ain’t no fucking way I’m writing a post like this from scratch, but I do think it’s a good pitch and should be considered. I’m here for good DD, if ai can help, why are we limiting ourselves from discussion? **TL;DR:** Collectors Holdings CEO sits on GameStop’s board for free. PE investors (including Steve Cohen’s family office) need an exit after 5 years. GameStop has $9B+ in cash. The same Steve Cohen who bailed out Melvin Capital in January 2021 may have no choice but to sell Ryan Cohen the dominant force in collectibles authentication. ----- ##The Board Seat That Doesn’t Make Sense (Unless It Does) In November 2024, GameStop appointed Nat Turner—Chairman and CEO of Collectors Holdings—to its Board of Directors. One month earlier, GameStop became an authorized PSA dealer. Ryan Cohen’s board is tight and hand-picked. You don’t get a seat for a dealer agreement. Turner receives no compensation for his board role. He’s the CEO of a company valued at $4.3 billion, sitting on GameStop’s board for free. **Why?** Because when this deal closes, he’ll be one of the largest GameStop shareholders. ----- ##What is Collectors Holdings? Collectors has quietly consolidated the entire collectibles authentication industry: |Brand |Category |Position | |-------|----------------------|-----------------------------| |PSA |Trading cards |#1 globally, 71% market share| |SGC |Trading cards |Acquired Feb 2024 | |Beckett|Trading cards & comics|Acquired Dec 2025 | |PCGS |Coins & currency |Industry leader | |WATA |Video games |Industry leader | |Goldin |Auction marketplace |Premium collectibles | According to GemRate, PSA graded 18.3+ million cards in 2025. **Combined with SGC and Beckett, Collectors now owns 79% of all card grading.** They don’t dominate the market. They ARE the market. ----- ##The PE Exit Clock & Ste",

This item has been refunded.” I’m genuinely confused how an inventory issue is possible with a PSA-graded, serial-numbered card that’s stored in their vault. This isn’t a fungible item—it’s a specific slab with a unique cert number. Has anyone else experienced this with PSA Vault? I’m kind of at a loss here. I didn’t want a refund—I wanted the card.",

To save money from consignment fees compared to directly selling through eBay for cards that are above $100 3. More liquidity. The easier it is to sell, the more likely people will sell their slabs. This could *potentially* raise the value of TAG slabs as they currently sell for around [10% less than their PSA counterparts](https://www.reddit.com/r/taggrading/comments/1o63m3d/charizard_ex_199_tag10_vs_psa10_sold_performance/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Of course, there are exceptions, but this is what I've generally seen on eBay sold listings **PSA gets:** 1. Easy money from consignment fees. PSA's #1 priority, as with any other grading company, is profit. They already accept BGS, SGC, and CGC slabs for the Vault. Adding another grading company to that list wouldn't be hard to implement and the profit margins are huge 2. More PSA membership signups and membership retention I've emailed PSA about this and they said: >Regarding TAG slabs, we currently have no announcements regarding when these will be accepted at the PSA Vault. When and if this occurs, our social media team will make this change public. I figured, if enough people email/poke them about this, they'll see the demand and will eventually make this a reality. I like TAG and I use them for my PC, but a few of my cards I've outgrown and it takes too much work for me in my busy life to sell them myself. At the end of the day, it benefits both PSA for their profits and me as a TAG slab collector",

Collectors Holdings Inc. owns PSA, SGC, and BGS—three of the biggest grading companies in the hobby. Through its subsidiaries, the company also sells cards on eBay, consigns cards on eBay, operates the PSA Vault, and owns Goldin Auctions. On top of that, PSA is the official authenticator for all cards bought and sold on eBay over $250. Lets not forget they also own Card Ladder the leading data analytics platform and price guide for sports and trading cards. So one parent company now has their hands in grading, authentication, storage, auctions, and direct marketplace sales—often inside the same transaction chain. Congress has previously asked the FTC to review potential antitrust concerns related to consolidation in the hobby, but no public findings or actions have been announced. **WHAT DO YOU THINK**",

          "text": "PSA Vault Withdrawal Experience: Consumer Beware I like the general concept of the PSA Vault. Recently I had a few cards that have been in the vault for about 6 months that I wanted to withdraw as gifts for Christmas—I didn’t think it would be a big issue. However after waiting over 2 business weeks for them to ship my cards I received no confirmation. When I reached out the representative said: *We're currently working through a high volume of collectibles, and most orders are shipping within 14-16 business days of the request. However, this is only an estimate, so it's possible it could be slightly sooner or longer.* I asked for the withdrawal to be canceled (they never even left my vault) and they said yes. When I asked for a refund for the withdraw fee and shipping they said they are both non-refundable. I can kind of understand the withdrawal fee being non-refundable but the shipping fee when the item was never shipped should be refunded. I asked to speak to their supervisor and was stone walled—at that point I’m pretty sure I was talking to AI. (Funny how they hire AI customer support but not AI grading). If a bank or brokerage firm did not allow me to withdraw my funds in a timely manner they would be defunct. PSA Vault not having their logistics together enough to simply ship stored items is insane and really diminishes the product as a whole. I’m very disappointed in the withdrawal feature of PSA Vault and seriously makes me reconsider using them as my default shipping location going forward. I just wanted to let you all know this experience in case you were wondering what the withdrawal service was like. **TLDR: PSA Vault has a terrible withdrawal service and I don’t recommend anyone relying on it.**",

I typically win a few and have been paying for everything at once in the evening before bed. Recently, however, it seems that the PSA Store on eBay has a 60-minute auto-pay enabled. Auto-pay itself is fine, but I need all of the cards I purchase to remain in the PSA Vault. The issue is that auto-pay defaults to shipping the cards to my home. Most of the time I catch it in time and change the option, but sometimes I’m busy in the evening and miss the window before auto-pay triggers, preventing me from selecting the vault option. Does anyone know how to turn off the 60-minute auto-pay? Or have the default shipping option go to my vault? I’ve gone through all of my eBay settings and can’t find anything related to this. I’ve also messaged PSA through eBay and contacted eBay support, but so far I’ve only received generic responses with no clear answer. Thanks!",

I then went to a card show in the Bay Area where PSA was having a drop off event. I vaulted around 400 slabs and went on with my life. Fast forward to today, I have Collectors emailing me saying that one of the cards was stolen so they can’t vault it. I show them the receipts, the dates, the invoice that connects to the certification proving that I paid for the card back in July, not knowing that it was a stolen card. Their response is in my photo. It actually makes me wonder if there’s a scam going on somewhere where people are selling their cards to GameStop and then saying it was stolen to pretty much get paid twice. I told the guy from Collectors when you go to trade in or sell something at GameStop they scan your ID and fingerprint you - at least in California. So ostensibly it should be pretty simple to find out who sold it at GameStop. Anyway, I’m not going to pay for the card twice, so at least they’ll ship it to me still.",

          "text": "My contribution to the TAG vs. PSA arguments Been seeing a lot of arguments regarding TAG vs PSA and it always comes around to AI, and how TAG is better because it uses AI. Then come the comments about how it’s not AI, and how garbage it is. Then come the comments about how people sent in PSA 8’s and got PSA 10’s. The list goes on and on. Well here’s my take. TAG: PROS- Unique. Machine learning may be the future of grading and they have built an esthetically pleasing slab, and concept in regard to the 1000 point scale. They want to provide collectors with a new way to collect and they are actively gathering reviews, listen, and working hard to make it better. Turnaround times are short. You pay based on the raw value of the card, and not the post grade value. They value transparency. CONS- Everyone thinks TAG is special because of their “MACHINE LEARNING.” It is NOT artificial intelligence, it is building a massive database of what a 10 is and a what a 9 is. That changes, with every single card scanned. By definition, it isn’t consistent when looking at it over a long period of time. Their slabs are cheap, and break with mild thumb pressure to the center of the slab. They have no vaulting service, and lack the ecosystem to properly track values. Grading is expensive for lower value cards. PSA: PROS- Amazing resell value and massive share of the industry, they ARE and likely will remain the industry standard, regardless of all the haters. Even despite the massive issues regarding the 9s being re-graded into 10s after the customer already accepted the grade 9 payout offers, PSA prices held and there was no noticeable reduction in values. The slabs are durable, yet light. Vaulting service allows seamless selling direct to PSA, or direct to EBAY. Selling from the vault means the buyer on eBay doesn’t pay taxes or shipping (if they send to their vault) and in my experience, this means a better sale price. Better payout percentages through eBay for higher value cards. Gra",

It took a couple weeks for vault shipping to go through but then I experienced weeks of issues and 2 tickets with PSA where no matter how many times I tried to list on EBay, it would never work. After a month of dealing with that, I decided to ship back to me and I’ll sell myself. And the point of the post is this is the current timeframe you can expect shipping from the vault: 15 Nov: Paid to ship from vault, cost $13 total including under 90 day fee. Status changed to “shipped” but did not receive a tracking number. Nothing for almost a month... 12 Dec: I finally cracked and decided to make another ticket. As I was typing of the ticket I decided to check my email one last time and somehow got the shipping info at that exact moment. 16 Dec: card arrived, signature required. Just awareness for anyone waiting on vault shipping so that you don’t panic when weeks go by without hearing anything.",

Instead of doing a pure “look at my company” post, I wanted to share what we’re trying to build and ask if this actually makes sense from a collector’s point of view. Context: collecting from Latin America If you live in the US, you send your cards to PSA/BGS/CGC and that’s it. If you live in most of Latin America, it’s a mess: you ship through intermediaries you pay crazy shipping and customs you wait months and you still don’t have any real digital way to manage your collection I’m trying to solve that problem first, and grading is just the entry point. The project is called OGS (Opulence Grading System), based in Ecuador, but the idea is bigger than just slabbing cards. --- The idea: a “collector tools” platform, not a marketplace clone What we’re building inside the user account is basically: 1. Ownership transfer between users If two collectors trade/sell peer-to-peer, they can move the card from one account to another inside the system. No marketplace, no listing fees – just a record of who currently owns it. 2. Ability to “release” a card If you sell a card outside the platform (show, Instagram, eBay, whatever), you can release it so the next owner can claim it. That way there aren’t 5 people saying “that card is mine” years later. 3. A real collection manager Front/back images, serial, grade details, ownership status – all in one place. Nothing fancy visually yet, but functional. 4. Things we want to add if the base works direct send-to-auction for some houses AI-assisted pre-grading digital vaulting population reports an optional “trust”/reputation layer for peer-to-peer deals optional public profiles for people who actually want visibility This is not meant to replace eBay or MySlabs or anything like that. The goal is simply to give people in this region tools we never had.",

I won an auction for a PSA 10 slab directly from the PSA Vault. The auction ended on Nov. 30 and “tracking” was added Dec. 3. “Tracking” because they gave me a number on the order details but in the actual tracking details it just shows pre-shipment status. Does it usually take this long to ship from the vault or is something off here and I should reach out to them? Thanks in advance if you have any experience to share.",

My 12 year old self wouldn't believe it! I would've thought you'd have to be some well to do sports memorabilia collector. It's such a nostalgic feeling to collect cards, and now GameStop partnered with PSA to help give us Power Packs! This is such a smart way to bring Trading Cards to the future.

The irony’s melting faster than a Charizard under Fire Spin 🔥📈 So PSA just announced it’s now the official vault for eBay — meaning all those graded slabs, signed cards, and holy grails are now living rent-free in corporate cold storage. Cool move, right? But here’s the kicker: GameStop’s been quietly building its own Power Packs + NFT marketplace, already minting authenticated, serialized digital collectibles with on-chain provenance. eBay’s handing PSA their crown jewels... while GameStop’s setting up the damn vault and the metaverse that displays it. One’s playing 2015 FinTech catch-up. The other’s quietly engineering 2030 digital ownership. They can lock their cards in PSA vaults all they want — but the real vault is the balance sheet: 💰 $9.6B in cash + BTC 💎 A DRS army 🦍 A marketplace ready to tokenize everything This isn’t a collectible bubble — it’s the tokenization of tangible nostalgia. And the irony? Wall Street’s still shorting the only player actually holding the keys. 🚀🦍 “They keep vaulting assets. GameStop keeps vaulting the future.”",

I have a few cards vaulted with GameStop power packs and I’m wondering if they will show up in the eBay app as well. I believe this is fairly new and the FAQ says that it can take several weeks if cards to show up. This all makes me think about the underwear that sold on eBay a few months ago. That felt like the beginning of a new partnership. Think about it, other than GameStop, where else would you go to buy used video games? EBay. A partnership with EBay and PSA with card buying and selling + grading + used video games. This could be part of the digital transformation.",

It absolutely had to have been a FedEx worker because i had it held for pickup, so no porch bandits today. Gutted really because the card in question was a miscut shadowless charmander without an MC label that I assume PSA only insured for it’s regular price. So likely I will get like $40 and never get to hold the card in person that I was over the moon about. The worst part is, there is absolutely nothing I could have done to prevent this. I have contacted FedEx and PSA and will see what happens. All I know is my day is ruined.",

Honestly I am not familiar with selling sports cards. I am trying to get rid of old stuff, because I am moving to a new place. I am not too familiar with the value of the cards, and I am not familiar with most of the players. I recently found out about PSA Vault, but am still confused on my next steps. I am trying to save time. Should I send the whole collection to PSA Vault and have them take care of everything? Or should I sift through all the cards and sort what I believe to be valuable, then ship those to PSA Vault? And then sell those \"junk\" cards in bulk on eBay? I just want to make sure I am getting the most amount of money from this collection. I looked through the PSA Vault eBay store, and I see that there are some cards of not-so-famous players selling for a $20+ per card. Please go easy on this ignorant fella, just trying to get rid of old items, thank you LOL. Edit: This collection is from 20+ years ago. All raw cards, no graded. Cards from 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. I stopped collecting around 2002, and it since has been sitting in my closet.",

I presented strong evidence that burgerchu was only being held up by shill bidding, and that when volume pressure (constant PSA vault auction lots of 200+ slabs at once) forced the shill bidders to stop, price would tank and not stop tanking. I had thought an initial floor of $100, but looking at future auctions there are only more and more huge lots coming. When the dust settles, I wonder how many people think that buying these en masse at ~$50 would be a better use of capital than other cards. The card does have a more interesting “story” behind it and will be memorable going into the future, but the signs were clear that buying at 200 or even 300-400+ like many did was a terrible move in the present.",

Grading wasn't really a thing back then so been trying to learn the ins and outs about it. I'm getting ready to get my first cards graded ever... some for my pc, couple others to sell. That being said why is PSA the general go to for grading? I understand that the resale prices are much higher than the others, but can't understand why... just seems you keep resubmit until you get a 10. As a kid, i got the Beckett price guide each month so was kind of surprised to learn how Beckett isn't at least a major contender(?) I've read that it's possibly because the sub grades, and ppl prefer 10 versus 9.5 but the prices can sometimes seem so far apart. Maybe other features things like PSA vault or psa offers are really compelling. From everything I've been reading it feels like Beckett is more consistent in grading, wouldn't that be important for grading? Just generally confused by it all... i know there are other companies as well. I am considering a couple cards for my pc to get graded by tag only because the case looks sleek and i think will display better in the house. I haven't seen anything said about the slabs itself so hopefully they're solid. Any other info or tips is greatly appreciated. I am aware of the submission process and vids they have online. PSA does have an event coming up near me so considering doing a drop off at the event.",

          "text": "Unearthed Gold Star Rayquaza from Childhood Collection I recently found my Gold Star Rayquaza from my childhood collection and I'm trying to figure out the best next step. I've seen recent raw sales on eBay for cards in what looks to be similar or worse condition sell for between $7,000 and $9,000. I'm weighing that against the pros and cons of grading. I'm considering the grading fees, the cost of insuring it for shipping (twice), and the stress of mailing a high-value card. This is before even considering the final seller fees on a platform like eBay. I've never submitted a card for grading before. Based on the photos in the album, what do you think the potential grade range for this card could be? What would you do in my position? Grade it, or sell it as is? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! UPDATE: Wow thanks for all the replies here. After receiving a lot of messages, and reading your posts here I decided to pursue grading the card. Special shoutout to [u/Dracanherz](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dracanherz/) for the IRL **'PSA drop-off event -> PSA Vault' strategy.** I'm running with that... as it removes the shipping concern I had. If I remember I'll come back here and update everyone what the grade ended up being. Thanks again!",

This card for some reason didn't have the checkbox that says \"Transfer to PSA Vault\". So contacted the PSA seller and got the same reply twice. \"Just check the box\". The box isn't there. So contacted Ebay and was bounced around to different support departments. Even one that handles the PSA stuff. Took over an hour and said they would research and email me the conclusion. Problem is it pays and auto-ships in 3 days and don't want it shipped (plus I would be charged tax and a shipping fee). Card is around $100. Anybody experience this before?",

          "text": "Ebay Sent Card to Wrong PSA Vault Email I purchased a card on ebay to send to PSA vault. I do this all the time seamlessly. However, one card has been stuck on \"shipped to PSA vault\" for a long time, and I have not received the confirmation that the card is \"Vaulted\" by PSA. The other problem is that this card never said \"To Vault\" in the PSA app like most cards to when in transit, though it did automatically appear in my collection. I contacted PSA about this issue and they gave me a canned response saying that the card is indeed secured in the vault, but attached to the wrong email. They suggest I make an account to link ebay to PSA, but I have obviously already done that. I used the same ebay email and everything (which is done automatically) that I always do, this cannot possibly be my fault. I'm waiting on their response, but this does not seem promising. Anyone else experience something like this?",

Based on whatever card you hit, you can vault it, do an immediate sale which is usually very fair on more “liquid” cards. NO NEED TO MAIL IT TO YOURSELF TO TRY TO SELL IT AND WASTE A LOT OF TIME. immediate sale! if you link your GameStop and psa account, your collection will instantly show up on the psa app and you still get psa offers too! You can sell directly on there too or just list it for auction or buy price on eBay! love how GameStop is modernizing card collections and chases. In my honest opinion, much better odds of hitting decent cards compared to opening packs of Pokémon! PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GIVE IT A TRY! WISH YALL THE BEST OF LUCK!",

Hype is high, but hard numbers are scarce. This launch is GameStop’s most substantial action in driving revenue growth, taking the company from stabilizing operations to growth focused. The goal of this post is to quantify the potential revenue if the feature scales, lay out every assumption in plain sight, and call out both the upside (PSA partnership, 6 % fee edge) and the obstacles (inventory, eBay’s dominance). **Key facts that anchor the model** |Fact|Why it matters| |:-|:-| |**5.6 M** paying PowerUp Rewards Pro members (56.7 M total)|Built‐in early‐adopter pool| |**600 k+** sports‐card transactions *per week* on eBay (≈31 M/yr)|The market share GME can nibble away at| |**$245 M** of June‐’25 hobby spend flowed through eBay (80 % share)|eBay’s fee load (\\~13 %) is Power Packs’ wedge| |**$211 M** collectibles revenue in GME Q1 FY25 (+55 % YoY)|Cards are already a core pillar—Power Packs just digitises it| |**$33 B** global trading‐card market, growing **22 % CAGR**|Plenty of runway| *(Sources: Shacknews, Chasing Majors, CLLCT, PR Newswire)* **Assumptions you can tweak** * Average selling price (ASP) per pack = $37 * Pack mix = 80% $25 | 15% $50 | 4% $100 | 1% $500 * Instant flip‐rate = 70% of packs * Instant‐sale fee = 6% of 90% cash offer = 5.4% of ASP * Shipping fee (when collectors withdraw) = $5 on 20% of kept slabs * Buyers per month & packs per buyer = see scenarios below **Twelve‐month run‐rate scenarios** *\\*Note: These numbers will take time to reach and the total revenue is for the full year.

Just been digging into Courtyard as a useful comparison with GameStop's new Power Packs/PSA launch. So by way of background, Courtyard (\\[dot\\] io - not sure if I can post a link to it here) is an existing collectibles platform which has been around for from what I can tell just over 7 months. Auctioning a [quarter of a million dollar Charizard](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/12/06/rare-250k-charizard-pokemon-card-going-on-auction-this-friday/) on their platform seems to have been their first big go at publicity from what I can tell and only this week they raised $30 million in a Series A funding round. Here's what they have to say about themselves on a job ad: >Courtyard is the fastest-growing collectibles startup, ever. We are revolutionizing the world of collectibles trading by enabling instant liquidity and delivering a high-velocity, immersive experience. From trading cards to comics, we’re redefining how people discover, collect, and unlock value. >Courtyard is not just another marketplace. All assets are securely vaulted and fully insured, giving collectors peace of mind alongside unmatched speed and simplicity. Whether you’re investing, discovering, or curating your dream collection, we’ve built a platform that’s trusted, simple, and built for speed. >And we’re just getting started. We’re a remote-first company hiring across all functions to push the boundaries of what’s possible in collectibles and digital ownership. Anyway, so like our new platform, they let their customers buy, sell, and trade physical trading cards, comics etc. through their online platform. And it’s growing fast. This year, transaction volume hit 95,000 per day, and in February alone they reported $42.6 million in sales volume. They’ve reported $9 million in revenue and raised $37.1 million total in funding, including the $30 million Series A round previously mentioned. Their model is",

          "text": "The PSA DD You’re Looking For 👀 ##SlabBusters, Push Start Arcade, and the Future of GameStop x PSA: Something Big Is Coming! So GameStop just dropped a new teaser for “Push Start Arcade” in collaboration with PSA. On the surface it looks like a stylish arcade-themed collectible tie-in. But if you’re actually paying attention—like, really paying attention—this is the most intentional signaling we’ve seen from GME yet. Let me walk through what I think they’re telegraphing, why “SlabBusters” isn’t just a meme, and how this may be setting the stage for a full-blown transformation of how physical collectibles are authenticated, traded, and stored—with GameStop sitting dead center in the middle of the slab economy. ⸻ ###First, the Setup We’ve got a neon PSA x GameStop terminal front and center with the phrase “Push Start” above it. There’s a glowing vault aesthetic, “Vault Rules” on the wall, and a character about to interact with the machine. On the wall is a very intentional Ghostbusters parody that says “SlabBusters”—using a stylized bunny inside a red strike-through like the classic logo. And just beneath it, what looks like a movie poster, complete with credits. Not just branding—storytelling. We also see nods to Pokémon, One Piece, basketball culture, and arcade nostalgia all crammed into a single frame. This is a fusion of collectible culture, gaming culture, and retail logistics. Nothing about it feels accidental. ⸻ ###Now, What Is a “SlabBuster”? At face value, a slab is a graded card inside a tamper-proof plastic case. PSA, CGC, Beckett—these are the grading companies that validate a card’s condition and seal it into a “slab,” giving it liquidity, status, and price anchoring in the secondary market. So what does it mean to be a “SlabBuster”? In one sense, it could be a jab at people who crack open slabs to resubmit for regrades or flip into other grading systems. But in this context, it feels like something bigger. Something structural. GameStop isn’t just mocki",

          "text": "PSA Vault Review Pros and Cons !! Hello everyone, I know there was a post a couple months back on getting started using the vault, but I wanted to give my in depth review along with some big pros and cons that you may not be aware of if you arent an active user. I have most of my collection stored there and have been using it pretty much since it started up. Hope this helps some people. The Good: * One of their biggest selling points on the vault is being tax free, since it is located in DE. If you withdrawal early you will still have to pay a fee, but it is negligble compared to the taxes you would pay on high end cards. After 90 days of being vaulted you don't pay this fee. * You can receive cash offers from within their PSA network. Zero fees with immediate payment. The offers can range from laughable lowballs, but occassionaly you might get a really strong one at 90-100% market. For reference I have only accepted two offers this way. From what I understand the \"network\" is mostly businesses trying to obtain inventory, I am guessing they have to pay some sort of subscription/prove they are an actual business to join, but Idk. If someone here is part of it and has more insight would love to know. * You can change listings in real time. This market is changing faster than ever and extremely volatile. If you have sent a consignment with BIN pricing other places, that same price may not hold up by the time it is listed, not an issue with the vault. * You can ship directly from your vault to a private buyer. * For older Certs they will give you the high res scan if one dosent already exist. * Liability is not on you anymore. I know many of yall have sweated watching the tracking of something sent out, Ik I have. * They also provide really convenient data with recent solds, may not always be 100% up to date or accurate approximations of value, but can be helpful as a starting point in figuring out how to price. * The fees are cheaper than selling a card by yourself on ",

          "text": "PSA lost vault card purchased on eBay. Reimbursement offered is under purchase price. EDIT: They are “now” reimbursing full value. TLDR: I bought a rare, low pop slab already in the vault from PSA on eBay for $830. PSA lost it en route to me when I “withdrew” it from the vault the same day. They are now only offering $500 due to comps in the form of a check or credits. Apparently my own comp of $830 is not sufficient. PSA can up charge us all day for card values and what not, yet when it’s time to payout for loss, they’re stingy. My problem with this is the disconnect between eBay and PSA in a short amount of time. I understand the two entities are separate and provide different services, but when they are so heavily advertised as being a seamless experience, it should be handled differently. To preface, I’ve sold AND bought dozens if not now over a hundred items back and forth to the vault and through eBay authentication. I’ve either bought/sold a slab directly in the vault, or had something shipped from the seller/myself to the vault to save on taxes. This is the first time I’ve ever had an issue. I understand that when something is held in the vault for a while, it may rise or diminish based on current comps, but when something was withdrawn from the vault on the same day of purchase from eBay, I think that should be handled differently. Had I purchased something shipped directly from a seller or even in the case of the authenticators, eBay would have reimbursed me the full amount, which I’ve already had happen before. In this case where the sale was initiated on eBay, but the loss was WITH PSA, I am screwed with a comp $330 less than my purchase price, and apparently my own comp is not sufficient.",

Now help me understand how could something in the vault be all of a sudden out of stock or damaged? How did the items end up in auction if it’s no longer in the vault? Did psa deem the price too low and kept the card themselves? Did the system break down this quickly that staff is already stealing or they can’t even locate or secure their inventory no more? I have about 30k worth of cards vaulted. Everything’s been smooth until now. Now I’m a bit concerned.",

They're in great condition, in books, sleeves, breaks, etc. In just going through some, for example, I have a many good Jordan, Montana, various decent rookie cards, Star Trek, Pokeman, etc. I've looked into getting some of these graded and it seems as though psa is the \"top\" or at least most used service out there. Have any of you used this and how does it work? Do I send my cards to PSA and they grade them and hold them until sold? Is this secure? Does anyone have experience with this? Really curious as in looking at pricing, the grading process can get pretty pricey pretty quick. The payoff can be great, but out of pocket up front can go from $50 to $350 once it gets to them if I have a good card. For the Mods, I have googled and checked on eBay a few times; cannot seem to get a detailed idea of what EXACTLY the process is (definitely may be me). Feel free to remove if you can point me in the right direction with a link or info. \\*\\*Yes, I have an active eBay store as well as some other channels for eCommerce. :) Thanks!!",

I won an auction for this card (a little over $100), seller being PSA and the card listed as being in the PSA vault. That was 2 weeks ago. I originally messaged because it had been like 4 days and never moved from paid to shipped, and they responded quickly and just said it has not been shipped but should arrive within the window of time. Now it is well past the window with no update (2 weeks). I have messaged 3 more times over this last week with no response. I opened a case with EBay that the item has not arrived. Funny thing is I won 2 other PSA auctions around the same time and both of those were processed and shipped normally. IDK if there is anything to be done at this point. EBay says they will step in on April 1. I’m guessing this ends with me just getting a refund but I want to know what BS is going on PSA / PSA Vaults end? Like did they lose this persons card and now can’t complete the sale and just went dark? Or does the original owner that had it in the vault have to OK the sale? I left negative feedback but obviously that is no real repercussion for them.",

          "text": "I have a few slabs in the PSA Vault atm. I see on their website, their consignment fees for selling from their vault to eBay ranges depending on value of the slab. The lowest rate is 7% for a $5000+ sale, and the highest rate is 16% (minimum $5) for an under $100 sale. From what I can tell, the fees for higher cost cards seem very competitive. At least cards that would sell at $1000+. Cheaper than eBay fees, or other 3rd party consignor fees. It's also cheaper than fees on other vault sites like fanatics collect or onlyalt for example. PSA Vault also offers Goldin rates but it seems a lot higher. Under $7500 sale price on Goldin (through PSA Vault) says they take the full buyers premium of 20% from the hammer price. Besides the 7%-16% fee, is there anything else to consider here in terms of fees/costs? Why would anyone want to sell through Goldin over eBay when the fees are higher on Goldin regardless of sales price? I'm assuming Goldin gets a large audience of wealthy bidders maybe? But thought I should ask before making assumptions",

Am I able to even withdraw it and get the card? If so how long will it take if I buy it and then it goes to the vault then to me because I know how long PSA can take sometimes.

I am getting really irritated with this and am starting to wonder if my card is really in the psa vault at all. I just emailed support but have no idea if theyre going to even help me. Are you able to put your cards on psa ebay auction now?",

Looking into it I guess you don’t have to pay sales tax if you choose to have your slab stored in the PSA vault through eBay. If you plan on re selling the slab, you just keep it in the vault. You don’t have to take new photos. They handle the resell for you.. Seems pretty cool. What are the cons to this besides not actually having your card in hand.",

Auctions were smooth as butter, all cards sold at market or above. My only complaint is receiving payment from psa and stripe. Its godawfully slow. I mean like 1970s processing slow. I dont know if its PSA, Stripe, or ebay. My guess its Stripe. But if they dont immediately improve this process. Id be better off auctioning them myself. But other then that I would strongly encourage everyone to utilize this method over selling to PSA, or even vendors. I personally feel this market is going to turn into a competition of who's paying the highest %.",

After the sale, I was informed that I cannot receive the payment unless I have a Stripe account. As far as I understand, Stripe payouts are not available in my country. Why is Stripe the only payout option? It feels outdated and extremely restrictive for international users. If I had known that Stripe was required, I would never have accepted the offer or sold the card in the first place. PSA says this is their policy, but allowing international sellers to complete transactions without a valid payout method makes no sense. This is a serious issue, especially for higher-value cards. Has anyone else experienced this problem with PSA Vault or PSA Marketplace as a non\\_toggle international seller? How was it resolved?",

Recently, however, it seems that the PSA Store on eBay has a 60-minute auto-pay enabled. Auto-pay itself is fine, but I need all of the cards I purchase to remain in the PSA Vault. The issue is that auto-pay defaults to shipping the cards to my home. Most of the time I catch it in time and change the option, but sometimes I’m busy in the evening and miss the window before auto-pay triggers, preventing me from selecting the vault option. Does anyone know how to turn off the 60-minute auto-pay? Or have the default shipping option go to my vault? I’ve gone through all of my eBay settings and can’t find anything related to this. I’ve also messaged PSA through eBay and contacted eBay support, but so far I’ve only received generic responses with no clear answer. Thanks!",

          "text": "Been seeing a lot of arguments regarding TAG vs PSA and it always comes around to AI, and how TAG is better because it uses AI. Then come the comments about how it’s not AI, and how garbage it is. Then come the comments about how people sent in PSA 8’s and got PSA 10’s. The list goes on and on. Well here’s my take. TAG: PROS- Unique. Machine learning may be the future of grading and they have built an esthetically pleasing slab, and concept in regard to the 1000 point scale. They want to provide collectors with a new way to collect and they are actively gathering reviews, listen, and working hard to make it better. Turnaround times are short. You pay based on the raw value of the card, and not the post grade value. They value transparency. CONS- Everyone thinks TAG is special because of their “MACHINE LEARNING.” It is NOT artificial intelligence, it is building a massive database of what a 10 is and a what a 9 is. That changes, with every single card scanned. By definition, it isn’t consistent when looking at it over a long period of time. Their slabs are cheap, and break with mild thumb pressure to the center of the slab. They have no vaulting service, and lack the ecosystem to properly track values. Grading is expensive for lower value cards. PSA: PROS- Amazing resell value and massive share of the industry, they ARE and likely will remain the industry standard, regardless of all the haters. Even despite the massive issues regarding the 9s being re-graded into 10s after the customer already accepted the grade 9 payout offers, PSA prices held and there was no noticeable reduction in values. The slabs are durable, yet light. Vaulting service allows seamless selling direct to PSA, or direct to EBAY. Selling from the vault means the buyer on eBay doesn’t pay taxes or shipping (if they send to their vault) and in my experience, this means a better sale price. Better payout percentages through eBay for higher value cards. Grading costs are still reasonable, especially f",

Hype is high, but hard numbers are scarce. This launch is GameStop’s most substantial action in driving revenue growth, taking the company from stabilizing operations to growth focused. The goal of this post is to quantify the potential revenue if the feature scales, lay out every assumption in plain sight, and call out both the upside (PSA partnership, 6 % fee edge) and the obstacles (inventory, eBay’s dominance). **Key facts that anchor the model** |Fact|Why it matters| |:-|:-| |**5.6 M** paying PowerUp Rewards Pro members (56.7 M total)|Built‐in early‐adopter pool| |**600 k+** sports‐card transactions *per week* on eBay (≈31 M/yr)|The market share GME can nibble away at| |**$245 M** of June‐’25 hobby spend flowed through eBay (80 % share)|eBay’s fee load (\\~13 %) is Power Packs’ wedge| |**$211 M** collectibles revenue in GME Q1 FY25 (+55 % YoY)|Cards are already a core pillar—Power Packs just digitises it| |**$33 B** global trading‐card market, growing **22 % CAGR**|Plenty of runway| *(Sources: Shacknews, Chasing Majors, CLLCT, PR Newswire)* **Assumptions you can tweak** * Average selling price (ASP) per pack = $37 * Pack mix = 80% $25 | 15% $50 | 4% $100 | 1% $500 * Instant flip‐rate = 70% of packs * Instant‐sale fee = 6% of 90% cash offer = 5.4% of ASP * Shipping fee (when collectors withdraw) = $5 on 20% of kept slabs * Buyers per month & packs per buyer = see scenarios below **Twelve‐month run‐rate scenarios** *\\*Note: These numbers will take time to reach and the total revenue is for the full year.

          "text": "'90s Demand Is Different: Josh Adams on PMGs, Patience, and Playing the Long Game What is really happening in the '90s category right now? Josh Adams from 90s Auctions joins me to break it down. We talk about healthy growth, why some grails spike and then cool off, and what collectors misunderstand when they look at big comps in isolation. We unpack the recent 1998 Metal Universe Peyton Manning PMG sale and why the PSA 8 brought $24K while BGS copies trailed far behind. Is it a PSA premium? Timing? Platform? Or something deeper about collector cards versus commodity cards? Josh shares how he thinks about patience, consolidation, and why he stops checking comps once a card hits his PC. We also walk through key pieces from his collection, including a 1998 PMG Frank Thomas, 1997 Diamond Dimensions Jordan, and a 1997 Essential Credentials Future Jordan he consolidated heavily to land. If you care about scarcity, availability, and building a collection that lasts, this one is for you.

          "text": "MEGA EPISODE: Inside PSA’s Spotlight Auction and a 90s Collector’s Conviction with Andy (@byebyebabycards) This is a two-part episode about conviction in a hobby that rarely slows down. I start with Justin Wickizer , Director of Marketplace at PSA , to unpack the thinking behind the PSA Vault Spotlight Auction. We talk about why PSA is leaning into curated auctions, how attention and storytelling shape outcomes, and what it means when high-end cards meet the reach of eBay. This part of the conversation pulls back the curtain on how institutions think about trust, visibility, and collector behavior in today’s market. Then the episode shifts from infrastructure to instinct. I’m joined by Andy to talk about building a 90s collection right now. Not from a hype angle, but from a place of intent. Andy shares how he approaches rarity, why research matters more than speed, and how patience and refinement have reshaped his collection over time. Together, these conversations explore the same question from two angles. How do you collect with confidence when everything around you is loud?

For example if i buy a card from an ebay seller who personally holds the card and i have ebay send it to the vault, how can i verify that there's no issues with the card? I will never see the card myself. I know ebay mentions \"image scan\" and \"authenticity check\" but i don't have much information on this. Do they scan the card for me to verify the quality? Do they do an authenticity check to see if the slab has been tempered with or does this only happen when a buyer purchases from a seller whose item is already in the vault?",

By Will Stern — July 18, 2024 Share When it comes to authenticity, the world of TV and film memorabilia is a special case. Unlike a baseball jersey — which was either worn by the player or not — many of the most iconic props from cinematic history are far more complicated. Movie props are rarely produced as a one-off. It's common for films such as \"Castaway\" to produce many examples of famous props, such as the film's iconic volleyball, Wilson, which has become a mainstay of the auction scene in recent years. Appearing at multiple auction houses, often multiple times per year, examples of Wilson come with varying degrees of documentation. Given the proper disclosures, this wouldn't be an issue. But, for novice collectors, a reading of the lot description merely describes the prop as the one from the film, so they could reasonably assume it is the only example in existence. Of course, given the difference in value between owning a one-of-a-kind item and a one-of-many item, this can cause major issues. A close viewing of the film will reveal the volleyball changes throughout the movie, not simply as star Tom Hanks converts it into a lifelike character, but even in smaller degrees in-between. Each of these changes could represent its own distinct prop, leaving room for dozens of authentic examples from the film, none more legitimate than the next. The key for auction houses such as Propstore, as well as Julien's and Heritage, both of",

(Credit: Getty Images) By Ben Burrows — August 06, 2025 Share The owner of a Philadelphia marketing and booking firm pleaded guilty Tuesday to four charges related to the selling of forged Jason Kelce memorabilia valued at an estimated $200,000. Overtime Promotions owner Robert Capone, 51, of Philadelphia, pleaded guilty in Montgomery County (Pennsylvania) Court on Tuesday to conspiracy to commit theft by deception, theft by deception and deceptive business practices, all third-degree felonies, and forgery, a first-degree misdemeanor. Restitution will be determined following a pre-sentencing investigation into victim impact. Capone, along with LeeAnn Branco, 43, of Bristol, Rhode Island, and Joseph Parenti, 39, of Cranston, Rhode Island, were charged with 60 felony counts by the Montgomery County District Attorney in January. Charges against Branco, an independent contractor for Beckett Authentication, and Parenti, owner of memorabilia store Diamond Legends, were withdrawn in June following new evidence that showed the two weren’t part of the forgery scheme. Charges originally alleged Capone conspired with Branco and Parenti to forge more than 1,100 pieces of memorabilia with fake Kelce signatures. The items were purportedly signed by Kelce, a former Philadelphia Eagles offensive lineman and Super Bowl champion, at the Valley Forge Casino Hotel in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, on June 11-12, 2024. The forged items were later sold by Overtime Promotions and Diamond Legends. Alfred P. Sicoli, 51, of Pennde",

(Credit: G.O.A.T. Authentics) By Darren Rovell — September 08, 2024 Share For at least 30 years, the most forged autograph in the world has been Michael Jordan. At third-party authenticator James Spence Authentication, vice president Jimmy Spence says he sees at least one fake MJ autograph every single day. The percentage of Jordan signatures Spence says he fails is an astounding 95 percent — 30 percent higher than the next highest, Tiger Woods. As retail prices for Jordan memorabilia have skyrocketed — Upper Deck sold a signed basketball for $699 in 1994; the cheapest today is $7,999 — fraudsters have swooped in like never before. And because of some holes in the authentication process, they are getting away with selling counterfeit items at record levels. The quality of fake Jordan autographs has improved over the last several years. This one? Not so much. (Credit: G.O.A.T. Authentics) For years, Jordan's signature alone proved to be a safety measure of sorts, as his \"M\" and \"J\" were challenging to forge. But autopens got better, and so, too, did the humans. And the authenticity measures? They haven't changed. In 1992, Upper Deck joined forces with then-Los Angeles Kings owner Bruce McNall to create Upper Deck Authenticated. The company took athletes it already had deals with — including Mickey Mantle, Reggie Jackson, Wayne Gretzky, Joe Montana and others — and came up with a \"pate",

I did an unboxing video so there is proof that the slab was already damaged when it arrived. Contacted both seller and called ebay but no resolution was reached. Unfortunately, I was on vacation and was not able to open a case within 3 days of delivery and am unable to file a return or item not as described case.

It is going through Ebay's authenticity guarantee verification per the normal process, my question is does anyone know what will happen? Will PSA still authenticate the slab and seal it with an authenticate sticker, will they send it back to the seller, or send it to me the buyer without the sticker saying they can't authenticate? I understand there is no way they will authenticate the signature, which is fine I don't really care. But will they authenticate the slab and card itself? If anyone knows please let me know, being the idiot I am, only thought about this after I paid, and the slab already enroute to PSA authentication. Thank you",

I sold an authentic designer handbag on eBay. The bag itself passed eBay Authentication with no issue. I did not request authentication — the transaction was automatically routed into the Authenticity Guarantee program by eBay / the buyer. Along with the bag, I shipped handmade leather replacement straps. These were: not counterfeit not branded lawful personal property packaged separately disclosed as non-original accessories After authentication, I was notified that while the bag passed, the handmade straps would be discarded and not returned to me. At no point during listing or checkout was there a clear, prominent disclosure that lawful accessories could be destroyed without compensation. There was no checkbox, warning screen, or affirmative acknowledgment explaining that this could happen. Any reference appears to be buried in fine-print terms. I understand authenticators removing non-original items from the shipment — but permanently discarding seller property without a return option (even at seller’s expense) feels like a disclosure and consent problem. I’m sharing this so other sellers know: Do not include replacement or handmade accessories with items routed to authentication Even if they’re legal and disclosed, they may be discarded You may not have opted into authentication, but you’re still bound by its terms",

          "text": "Sent a $600+ Pokemon card to eBay Authenticator in USPS Priority Small box, they sent it back in a beat up bubble mailer. Is this normal? I’m looking for some insight from anyone who has received a card from eBay’s Authenticity Guarantee. I sold a high-value raw Pokemon card ($600+) and took every precaution shipping it to the authenticator. I used a USPS Priority Mail small box, lined with foam and packing paper, with the card securely protected in a sleeve and card saver between two foam pieces. The card was rejected for \"Listing Accuracy.\" While I understand their standards are strict, I feel the need to specify that I didn't hide anything about this card. I specifically called out a small surface dimple on the back border in the description and included a dedicated close-up photo of it. When it arrived yesterday, the mailer was torn and had visible punctures. Even worse, the inspector’s notes were contradictory: they verified the card is 100% authentic, but then added a note saying \"please update your listing to reflect that the card is altered.\" I pulled this card from a pack myself and have not modified it. I'm not sure I understand why they believe it was altered. Maybe because they didn't like the small surface dimple, but I had already disclosed in the listing. It seems okay upon first look, but I'm stressed that a $600 card was treated so carelessly by the people paid to protect the transaction. A few questions for the group: 1. Is it normal for eBay to basically downgrade shipping from a box to a mailer on returns? 2. Has anyone else had a pack-fresh card labeled \"altered\" by an eBay authenticator? 3. If I find any damage upon closer inspection, what is the best way to hold eBay/the authenticator accountable since they discarded my original protective packaging? Appreciate any advice or shared experiences.",

I’m not trying to sell here, just trying to understand where people would recommend getting something like this appraised and what a realistic value range might be? I sent pics and etc to Goldin and the range they gave me was crazy. Like anywhere from a few thousand to like 20 thousand. Which I was like.. I dunno. Seems like a wide range.

The listing explicitly included multiple (3) strap options and an OEM stainless bracelet, which was one of the main reasons I bought this specific watch at the price I paid. The watch just went through authenticity this morning. eBay confirmed that the watch itself is authentic, but flagged a “listing accuracy issue” and stated that the additional strap and bracelet couldn’t be verified and would not be included in the shipment. They gave me the option to accept it without the additional strap and bracelet, or receive a full refund. The problem is that if I want to accept it and just buy a replacement bracelet and strap, just based on a quick search, looks like it’ll be $600-700. So by accepting it, I’m basically overpaying for just the watch head and one strap. Has anyone else had eBay authentication remove things that were clearly shown and described in the listing? Did you accept the item, return it, or get a price adjustment? This is my first time buying from eBay so I’d appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance",

He wrote back and said he bought it from an eBay seller a few weeks prior and sent a picture of the listing which has a heritage reference number and says it is 39mm. This watch made it through the “Authentication” process and was delivered. There is no way they looked at this watch because at the very least the reference number in the listing was not 79000. This seller says the authentication card says BB58. Makes me question if buying from EBay is safe",

The item sold is custom jewelry. Hello, looking for some insight here. I sold an expensive item (10k+) on May 9th, 2025. Item was delivered to buyer on May 13th, 2025. I received the \"Buyer has filed a dispute with their payment institution\" on October 7th, 2025. I challenged the dispute the same day, stating it was past the return policy (14 days) and past the eBay 30 day policy, and the fact that I encouraged the buyer to open a return and I would accept if the buyer was not happy with the size, color, or for any reason. The buyer reason: \"The item doesn't match the description in your listing\" Buyer comments: \"I messaged the seller but he's not responding\" Buyer messaged once saying \"hello\" on September 29th. Account age: 19 years old 100% buyer feedback 18 items sold 100% feedback (all items 5k-10k) Item was not in ebay's authenticity guarantee program, I do have a ebay \"store\". I sold another item for $7k 2 weeks prior to the dispute, and now ebay is obviously witholding my funds for that item. Has anyone been through this for this large of an amount and this later on after delivery? Do i have any recourse with ebay other than the \"appeal\"? Can I expect eBay to protect me/ban this buyer from the platform? Basically, from what I've read on chargebacks, the scammer will most likely get to keep my 12k item, while ebay reimburses using by 7k payout, so im essentially out 20k+?",

Second and third pictures are from other eBay listings of the same card in PSA Slabs. Aside from the fact that the card in the BGS slab is just a completely different picture all the details of the card are slightly off. The 1st bowman logo is missing its blue outline around the “1st”, the B in the Chrome logo is missing the classic stitching across the top of the B. The icing on the cake though is the Mariners logo on the bottom left, not a single letter is even decipherable. The worst part about this though is it is currently listed for $13,000 by a seller with over 1,400 positive feedback and over 2,000 items sold. Not posting the seller details or anything because like I said, they seem to be a reputable seller and have only positive reviews.

They gave it to me and it led to a BGS Charizard 8.5 1st edition. Okay checks out right? Oh wait, but then I notice that the sub grades are different than the one in the listing! Look for yourself. 3rd: BGS says THICK STAMP. Listing says THIN. 4th: They were in the UK. I’ve seen other posts of fake cards coming from there. Probably makes getting money back + returns harder. 5th: Listing only had one photo. No back photo. 6th: Sellers past items have never been cards. Last review was from over a year ago. If I was scamming, I would probably buy an old account that has a positive feedback history instead of a new account. Anyone have any thoughts? Are these red flags not valid?",

I purchased a trading card for ~$1800. Authentication Guarantee was a part of this. At some point in the process there were some damaging depressions made in the card. These damages were very clearly not there in the seller’s photos, but were present when it was delivered to me. This is a one-of-a-kind card, so there is no possible dubious swapping going on. Ebay has suggested essentially that I relist and sell the card in an auction on the site, and that they would reimburse me for the differences in what I paid and the proceeds from the sale. They will not allow me to just return the card. Has anyone else ever experienced this? It just seems odd to me, and I question whether I can trust eBay to follow through with their side of this. How they’ve treated this so far, I don’t feel confident in their processes. EDIT: upon re-reading their recent message, they’re actually only offering to reimburse me for the fees to resell it.

          "text": "Passion to Profession: How MC Sports Cards Built a High-End Consignment Brand on eBay Trust does not come from volume. It comes from choices made over time. In this episode of Passion to Profession, I sit down with Mike from MC Sports Cards to talk about how reputation became the foundation of his business. We get into why he chose quality over scale, how referrals built a powerful network effect, and what it really takes to earn trust when handling five and six figure cards. We also break down high-end cards on eBay, the impact of Authenticity Guarantee, MC Mondays, and why sometimes the best way to build trust is to say no to business. If you care about long-term relationships in the hobby, this one is for you. A special thank you to eBay for sponsoring Passion to Profession . The biggest and best marketplace to buy your next favorite trading card.

          "text": "What Makes Something Collectible? Inside the Stories, Scarcity & Culture That Create Value What makes something collectible? Is it scarcity? Nostalgia? Cultural relevance? Or the story behind it? In Episode 45 of Collector Nation, Ryan Alford brings together powerful moments from past conversations to explore one central idea: collectibles aren’t just objects — they’re memory, culture, and meaning. Ryan walks us through how everyday moments evolve into prized artifacts, whether it’s championship confetti becoming physical history, jerseys carrying emotional identity, hip-hop memorabilia reshaping what collecting looks like, or photo matching proving provenance and story. Featured guests include: DJ Skee — on how overlooked items like championship confetti become historical artifacts Dan Jamison (Icons.com) — explaining why jerseys represent identity, legacy, and emotional connection Alex Bruh (Wax Poetics) — expanding collectibles beyond sports into hip-hop and cultural memorabilia John Robinson (Resolution Photo Matching) — showing how story and verification dramatically increase value Tareq Nazlawy (CEO of Trace / Fidgetal Collectibles) — offering a look into the future of digital-meets-physical collecting Ryan ties it all together with one truth: not everything valuable starts valuable — and not everything rare becomes meaningful. Collectibles are about moments, memory, and culture.

          "text": "From Plastic Slabs to Fine Art: How M1nt is Revolutionizing Trading Cards | Brian Pirrip The sports card hobby has a problem — it forgot how to be fun. In this episode of Collector Nation , Ryan Alford welcomes Brian Pirrip , founder of Mint, for a deep dive into how innovation, storytelling, and premium design are redefining what it means to collect. Brian shares how frustration with cheap plastic slabs led him to build something entirely new: museum-quality cases made from steel and glass, paired with NFC and blockchain technology that permanently records provenance, ownership, and history. These aren’t just cases — they’re experiences. But this conversation goes beyond hardware. It’s about restoring dignity to great cards, preserving memories, and bringing joy back to collecting. From ripping packs with legendary athletes to building community-driven hobby shops, Brian explains why the future of the hobby depends on creativity, authenticity, and fun — not just price charts. In this episode, we cover: Why sports cards deserve better presentation How Mint G1 cases eliminate counterfeiting The role of technology in preserving history Why fun and community matter more than speculation What innovation actually looks like in the hobby Where sports card collecting is heading next If you’ve ever felt like the hobby needs some upgrades, this product is part of the next wave of innovation.

          "text": "my subreddits Hello, I wasn’t quite sure where to post this, as I’m still in shock and disbelief. I recently purchased a collectible card a Dodgers x One Piece card that was described as being in NM/Mint condition. Upon opening the mail, I noticed a massive dent and crease on the bottom right corner. This card is nowhere near NM/Mint condition, as that damage completely destroys its value. I’ve been an eBay member for 15 years, with hundreds of 100% positive reviews. This is the first case I’ve ever opened. eBay has stated that, because the card went through their authenticity program, the item cannot be returned or refunded. This suggests that either the seller was aware of the damage, or the authenticator failed to properly inspect the card — meaning eBay likely skimmed through the process without adequate authentication. I’ve tried contacting the seller multiple times but haven’t received a single response. I also took numerous photos and even recorded a video of myself opening the sealed mail from start to finish, clearly showing the damage to the card. I spent $1,200 on this card before the Dodgers won the World Series, so there would be no reason for me to damage it myself or attempt to return it afterward. Again, I have full photo and video evidence and want to bring this issue to the public’s attention. Since this was such a significant purchase, I’m willing to take this further even reporting it to the news if necessary. Yes, I’m willing to spend additional money if it means proving my innocence in this purchase. This is incredibly shady business and not how proper authentication should work. Authenticators should take clear, detailed photos of the card front, back, corners, everything. I am appealing this case, and I refuse to lose it. If anyone has any advice or suggestions on what else I can do, please let me know. I truly appreciate everyone who took the time to read this. CASE NUMBER: 1-499645782094",

(Credit: Mister Mancave) By Darren Rovell and Kevin Jackson — July 17, 2025 Share The Hamilton County Coroner's Office identified autograph dealer Brett Lemieux, 45, as the man found dead when police executed a search warrant into a scheme involving fake sports memorabilia in Westfield, Indiana. In a release Thursday, the coroner listed the cause and manner of death as pending, but in a statement Wednesday, Westfield police attributed \"a self-inflicted gunshot wound\" as the cause of death. A Facebook post attributed to Lemieux on the \"Autographs 101\" group sent shockwaves through the sports autograph industry Wednesday morning. In the post allegedly written by Lemieux, he detailed a huge counterfeiting business that sold more than four million items and surpassed $350 million in sales. The crux of the autograph forging operation was based in faking holograms of the largest companies in the hobby, including Panini, Fanatics, Tri-Star, James Spence Authentics, Mill Creek Sports, GT Sports Marketing and others. Lemieux’s primary business was called Mister Mancave, which says on its website that it offers “the largest framed jersey inventory on the web.” A Facebook page for Mister Mancave says the business is located in Columbus, Ohio, but no records of a physical store there exist. Mister Mancave has been incorporated twice in Indiana between 2018 and 2023. In the post attributed under his name, Lemieux said after Kobe Bryant died in January 2020, his company pu",

(Credit: Getty Images) By Darren Rovell — December 12, 2025 Share Sotheby's has altered its strategy for selling game-used NBA jerseys in an attempt to better capitalize on specific players and teams. \"In the past, we would get in the product and would quickly turn it around and sell it,\" Brahm Wachter, the auction house's head of modern collectibles, told cllct. \"Now, we are saying that it pays for us to wait for major moments or in-season catalysts before doing so.\" Wachter announced on social media this week that Sotheby's was holding back Oklahoma City Thunder jerseys, as the defending NBA champions make a run at the best regular-season record of all time, owned by the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors (73-9). The Thunder are currently 24-1. Wachter also said Sotheby's has held back the sale of some rookies' NBA debut jerseys. \"The season is long, and a lot of things can happen that can make that young player's jersey more valuable.\" Wachter said, adding that other jerseys from those rookies are available. Top pick Cooper Flagg's summer debut jersey sold for $95,520 in August. In 2023, the NBA and Sotheby's announced a multi-year partnership for game-used memorabilia, which allowed product to go directly from the locker room to the high-end auction house for the first time. This season, Sotheby's has broken out its NBA auctions into two groups: a weekly auction and a more premium auction that focuses on the best of the best. That premiere auc",

Grew up with the retro X-men cartoon in real time and loved when the movies came out (yes, many people do not like them, but I think I’m such an X-men fan I just watched them with rose colored glasses) I have issues 1-60 of the 90s books and am working on collecting all of them. I promised myself I wouldn’t even try to start collecting the original X-men comics. They are just too expensive and I don’t have that kind of disposable income..... then I joined whatnot. 😕 Over the last several months I have been picking books up because seeing issues in the low 30s ticking away at 2-5$ is just something I wasn’t able to pass up. I now have a weird thing I have noticed about my comic book collecting. If it is a new book, I want it as pristine as possible. If it is an older book, I want the loved version. That #30 is rough. But I think for some reason, it is my favorite of all the lot. I am fully in the low grade is better than no grade camp, but now I just want everyone’s trash copies of early X-men books. Anybody else weird like that ?",

Got lucky with my first 1:1 with this Mookie Betts from the Topps Series 1 2026. I am chasing Ohtani or Yamamoto signed, so I just put this up on eBay. I know it’s better to buy singles but my ripping addiction won’t let me haha. Question, my friend told me that Fanatics is the new place to put good cards up and I should have taken that route. Is that true? I didn’t know they offered a marketplace etc. Basically he said for any cards worth under 1K put it in eBay and anything over use Fanatics. Or for super exclusive ones, use Goldin.",

          "text": "Enough of these ‘card price’ BS updates and how about a scalper performance update? Headline: Do not buy Booster boxes, and overpriced cards. Do not fall for these new financial posts from scalpers. What the data suggests right now (Feb 2026) (I will highlight in bold interesting points) \\- Sales have not stopped, but they look “thin” on the top chase cards. For example, on PriceCharting (which states it updates prices based on listings that sold on eBay and other marketplaces), some **Fusion World chase cards show \\\\\\~1–2 sales per week volume.** \\- **There’s clear evidence of price inflation vs reality on certain listings.** On one chase card page, PriceCharting shows a big gap between an “eBay price” and a “TCGplayer price” (and then lists recent individual sales). That kind of spread is exactly what you see when listings get pushed up aggressively but the market clears at more varied levels. ￼ \\- Recent sold comps look volatile (**not a smooth upward trend.** For another chase card, the recent eBay sold entries shown include multiple sales in a short window at very different prices (example range shown roughly around the low hundreds up to the high hundreds depending on the specific sale). That pattern usually means the market is being set by scarcity + **speculation rather than steady collector demand.** \\- **Cardmarket “price trend” signals can show sharp cool-offs after spikes.** One Cardmarket listing snippet shows “From” pricing far above the “Price Trend” number (example: “From: 499,99 €” while “Price Trend: 109,90 €”), which is a classic “asking got silly, trend reverted” shape. ￼ So... are DBS prices slowing down, and was it scalpers? Best read based on what I can see: For the hype items (chase alts, markers/promos, manga-type product), it looks like scalpers/speculators definitely played a role in pushing ask prices up quickly, and the **market is now more selective, with patchy volume and wide spreads between listings and sold comps.**",

          "text": "Price Discrepancies for TCGPLAYER vs. eBay I sell cards frequently across eBay, reddit, and facebook marketplace. I recently sold the Gold Mega Charizard Ex 130 from Phantasmal Flames on facebook for $515. I crossposted it on reddit as well, and was downvoted to oblivion by salty users, saying tcgplayer market was $348 and that my item was overpriced, despite selling for ask within 15 minutes of listing and had multiple ready buyers at $515. This post is a disclaimer for buyers and sellers to explore more than one way to comp their items as I've often found tcgplayer's algorithm for determining market price is often laggard to the accurate market sales. It's very often that I'm \"lowballed\" by those choosing to go based off tcgplayer as reason to price their items and I want those to avoid using that as the golden standard for pricing. Most LCS use tcgplayer pricing as well. **Card (NM copies)** |**tcgplayer** |**AVG of last 6 sold** |**pricecharting (eBay)** |**AVG of last 6** Mega Charizard X 130 |$350 |$377 ($27 difference) |$450 |$445 ($5 diff) Team Rocket's Mewtwo |$376 |$406 ($30) |$403 |$425 ($22) Umbreon 161 |$840 |$957 ($117) |$999 |$1073 ($74) Giratina V 186 |$658 |$598 ($60) |$570 |$559 ($11) Dragonite V 192 |$394 |$371 ($23) |$358 |$350 ($8) Mega Charizard X 125 |$637 |$712 ($75) |$784 |$886 ($102) As you can tell, the difference between market price and last 6 sold for tcgplayer is much greater than ebay. This data was not cherry picked, i just chose popular modern chase cards off the top of my head. I included the Mega Charizard SIR to show that \"market\" on tcg is $637 but there's sales today on eBay at $1000 raw. Often only one sale every few days, compared to eBay's multiple daily I would personally choose to comp based on eBay as there's more sales volume as well as actual images. The centering of a modern card is heavily weighted into the card's price and this is taken out of the equation for tcgplayer, thus leading to lower sales prices. Vintage be",

          "text": "what are the opinions on whatnot sellers? I ask for 2 reasons: the first being I had a guy come up to my table at my last show and wanted a pretty sizeable stack of cards. The overall total of the stack was $2,300, and I told him I'd do $2100 for a bulk deal. He grimaced and told me we were so close, and then asked if I could do $1500. \"That's my absolute best, I'm low key taking some stuff off your hands and I gotta carry em rest of the show, catalog and get new top loaders so I'm factoring labor into this.\" I wasn't overly offended, but I told him $2000 was the lowest. He got so mad and basically stormed off and the vendor behind me told that wasn't unusual for that guy and that he's got a name in our community for being a really opportunistic and derogatory whatnot streamer. is whatnot like that all the time? I've never really been on and never spent money on it, but have had a few people tell me \"oh yeah I'm a whatnot streamer, you might've heard of the stream.\" second reason is: is selling on whatnot worth it? I can't imagine it is if your asking for that kinda discount....?",

          "text": "One of the most popular complaints I see in the Hobby involves folks saying some form of “breakers get all the products”. Then, a hobby simp or Fanatics burner account will always chime in with “Fanatics has a public presale where you can always buy boxes at MSRP!” Is that \\*technically\\* true? Yes. However, my main question is what’s the actual allotment put aside for the public? My theory is that Fanatics releases an EXTREMELY small number of boxes for the general public. I’m talking less than 5% of the total available inventory. It’s the one and only way you can explain how EVERY SINGLE RELEASE “sells out” within 90 seconds. Fanatics wants you to believe it’s because millions and millions of people are flooding Topps.com or Fanatics.com and buying tens of thousands of cases. I think it’s because they release an extremely small amount of actual cases in a public release. That way they can pretend “everyone” has a fair shot at regular pricing, before the aftermarket monster takes hold and suddenly you’re paying 50% to 125% more for the same box. Then, after they offer all their preferred breakers a case or two at MSRP... they come back a week later and say “you’re entitled to another two cases, but now they are \\*market price\\*. Which means even breakers are now paying a 50% to 125% markup, which much like tariffs, those costs are passed on to who? You nailed it. The consumer. 2025 Topps Cosmic Chrome is a perfect example. Fanatics had a “presale” at $335 a box I believe. Now? They are $625-$700 on all resale sites. I don’t even care that Fanatics is shady as fuck with their pricing. They’re a business. They can do whatever they want. What I wish happened, was that much like the lottery or casinos... they had to be 100% transparent about everything. That way if they are only offering ten cases to the public, and then 10,000 cases to breakers... at least we know. And at that point can make a much better decision on what, if anything, we want to buy. And make no mist",

At first, I didnt know what to make of all the drama, the trolls, the lore.. I now am a loyal member of the kingdom and if you this post 10minutes you may be too. Before he was known as **King Jonas**, he was simply **Jcardcollector96**, a 29-year-old from Beverly Hills, CA who entered the sports card hobby in 2018 with passion, money, warmth, and an unguarded heart. His rise on Whatnot Sports intertwined with a woman many in the hobby came to know as Gianna — **\"HobbyPrincess\"**. They were not merely collaborators on stream; they were lovers, partners beyond the screen—an unlikely pair who shared late calls, Las Vegas vacations, grand dreams, and a spark that collectors still whisper about. Their bond was intense and lasted 3 months, but when it fractured, the hobby itself took notice. In the aftermath of their break-up, rumors swelled like storm clouds. Across Whatnot, Reddit, Instagram, Medium, TikTok and Facebook, strangers spun tales—some dramatic, some delusional, many untrue. Narratives were twisted, intentions distorted and lies took flight faster than facts could walk. Yet Jonas chose not to drown in that noise. He chose creation. He chose rebirth. He chose the Kingdom... To stumble upon **King Jonas’** hall on Whatnot is not a mere scroll-by—it is to cross the threshold into a Kingdom reborn.

We didn't have special storage cases for those slabs, just binders or those trusty shoe boxes for our cards. There wasn't Ebay or other apps to look for comps, there was Beckett or Baseball Card magazine. Wax Boxes were just boxes...not blasters, blisters, or hobby boxes. There were no parallels, short prints, 1/1....just All Star Cards or team cards. A rookie or all star had maybe five cards each year from each brand, not 100 different cards or variations. Set building was a thing back then. There were no influencers or breakers, just the local card shop or the neighbor kid down the street. Card shows were at the mall or your local sporting goods store and players used to sign there for free. Collecting was simple back then. Now the hobby seems like it gambling and the \"House\" (Fanatics) only wins.",

As I'm sure you know, recently \"investors\" from pokemon have made their way into the community en masse, buying up every card they think people will want and then jacking the prices as high as they can. Now correct me if I'm wrong or happen to be in the minority here, but I think that's lame as hell. I want to make something extremely clear, one piece is a game for the players. WE have the power to keep one piece from becoming a money laundering scheme. Starting from here on, don't buy any alt art, promo or otherwise, for any price higher than what TCGPLAYER says the card was worth on November 20th 2025. Or really any other card that you can tell has obviously been bought out and gouged like op01 luffy base leader. Just buy the cards you need for your decks. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell that weird dude at your locals that no one likes, this has to be a community effort. Scalping is a risky game, something people should've learned when they spent their life savings on Journey Together packs just to find out no one wanted them and especially not for 3x msrp. They will be forced to lower the prices back down if they want to make any sort of money back, as long as we don't buy from these crypto losers, prices *will* go back down. It's economics 101.",

Obviously there's eBay, 130pt, fanatics & more, & I also use Sports Cards Pro, but none seem to be able to cite every card printed of any specific player. Is this simply/often down to none being in circulation? Or should/do better, more comprehensive lists exist? Now, maybe I'm bad at searching properly or am overlooking something/where but for the life of me I can't find what I'm after. Does it exist or is it a case of aggregating all info from various places? For my sins I kinda pc Mac Jones and just pick up cards when I fancy it (not too difficult) but my daughter has gone from K-pop to card collecting in the past year & having latched onto the Seattle Storm a few years ago, is now after as many Dominique Malonga cards as WE (I'm funding it) can get (there are TONS). I'm not against it, she's both a good 'prospect' *&* prospect & isn't too expensive atm. She's got spreadsheets & notes everywhere, is in & out of eBay buying, bidding & watching & has got close to 40 cards so far. There are a LOT more (& more coming with Prizm...) out there but not everywhere lists them, even Beckett doesn't have some cards on their various checklists. This is largely the reason for the question tbh.",

This also lets me re-evaluate updated hobby &amp; jumbo pricing and compare how they stack up against retail. My hunch: this release is going to hold some steam, even with the cost-prohibitive Chrome NBA right around the corner. This post is strictly about value. For total production and print-run data, please refer back to my original breakdown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseballcards/comments/1nzvw3y/202526_topps_basketball_breakdown_and_deep_dive/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). **Hit Frequencies:** Most formats remain unchanged from the original post, but here are the two formats with newly confirmed info: Costco Super Box • 1 auto per 6.48 boxes • 15.14 parallels/box • 12.02 inserts/box • 1 # card per 1.42 boxes • 3.45 boxes per relic Black Friday Target Value Box • 1 auto per 19.44 boxes • 9.27 parallels/box • 10.26 inserts/box • 1 # card per 1.72 boxes • 1 relic per 8.07 boxes **Value Landscape:** Assumes current Blowout prices of $225/hobby, $440/jumbo, and MSRP on all retail SKUs. Black Friday Value Boxes are now confirmed at $35, and Costco Super Boxes at $45 online (some buyers have shown pricing of $40 in their local store, but my calculations will assume the $45 MSRP). **Best $ per card** 1) Fat pack — 19 cents 2) Costco Super Box — 21 cents 3) Hanger boxes &amp; Mega boxes — 22 cents **Worst $ per card** 10) Jumbo- $1.04 9) Hobby- 85 cents 8) Value Box- 30 cents **Best $ per parallel** 1) Fanatics Value Box — $2.47 2) Costco Super Box — $2.97 3) Value Box — $5.83 4) Black Friday Target Value Box — $5.93 **Worst $ per parallel** 10) Hobby — $37.27 9) Jumbo — $27.59 8) Fat Pack — $13.21 **Best $ per auto** 1) Costco Super Box — $291.60 2) Hobby — $394.23 3) Jumbo — $419.19 (This is one of the rare times ho",

My biggest question is are we going to keep getting Topps brand basketball cards or is Fanatics going to release their own line? Is Panini still going to release all its same lines season, but unlicensed? And what happens to all the premium/unique lines like immaculate, national treasures, court kings, black, etc. Panini had so many lines that took them so many years to build, do you guys think we’re just going to have one or two tops basketball lines for the next few seasons? And then what happens to all the penny cards that exist with a licensing? Will they eventually lose any value? So many questions! Thanks!",

I prefer the cleaner look of the base cards, where you can see the field, fans, stadiums, etc VS parallels editions that block or blur out with gimmicky graphics. I had all my cards from the 80/90s stolen but recently started to get interested in collecting a handful of my favorite players. I'm not a fan of the company Fanatics and them buying Topps turned me off from buying packs. Instead of directly giving Fanatics money I'm buying individual cards on ebay.

Then in my hunts I started to find rarer pieces, and items that had more of an artistic purpose rather than a utilitarian purpose. So out went the tableware and in went the artistic glass. I've been selling a lot of my uranium glass on ebay and Whatnot. I really enjoy selling it on Whatnot because it gives me the ability to chat with the people purchasing my items (both UV reactive and regular items). So now I've turned it into a legitimate small business. I'd like to invite you all to join me tonight at 6pm Central for my second Whatnot glow show, which I've appropriately named OnlyGlows. There's lots of uranium and cadmium, with some manganese thrown in for good measure. Tonight's show will have many rare and hard to find pieces. Hope to see you there! https://whatnot.com/s/MlVguh5v",

          "text": "eBay seller sent wrong card, not sure what to do So I recently won an eBay auction for the card in the first photo (Green Ice). This photo is the exact card that was shown in the eBay listing. Package arrived today and inside is not the same card from the listing, instead it's the card in the second photo (Green). I checked recent comp sales, both cards are valued similarly with the card I was sent (Green) having sold for slightly more. Based on this I guess the mistake isn't a huge one although I'm no expert on all the parallels by any means. Not sure what I should do here. Should I just keep the card sent or contact the seller and let them know they sent the wrong card. What would you?",

Got lucky with my first 1:1 with this Mookie Betts from the Topps Series 1 2026. I am chasing Ohtani or Yamamoto signed, so I just put this up on eBay. I know it’s better to buy singles but my ripping addiction won’t let me haha. Question, my friend told me that Fanatics is the new place to put good cards up and I should have taken that route. Is that true? I didn’t know they offered a marketplace etc. Basically he said for any cards worth under 1K put it in eBay and anything over use Fanatics. Or for super exclusive ones, use Goldin.",

And it's a long weekend for some of us. I don't have to go to work tomorrow. It's President's Day, so we're off. So, really no restriction on how long I can go tonight. Usually on a Sunday night, I'll probably wrap up shop around 11:00 or so, but we can go as long as you guys want to. So, thank you very much for joining us. We got a Walmart video that is currently being uploaded. I think it is uploaded, but it's not um processed up to 4K yet. Probably another hour for that to happen. So, if you are wondering where tonight's YouTube video is, I was waiting on it, but looks like it's going to take a little bit longer, but uh no problem there. We'll get it upload here around 7:00 or so. So, thanks for joining us. We're going to start off with some museum collection tonight. I see Knucks just grabbed some spots in this round, which is almost sold out. It also comes with series 1, 2026 Topps series 1, a hobby box of that. We got that case sitting over here. We've hopefully we can continue to find some good stuff out of the brand new release. And it also comes with a Bowman Draft Mega Box along with the jersey. So, all of our pick your team rounds pretty much all come with jerseys. I think they all do. So, we have plenty of those to give away tonight. We also have free packs of cards we'll be giving away left and right. We'll start one of those up here in a second. And I just had to go grab my bow and draft megas. It's a little bit of a labyrinth to get over to the other side of this office, even though it's a kind of a small office. Got to like weave around. Chris just picked up a spot. Padres's in black and white. Thank you very much. All right. Well, here's a free pack of cards. Wh Never mind. I didn't load all the free packs of cards in.

Alex shares her journey from traditional sports journalism to the heart of the hobby, why most collectors underestimate volatility, and how a single Bo Nix card sale perfectly captures the risk-reward reality of modern collecting.

Whether you collect for fun, invest for value, or just want a smarter framework, this episode delivers perspective without the hype.

          "text": "Sports Cards Aren’t a Hobby Anymore... They’re an Industry The sports card world is evolving — and the changes go far beyond marketplaces. In this episode of Collector Nation, Ryan Alford and Brian Ludd explore why building a successful card marketplace is so difficult, why even major companies struggle to gain traction, and how collector behavior is shifting as the industry matures. They discuss trust, scale, and experience, the growing importance of singles, allocation dynamics that keep leaders on top, and why digital tools, retail environments, and community are becoming central to the future of collecting. This conversation reframes sports cards not as a hobby, but as a full-scale industry — and explains what that shift means for collectors, shops, platforms, and anyone building in the space. Topics Covered • Why Walmart & Fanatics struggle with marketplaces • The three things every marketplace needs to survive • Why most new platforms fail early • Why singles are changing collector behavior • What “industry” really means for sports cards • Allocation freezes and power consolidation • Why experience beats transactions Why This Episode Matters The sports card world is being reshaped quietly — not by hype, but by behavior.

To kick off 2026, Ryan Alford is joined by his son Hudson for an honest conversation about where the sports card hobby is today — and where it’s headed next. From ripping Donruss Football blasters to debating game-worn patches, breaking culture, and affordability, this episode explores the growing gap between adult collectors and the next generation. The sports card hobby is evolving fast — but are adults and kids even playing the same game anymore?

The ticket even sold for twice as much as Paul Skenes' debut ticket Morandini played for the Phillies from 1990-1997 and later managed the team (Credit: Getty) By Darren Rovell — February 18, 2026 Share When Mickey Morandini pulled it off, it came so quickly, even the announcers didn’t realize what happened. And who could blame them? An unassisted triple play had only happened eight times in Major League Baseball history. Why are we talking about Morandini’s magical moment? Because, on Tuesday, a ticket to the Sept. 20, 1992 game featuring Morandini’s Philadelphia Phillies against Barry Bonds’ Pittsburgh Pirates — sold for a whopping $1,540. To put that in perspective of Pirates tickets, the most recent sale of Bill Mazeroski’s Game 7 World Series walk-off was $945. Paul Skenes' rookie debut ticket last sold for $708. But unlike those two, PSA had never graded an exemplar from this game. At the time, Morandini, who caught a fly ball from Jeff King, doubled off a runner who left second and tagged Bonds on his way to second, was also ticked about not thinking about the memorabilia. Video shows Morandini, who batted .268 in 11 years in the majors, flipping the ball up in the air as he runs by the mound. “That was stupid on my part,” he told reporters after the game. “It was probably hit as a foul ball to some fan.” Darren Rovell is the founder of cllct and one of the country's leading reporters on the collectibles market. He previously worked for ESPN, CNBC and The Action Network.",

Really sorry if this is a stupid question, the only other card I have posted about was a (clearly) fake 1st Ed Charizard that I was buying on the off chance it wasn't fake so clearly my knowledge on subject this is poor.",

          "text": "Buyer claims \"Not Received\" despite \"Delivered\" status & paying fees. Am I safe? Hi everyone, I’m looking for advice on a situation with a buyer in Switzerland (I am in Germany). I sold a Funko Pop (around €80) and shipped it via UPS. Since it was an international sale to a non-EU country, customs fees were applied. The timeline: Feb 13: UPS tracking shows \"Import C.O.D. charges have been paid or billed.\" Feb 13: The buyer messaged me privately, very angry about the UPS fees, stating: \"I’ve never had to pay ever import fees for a shipment that is under 150 let alone this one that is 80 I’ve ordered million times from same carrier and Germany never paid that fee.” “I have now paid it however very unhappy with it I would like my money back.\" Feb 16: Tracking officially shows \"DELIVERED\" in Zurich. Feb 17 (Today): The buyer opened an \"Item Not Received\" request, claiming: \"Marked as arrived didn't come... I not got anything.\" The contradiction: In the eBay case, the buyer is claiming they never received the item. However, they explicitly messaged me on Feb 13th confirming they paid the customs fees. Since you usually only pay these fees to UPS upon or for delivery, this proves they were in contact with the courier regarding this package. I've already uploaded the tracking and sent a message in the case pointing out their earlier admission. My questions: Since tracking says \"Delivered,\" am I 100% safe under eBay’s seller protection? Does the fact that they admitted to paying fees on the 13th (matching the tracking) help prove they are lying? Should I just wait until Feb 20th to \"Ask eBay to step in\"? The buyer is being aggressive and said they \"will no longer reply.\" Any advice?",

Apparently the agent looked over this sale and his history and decided she was going to put in for his account to be suspended, so self-fulfilling prophecy I guess.

          "text": "Best Sports Card Scanner App I've Found – Baseball Card Values, PSA Grading Estimates & More Been lurking on this sub for a while and always see people asking how to value their collections. Last month I inherited a shoebox full of my dad's old baseball cards from the 80s and 90s – we're talking hundreds of cards with no idea what's junk and what's gold. I spent hours manually searching eBay sold listings before giving up. Tried a couple apps but the recognition was hit or miss. Then a buddy at my LCS mentioned SnapCard and honestly it's been a game changer for organizing everything. **What I actually like about it:** * **The sports card scanner is stupid fast** – just snap a photo of any baseball card, basketball card, or football card and it identifies it almost instantly. Saved me so much time going through that shoebox. * **Real-time price guide pulls from actual sold data** – not just random asking prices. It aggregates from eBay, Goldin, Heritage Auctions, and PWCC so you're seeing what cards actually sell for. * **The PSA grading estimates are surprisingly accurate** – I was skeptical about the AI grading analysis, but I sent in 5 cards to PSA and the app predicted 4 of them exactly right (missed one by half a grade). Also does Beckett grading and SGC grading estimates if that's your preference. * **Collection manager actually works** – I can finally track my card collection value over time instead of random spreadsheets. **Cards it supports:** Works with pretty much everything I've thrown at it – baseball cards, basketball cards, football cards, hockey cards, even my kid's Pokemon cards and some MTG cards I had lying around. Basically covers sports cards and trading card games. **Not perfect though:** * Vintage cards pre-1970 can be spotty on recognition * Wish there was a web version for bulk scanning * Some of the market trends data could be more detailed **Who it's good for:** If you're a casual collector with a pile of cards you need to sort through, or ",

Like what?? The stamp is the reason it cost what it cost. It's part of the card. Genuinely shocked at the stupidity of that response. Had they just been like my bad here's a refund or do you want a partial refund I would have been fine and still left them a good review. But this is just ridiculous. I also looked at their negative reviews afterwards and they've done this multiple times. Is this a legit concern or am I the asshole?",

          "text": "2025 Topps Cosmic Chrome Analysis & Print Runs Topps decided to keep the surprises coming today, quietly releasing the odds for 2025 Cosmic Chrome. This product has built a strong following over the years, and it would be great to see it get the attention it deserves. Unfortunately, these odds will almost certainly be overshadowed by the upcoming major Chrome releases- but there’s still plenty here worth breaking down. **Initial Observations: The Lunar Box Problem** As much as I’d like to offer a complete and definitive analysis, Topps left out a few critical details that prevent that for now. Cosmic Chrome has historically been a hobby-only product, but this year introduces a second SKU: Lunar Boxes. The issue? We have no confirmed information on the core box dynamics- price, cards per pack, packs per box, or case configuration. We do have odds, and what’s clear is that Lunar Boxes were produced in very small quantities. Based solely on the odds, nothing appears exclusive to Lunar Boxes that isn’t also in Hobby. However, Checklist Insider notes exclusive Lunar Eclipse parallels, but these do not appear anywhere on Topps’ own odds sheet. Lunar Boxes contain zero autos, and they also exclude a handful of rare insert superfractors and red refractors found in Hobby. At the same time, several rare inserts and parallels have better odds in Lunar Boxes than in Hobby, which is unusual given the lack of autos. For now, Lunars remain a conundrum: likely a lower-cost or “Hobby Lite” configuration of some kind, but impossible to evaluate properly without basic product info. Once those details are available, I’ll compare value metrics between formats. For now, the analysis below focuses strictly on Hobby. **EDIT: Some new information has come to light regarding Lunar Boxes.** **Just like 2024, Topps slipped ultra-elusive Lunar Boxes into Cosmic Chrome. Last year we had 100. For 2025, we get 147 of them, with each pack containing a Lunar Eclipse /10 parallel.** **It threw me for",

I had some extra 925 nib chains, so I tossed one in as a free gift. Cause it's a pendant and a chain would be nice if they needed one, right? The item passed authentication but failed because it didn't match photos. Because of the free chain I added. This was verified by CS. The buyer didn't even have the choice to accept or reject, it was just automatically sent back. Maybe I'm just stupid or naive, idk. But now I've lost money and a sale in a very slow moving market.",

It's frustrating because now I am missing 160 random cards from the decks I ordered and now I have to try to figure out which cards, which decks, and then reorder them. Ridiculous.

I want to preface this by saying im originally from crypto and over the last few months ive been rolling some profits into TCGs, but more specifically one piece, my strategy has been thus far half sealed product and half grails, now that i have probably finished accumulating, im going to share some rambling thoughts that i have. regarding sealed product ive been dabbling in only the strongest sets, romance dawn, blue and white bottom for obvious reasons being the first set, op05, op09 and prb01, bought a few cases of op11 aswell because its cheap and also has very good cards although i think this ones a slow cook because of how new it is AND bandai have definitely started printing more product then the earlier sets. Since prb02 dropped in japan and we found out there's probably no manga god packs, i even bought more prb01 as i feel it seems pretty obvious to me that lack of manga god packs will make prb01 even more highly sought after. regarding the grails, ive taken the same approach, mostly buying up the high value cards, being op01 manga shanks and some pre errata alt leaders, again first manga ever, card itself is not the best but it has provenance and that is important imo, gear 5 luffy from op05 but also the prb01 version, the oda sig luffy also from op05, this one has insane low available supply online despite a decent population count and very hard to get in english, tcg player prices for oda sig luffy are totally wrong simply because no one is actually selling them so old pricing cant be updated yet, ppl arent stupid and are obviously holding on to this card (everything im talking about is obviously english only, and i only buy graded (i dont dabble in jpy product, too much supply) regarding reprint mangas, for the most part i dont buy them, i stick with originals, however i do make an exception for g5 luffy prb01 reprint because its just such a good/popular card. Now we get to the card i think is the MOST mispriced, gold gol.d.rog",

I know ebay only wants numbers in this field and no symbols ($ for example) but in the example they provided, they were using a period for cents so I don't know why this isn't working.

The seller has now taken $100 off my return because \"it's been used\" I bought a full-size bottle of perfume from an Ebay seller a few weeks ago. Looking back, this was a dumb decision. The seller had about 30,000 sales and a 5 star average review. Still, I should have looked into this more. This was my own dumb mistake that I won't be making again, however... As soon as I received the item I got a bad feeling it was a fake. There was a sticker on the plastic wrap of the box saying it was made in China. When I took off the wrapping, the box was a bit dented and scuffed. The inside of the box was discolored as well. The bottle of perfume was slightly scratched and the cap to the bottle was scuffed up. I gave the seller the benefit of the doubt, though. Maybe this bottle had fallen off some truck and still could be authentic. However, I have a sample of this perfume already and I sprayed this bottle all of 1 time and it smelled nothing like the sample I have. I know this is a fake. It was sold as a new, sealed box authentic item. I immediately requested a refund, which was immediately accepted. The next day I dropped the package off at the post office with all of the materials I received included in the package (plastic wrap, sticker, bubble wrap, etc.) I just received an email saying the seller is only giving me half of my refund ($90 out of a $180 purchase) because \"it wasn't returned in the original condition\" and \"the item was opened used by the buyer\". This seems a little harsh to me considering a) this is a counterfeit item that I could not have known was counterfeit until I opened the box and sprayed the perfume, and b) the only difference between the condition I received it in and the condition I sent it back in was some opened plastic wrap and 1 spray out of a 75mL bottle of fake perfume. I'm wondering if I have any recourse for this. I know I can \"ask Ebay to step in\" by basically su",

          "text": "Been lurking on this sub for a while and always see people asking how to value their collections. Last month I inherited a shoebox full of my dad's old baseball cards from the 80s and 90s – we're talking hundreds of cards with no idea what's junk and what's gold. I spent hours manually searching eBay sold listings before giving up. Tried a couple apps but the recognition was hit or miss. Then a buddy at my LCS mentioned SnapCard and honestly it's been a game changer for organizing everything. **What I actually like about it:** * **The sports card scanner is stupid fast** – just snap a photo of any baseball card, basketball card, or football card and it identifies it almost instantly. Saved me so much time going through that shoebox. * **Real-time price guide pulls from actual sold data** – not just random asking prices. It aggregates from eBay, Goldin, Heritage Auctions, and PWCC so you're seeing what cards actually sell for. * **The PSA grading estimates are surprisingly accurate** – I was skeptical about the AI grading analysis, but I sent in 5 cards to PSA and the app predicted 4 of them exactly right (missed one by half a grade). Also does Beckett grading and SGC grading estimates if that's your preference. * **Collection manager actually works** – I can finally track my card collection value over time instead of random spreadsheets. **Cards it supports:** Works with pretty much everything I've thrown at it – baseball cards, basketball cards, football cards, hockey cards, even my kid's Pokemon cards and some MTG cards I had lying around. Basically covers sports cards and trading card games. **Not perfect though:** * Vintage cards pre-1970 can be spotty on recognition * Wish there was a web version for bulk scanning * Some of the market trends data could be more detailed **Who it's good for:** If you're a casual collector with a pile of cards you need to sort through, or you want to know if something's worth submitting for grading before paying $30+ per card, it'",

In 1997, Skybox printed one of the most iconic parallels of all-time, Metal Universe Precious Metal Gems, which have become the most treasured '90s football and basketball cards. Little do people know, Metal Universe was first produced for the hockey card market in 1996. But the dynamic Precious Metal Gems parallel was not included with the set, costing several hockey legends their chance at a PMG. However, starting in 2012, hockey fans finally had a chance to obtain these precious grails, with the Metal Universe brand returning as an insert in a handful of Fleer brands released by Upper Deck. The hockey version did not follow the standard parallel structure of the football and basketball releases. Instead, it came in the form of a 30-card checklist with four versions: Red /150, Blue /50, Green /10, and Purple /5. Since the initial release, they have continued to produce these hockey cards, with stars such as McDavid receiving a rookie card PMG. A Green version is live in Alt Auctions, ending Thursday, December 11th.",

That same store does Facebook auctions and I have gotten a few good items on there to make a decent flip. I would like to know something more consistent. Whats everyone’s go to? Liquidation pallets? Return pallets? Wholesale? I have plenty of room for storage. Where are these guys on selling platforms getting all the name brand Jordans, coach bags, etc for such a good deal that the are comfortable selling them on 5 second sudden death auctions? I don’t mind getting a business license if that would give me more access to buy wholesale. I just have no clue where to start.

Flash forward to today, I had a sale for an older non volatile FCA card. I searched through all my boxes and can’t remember ever pulling that specific card. I refunded and sent a message but he did not respond and is now leaving a bad review. Am I in the right to try and fight for my 100% rating or just move on since it was my responsibility to make sure I didn’t accidentally list the wrong card.

Boy it took a lot of money to figure out you can just buy these things. It’s funny because people keep calling it a “hobby”. Only rich people can play this game when every box is 70-100, whole whatnot thing feels like a scam to someone who collected cards as a kid and am now in my late 30s but it’s addictive as hell. I wish I can say ripping wax was better but the return felt even worse with the exception of a single winter Phoenix blaster where I pulled like 300 bucks worth of cards, wish I bought more of those.

If so, what was the process like in terms of insurance and receiving itemized receipts and/or confirmation of your drop-off? And how long did it take to appear in the system? I'm trying to sell a portion of my collection and I'm a bit adverse to shipping them to PSA in case it gets lost en route. I originally thought going to drop-off events near me would be safer, but looking online seems to give me mixed reviews. Sorry if this question has been asked before, but I've only been able to find similar threads talking about drop-off processes and timelines for grading submissions. Thank you!",

I hit the Dallas Mavericks in an auction and hit some valuable Cooper Flagg rookie cards, one was a yellow foil numbered to /275 that is worth at least $800 raw, if graded even more. I also hit a ball of duty Cooper Flag Rookie wave holo that is worth at least $100 raw. After the break the seller cancelled my order saying he lost them smh. I reached out to whatnott and the seller and still I haven’t got any type of refund or compensation for the cards. I sent a bunch of emails to whatnot support and they still say they are investigating. I sent them all the evidence they asked for and it’s going on 5 days already and still nothing. Now my money and cards that I hit are in limbo. Everyone please be careful on whatnot and always look at the sellers reviews before buying from them. This seller kept the best team which is the Dallas Mavericks which was supposed to be mine but he canceled my orders for himself to keep my valuable Cooper Flag Rookies and he charged everyone else for the rest of the 29 nba teams. The seller made out on my Copper Flag rookie cards and made the people pay for the rest of the teams in the break.

I said sure that’s fine and they ended up returning it and I refunded them their money. After they returned it back to me, i was initially suspicious because the damage was different to the one they showed me but I didn’t think much of it. I decided to just open the upc because I can’t sell it anymore but when I opened it, there was no promos and all the packs had been cut out on the bottom, making me think that the buyer took all the promos and opened all of the packs as well. I already sent a report on eBay that the buyer sent back a damaged item, but what more can I do? And can’t the buyer just say that it was me who opened the packs and took the promos?

          "text": "Never sell luxury items on eBay I’ve been selling on eBay for years, and for the most part, my experience has been fine. I’ve sold tons of low-priced items with little to no issue. But recently, when trying to sell a few luxury pieces, I had this feeling eBay never protect their sellers. I sold a Louis Vuitton bucket hat ealier this year. Without any communication at all, the buyer directly filed a dispute through their bank, not even through eBay, not even talked to me. There was no message, no reason, no return, just a chargeback. eBay said they would “fight for my rights as a seller, and talked to the bank” but after 3 months of waiting, 3 MONTH! I lost both the money and the item. No explanation, no follow-up, nothing. There’s absolutely no real seller protection when the buyer goes through their bank instead of eBay. The second time, I sold a Balenciaga hat (with the original receipt from the store). The buyer insisted it was fake because it didn’t look identical to another Balenciaga product he owned, which is absurd, since even within the same brand, manufacturing differences are normal. I accepted the return request just to resolve it peacefully. But then the buyer left me a huge negative review, all caps shouting “FAKE” in his review, extremely rude and completely baseless. EBay refused to remove this feedback, even though I had proof of authenticity and accepted the return. And of course, sellers aren’t allowed to leave any kind of negative review for buyers, so we just have to take it. I’ve learned my lesson. EBay is not a safe place to sell luxury items. There’s zero protection for sellers dealing with high-value goods. Buyers can make false claims, file chargebacks, and eBay will just shrug and say “we tried.” If you ever plan to sell anything designer or pricey, don’t use eBay. It’s not worth the stress or the loss.",

I shipped out maybe a month ago $250 worth of Pokemon cards to a buyer (who has very high ratings, trusted buyer) and they reached out about not receiving their package. So I did everything I could in my power to contact USPS and also contact EBAY. We all know how impossible both of these can be to work with as EBay is unresponsive and won’t even let you talk to them and USPS’ website is ancient doesn’t work half the time and I don’t think they will help me if the package officially says ‘delivered’ in their system. So even with insurance on the package, I don’t think I can get my money back from USPS. If I’m wrong about that point me in the right direction. I told the buyer to mark the item as ‘not received’ because EBay would not let me contact them or make any changes until a case was made. Which gave me 3 days to update tracking/talk to my buyer, which I did. The tracking on USPS’ official site says delivered and shows all of the tracking updates. eBay did not show all the tracking updates and just says ‘out to delivery to authenticator’. I don’t even know what an authenticator is or is needed for considering the cards are graded, and I’ve sold a 1k card and did not have this stupid process go on. Me and my buyer are extremely confused and feel like eBay just snapped up our extremely expensive purchase and is preventing us from working with them. I don’t know if somehow USPS is wrong when I feel their tracking is usually reliable, so I’m favored to believe EBay is messing something up on their end. They emailed me today that they sided with the buyer (clearly didn’t read anything about our case) and issued a full refund. Now I’m screwed out of my childhood cards and the cash I really needed. What the hell do I do. Update 1: Now I’ve received an over $40 charge to my bank account because that’s how much eBay decided to overcharge my b",

He got into it cause of arena and the collabs, while I got into it because I love Final Fantasy, especially FF7. So because of my love for FF and FF7, I naturally want to collect all the FF7 cards. So I went onto tcgplayer and looked at the Sephiroth cards. I saw the full art Fabled Soldier and instantly fell in love with the look of the card but the price threw me off. $70 for a card seems so insane to me that I threw away the idea right away. So fast track to today, I go to a card shop to just go look around and maybe get a commander set or a few singles and that’s when I saw the full art foil borderless Sephiroth Fabled Soldier. I asked how much it was and ofc it was $75. I said that’s a bit much for me and went home. When I got home I was talking to my mom about it and how I don’t understand why cards are so expensive. Just normal talk yk. Well she went out to get groceries and without me knowing, went to the card shop and asked about it. Well she bought it, she bought the $75 card. I’m very grateful and I was extremely happy but now I feel guilty. I don’t like that she bought it because it bothers me that she spent $75 on a card when that money could’ve been used for something else. I’ve been thinking of returning the card and getting her money back because even though I love the card, I can’t even touch it without feeling wrong. Ik it’s just a card and in all reality it’s not that deep but I bothers me so much that I would much rather shred the card than keep it at this point. What do you guys think? Do you think I’m overthinking and overreacting? TLDR: Mom buys $75 card and I want to return it because spending that much on a card makes me feel terrible and the fact I didn’t buy it using my own money is eating at me.

Part 1: Going in hard, and getting in way way to deep. 5 years ago it was the summer of 2020 and I was on vacation sitting in a pool somewhere in Georgia and youtube fed me a video. I had returned to MTG in 2018 with Dominaria and I was still in full excitement mode seeing some of my old cards from the 90s had appreciated in value. The supply chain FOMO of 2020 and 2021 was just setting in when a video on Youtube got me psyched about building a cardboard empire. The guy was wearing a green visor, standing in front of a wipe board and talking about box prices going to the moon. I had done pretty well in the 90s buying sealed boxes of ice age, alliances and mirage cracking packs and selling singles to pay for the hobby. It seemed like sealed was the way to go. My optimistic and incredibly naïve plan: Buy a case of each set, wait the 5 years for it to double, sell half the case and have a free sealed collection. My goal was to spend about $2K per year on draft plus some extraneous stuff like commander decks and bundles, then after 5 years have about $10,000 invested worth $20,000. At the 2x mark I wanted to start selling to achieve a $10,000 set of sealed products for free. 5 years later did it work? Well sort of... Here are some things that have changed: · Specialty sets that cost 2x-3.5x a normal set (I’m looking at you commander masters) · Regular sets skyrocketing in price 50% from $80 to $130 a box · The pace of sets – No more 3x 1 case per year. · The amount of different product lines – collector, set, draft, play, commander decks etc · Universes beyond Needless to say, the idea of just spreading a little bit of money out and waiting became almost infinitely harder. MTG added set and collector boosters? Unsure of which to buy, I bought a case of each. Double masters came out and VIP boxes were $80-90, with draft at $300. I bought some cases o",

I bought into a break for one of those Galaxy Silver packs, which are clearly labeled as multi-sport. The seller opens the pack live and out comes... a Pokémon card. I was totally thrown off because I’d been watching him rip these same packs for a while and every single one had sports cards. I double-checked the manufacturer’s website just to be sure—and sure enough, those Galaxy Silver packs are 100% sports only. No Pokémon, no TCG, just sports. I reached out to the seller and explained the situation, asking for a refund. This morning, I got the classic “refund rejected” message with zero explanation. Fortunately, I reported the issue to Whatnot directly with all the screenshots and video evidence, and they processed a refund quickly. Moral of the story: stay alert and double-check what you're buying. Just because someone seems legit doesn’t mean they are. I’ll be sticking to eBay from now on. Lol. If you're curious, the seller goes by: otiasports otiarips otiatcg",

Both collections have sat in binders in the corner of my room untouched for a month or so. 2 nights ago I decided to admire my prime collection that I worked hard going through eBay auctions and going to multiple card shops trying to collect every card. Upon opening the binder I noticed the center piece (Meganium Prime) was missing . I panicked wondering if it fell or if it slid behind one of my other cards but it was gone . Decided to look through my other binders I had stacked and of course my ceruledge IR , tapu bulu IR and eevee IR promo we're missing aswell. Checked my wifes binder to see if she had cards missing and of course some of her Raikous that she's been collecting have been taken specifically her amazing rare raikou that started her collection. We were heart broken but then it dawned on us that my 11 year old nephew has been secretly coming down stairs in our living space when we leave to go to work . We caught him once cause he thought we weren't home but my wife was there . After telling his mother the situation what exactly was missing and how much the cards were worth she told me he had admitted to them being taken and that he had a handful of cards at school in his desk that belonged to me. I wish the story ended with him returning from school with all the cards he had stolen from us but unfortunately my sister returned home with a stack of cards found in their desk and not a single one of them belonged to me just a bunch of common and uncommon cards worth about 2 dollars. It hurts to know that these cards I spent my money , pulled with friends and had watched on auctions for days be traded away gone forever. I know I can always get them back but I'm so hurt that it even happened in the first place and just wanted to share what is happening and how I'm feeling with ",

I saw this happen to another guy in my fb card group so please be aware! I sent 5 emails requesting a check, wire transfer, credit card refund for their comp value. “Even though they under comped I never disputed that” and as you can see they closed my case with a whatnot credit.

Then I get this message saying the age old scam “you sent the wrong card, I only received the base version” I obviously sent the card I had listed as it’s the only one I had like that. I have almost 500’sold with a 100% rating. I’m definitely not trying to do a swap a roo on my customers. So they have started a return for wrong item received. I’m guessing I have to accept the return and then when he sends back the “wrong card” I have to appeal to eBay and play the gamble of will they side with me and this obvious scam?

Of the top 10 transactions, more than half involved either Michael Jordan or Kobe Bryant. And, of course, a trio of current Los Angeles stars — LeBron James, Shohei Ohtani and Luka Dončić — also made appearances on the list. Here are the top 10 sports card sales of the year, according to Card Ladder’s records, starting with one for the all-time record books. 1. 2007-08 Upper Deck Exquisite Collection Kobe Bryant-Michael Jordan Dual Logoman Autograph 1/1 PSA 6: $12.932 million The most expensive sports card ever sold at public auction broke the bank earlier this year when a Dual Logoman featuring patches from Jordan and Bryant fetched nearly $13 million . On its own, the card paired one of the hobby’s most iconic sets with game-used Logoman patches from two of basketball’s all-time greatest players. The card’s story got even more interesting when Shark Tank star and celebrity entrepreneur Kevin O’Leary revealed he was one of the buyers . The record-setter is now part of the WonderShyne Index, a collection of ultra high-end cards acquired by collectibles platform Secure. 2. 2006-07 Upper Deck Exquisite Collection Michael Jordan-LeBron James Dual Logoman Autogra",

(Credit: Getty Images) By Will Stern — January 22, 2026 Share It is a fool’s errand to offer any sort of grand unified theory that measures the quality of a collection. Whether speaking of the thrift-store scavenger or the wealthy, monocle-wearing bidder, there is nothing that can possibly provide an objective rationale for the non-monetary motivation for collecting. Rarity, sentimental value and cultural merit are all measuring sticks, but none of those aspects carry the same weight to multiple observers. Still, by every metric under the sun, not the least of which being pure financial excess, Jim Irsay accumulated one of, if not the , greatest cultural collections in history during his life. And the upcoming sale of his collection at Christie’s in March is poised to be one of the most significant in history — right up there with the estate sales of Paul Allen and Malcolm Forbes. Before we get into some of the highlights of the collection and the stories behind them, it’s important to note just how crucial the role of provenance plays in an auction like this. While the term often refers simply to chain of custody, often for authenticity purposes, in special cases, it becomes a value driver itself. This is certainly true with respect to the Irsay Collection, as one can expect all of the items sold this year to prominently feature “former Irsay Collection” in the lot description each time a piece is re-sold. Irsay’s collection i",

(Credit: Getty Images) By Will Stern — January 20, 2026 Share A new record price has been paid for a Stephen Curry jersey. Curry’s jersey from Game 6 of the 2022 NBA Finals, the only one he wore in the Warriors' title-clinching victory in Boston, sold for $2.45 million in a private sale that was announced over the weekend. Curry scored 34 points in the game and won his only NBA Finals MVP. The jersey was previously sold in 2022 by Barry Meisel of Meigray for $1.7 million. Meisel confirmed to cllct the initial sale was conducted through the Meigray Golden State Warriors game-worn program. The new price paid is the highest ever for a Curry gamer, besting the previous record of $1.758 million paid last year for the second game of the star’s career in which he scored the first 3-pointer of his career. The most expensive Curry card ever sold fetched $1.08 million, making this jersey the most valuable Curry-related piece of memorabilia to sell publicly. The buyer was represented by Curio Advisor and wishes to remain anonymous. \"With this Curry jersey, there’s already a precedent established for his high-end market, so we can use previous comparable sales times his market multiple to find valuations that are comfortable for both parties,\" Curio Advisor's Bradley Calleja said. \"There’s more buy-side demand in sports memorabilia right now than I’ve ever seen, especially with items of the highest quality. \"We’ve also never had more engagement from institutions, investment funds and even count",

(Credit: Heritage Auctions) By Kevin Jackson — December 21, 2025 Share \"And now there's a steal by Bird ... underneath to DJ, he lays it in!\" Johnny Most's famous call from Game 5 of the 1987 Eastern Conference finals ranks in Boston Celtics lore and symbolizes one of the last gasps of the Larry Bird-led dynasty of the 1980s. Just when it appeared Isiah Thomas and the Detroit Pistons were about to dethrone the Celtics, Bird stole Thomas' inbounds pass and helped Boston steal Game 5. The Celts would go on to win the series in seven games as Bird had 37 points, nine rebounds and nine assists in the clincher to give Boston its fifth trip to the NBA Finals in the 1980s. The jersey Bird wore in all four home games of that classic East finals sold for a record $524,600 on Saturday, setting a new mark for the most ever paid for a Bird jersey. The white jersey is photo-matched to seven playoff games during Boston's 1987 run and also appears on the June 8, 1987, cover of Sports Illustrated with the headline \"Celtic Pride.\" The jersey was worn by Bird in the first half of Game 5, but not when he made the historic steal in the game's final seconds. The Celtics went on lose the 1987 NBA Finals in six games to the Lakers, and Detroit would fully take the baton the following season by winning the first of its back-to-back championships.

          "text": "Extended Bidding Updates - 10.21.25 Alt Auctions October 21, 2025 Testing Updates to Alt Auctions Extended Bidding After hearing feedback from our community, we’re testing out removing the 10-second timer phase of Extended Bidding . While it was intended to keep auctions moving, it created inconsistencies and moments that didn’t meet our standards for reliability or user confidence. Our engineering team is fully focused on making Alt Auctions the most consistent and stable experience in the hobby. If you’re not fully aware of what Extended Bidding is, let’s get into it! Every Thursday at 9pm ET / 6pm PT, Alt Auctions enters Extended Bidding; this is the final stage of each weekly auction where competition heats up and bids come in fast. 💥 Bidding is open for everyone Extended Bidding is open to all — no qualifying bids are required. Once the timer begins, anyone can join in and place a bid at any time. ⏰ How the timer works When any card in the auction receives a bid, the entire auction timer resets to 0 . The auction only ends once no new bids are placed across any items. This structure ensures fairness and gives every bidder a chance to respond in real time. 🕐 Why we're taking out the 10-second timer While the 10-second phase was originally meant to keep auctions moving quickly, it has created inconsistent experiences and moments of confusion. Removing it simplifies the close, strengthens stability, and helps ensure a more reliable bidding flow for everyone participating. This is a testing phase for us and we're hoping to get it right for you! 🏦 Payment periods after auction close Once the auction ends, buyers have a short window to finalize payment details: Under $10K: 1 hour to update payment method Over $10K: 5 days to update payment method If checkout isn’t initiated within that period, the payment method on file will be charged automatically. ✂️ Half bidding on high-value cards One hour into Extended Bidding, half bids are activated on all cards priced at $20",

That’s why we’re launching Alt Rewards , the most inclusive benefits program in the hobby. Whether you’re selling casually or moving high volumes, Alt Rewards helps you earn more on every sale. No sign-ups. No entry requirements. Just more upside, automatically. What’s New? Alt Rewards is built to give you full transparency into what you’ll earn with each sale. Your status updates each quarter based on how much you sell, and the more you sell, the more you make. It’s that simple. How It Works Your quarterly transaction total —from Alt Auctions and Fixed Price sales—determines your Alt Rewards status. At the start of each new quarter, your total resets, and you have the chance to level up again. There are four tiers : Base : Under $25,000 Silver : $25,000 – $100,000 Gold : $100,000 – $300,000 Black : Over $300,000 Your status determines your bonus payouts, seller fees, and access to exclusive benefits like unlimited shipping, premium support, and special events. Your status is valid for the remainder of a quarter, plus the following one; however, your quarterly transaction total resets to $0 at the start of every quarter. Track your progress each quarter under My Alt in the Alt app. 📈 Rates & Benefits Here’s what you unlock at each tier: Alt Auction Payout Rates (based on total submission value) Earn up to 115% of the sale price depending on your tier and submission value at the time of submission. What does submission value mean? Review our glossary below for all the details! Fixed Price Seller Fees (based on final card sale price) Enjoy lower seller fees the more you sell.

To maintain marketplace safety, funds earned from your sales will be available for payout within 3 days after delivery confirmation of the item. After we’ve seen ongoing confirmation of successful deliveries, you’ll start receiving your funds again 2 days after the buyer pays. eBay customer service told me that it is because my sales increased dramatically from last year. They've made it clear multiple times that I haven't done anything wrong and there are no restrictions on my account. That is fine and I understand why they do this. However, I'm getting conflicting reports as to if this is permanent or temporary, both from eBay and around the internet. Has anyone else gone through this? Is this a permanent thing or not? Unfortunately, my business model centers on quick sales with low profit margins, so this is negatively impacting sales because I can't get the inventory I need fast enough.",

          "text": "Quick PSA + Clarifications + Current Pharmacy Turnaround Times Pharmacy Turnaround Times Update: SmartScripts is currently experiencing longer turnaround times due to elevated order volume from the last couple of weeks with the storms and the recent orders. If timing is important to you, Hallandale is the faster option right now. **PSA: Read this before you submit your intake. Your selections are final once you check out.** Hey everyone, just a quick heads-up for anyone new or about to place an order, since this caught a few people off guard recently. Once you complete checkout on your intake form, your selections are final for that order. That means no pharmacy switches, no plan changes, no cancellations, and generally no refunds after submission. The reason is that this is prescription treatment. As soon as you submit, your intake is transmitted to an independent licensed provider for review. If treatment is deemed appropriate, a prescription may be issued and sent to the selected pharmacy very quickly. At that point, the process is already in motion. Before you hit submit, please take a moment to carefully review: \\- Your treatment selection \\- Which pharmacy fulfillment option you chose (Hallandale vs SmartScripts) \\- Monthly vs quarterly plan \\- Your medical history answers A quick review during intake can prevent issues afterward. The one exception is if a provider determines treatment is not appropriate based on your medical history. In that case, your order will be canceled and you will receive a full refund. If you notice a mistake before completing checkout, you can fix it. Use the back button inside the intake form in the upper left corner. Please do not use your browser's back button, as it can cause the form to glitch. We hope this helps prevent confusion and frustration. If you have questions, feel free to ask.",

Spent days on end tinkering, trying apps, setting up launchers, getting meta data, installing apps and pushing the thing as far as I can with HD packs and the like. The thing is, now I have pretty much everything up and running, I find myself not really using it. I think I enjoyed the tinkering and problem solving of getting things to run, such as gamehub/ gamenative games, project Zomdriod, the 3ds HD packs and Wii U controls for Mario Galaxy. Now most things either run well or I've hit a wall where they aren't likely to according to various community sources, I find myself going to play something much as Pokemon ZA on Eden or FF Crisis Core on Gamenative and end up just switching to my MSI Claw, Switch 2 or PS5/ PS Portal as generally the MSI handles emulation better or being Windows can just run the games without needing emulation and obviously the PS5 and Switch 2 play things without issue. I love the duel screens, but at nearly 44, outside of nds, wii U or 3ds, I don't really use both unless I'm reading a guide while trying to sort something out as I don't have the brain power to play a game and actually take in anything in a meaningful way other than what's on the top screen without pausing. So I'm wondering, now the tinkering is done, is it worth hanging onto for anything outside of 3DS emulation and smaller form factor than my Claw. The prices for them on Ebay here in the UK are going for around the price I paid for it or more and I'm just worried that now I don't seem to be using as much, it will decrease in value as the batches get shipped out and I'll lose money if I decide to part with it in the near future. Anyone have any hot takes to talk me into/ out of selling?",

I finally spoke to a human today but he was from the “online price guide” department and couldn’t transfer me to anyone. It’s been such a hassle to just pay for my submission. I can’t pay it online for some stupid reason. Most annoying experience ever. It took me like 9 days to get to a human and when I do, he essentially said “I can’t do anything”.

          "text": "question about gifting my friend as someone living in the usa? hi! i have a friend i met online who lives in argentina and is not financially well off. for christmas i wanted to buy her some things and send it to her (the process of researching and trying to figure things out took me a couple weeks so.. here we are after christmas 😮💨). i was planning on a dsi, charger, and mario kart game for it. i live in the usa, so the shipping on ebay was absolutely diabolical, and a DNI that matches the payment method is needed for both amazon and mercado libre, and apparently eventually ebay. i'm 18 and have a good paying job but unstable hours plus parents that don't know about me having friends i met online, so i can't spend a crazy amount because i don't want them to see something insane on my bank records and interrogate me about it (but i also cannot afford that)... what am i supposed to do about this if i cannot provide a DNI, or her DNI wouldn't work as it does not match the ID on the payment method? i can't transfer her money directly so that she can buy it herself, neither of us have money sending apps. is there a local business in argentina that sells these things and would be able to ship it to her without needing the DNI and without super expensive international prices? if all else fails, i want to be able to send her a visa/mastercard gift card or prepaid card, but i haven't been able to figure that out either, that was a whole thing in and of itself 😭 if anyone can help me out with this i would be so grateful 🥹🥹",

          "text": "Topps Cosmic Chrome is my absolute favorite product in the Topps baseball line. (To each their own, I know). I bought three cases in 2022. Then in 2023 it jumped from $185 a box north of $275. I only got one case. Then last year it was $350 a box. I just bought two individual boxes. Fast forward to 2025 and we’re now at $549 a box. Up 295% from its release pricing just three years ago. For the first time, I won’t be buying any boxes at all. Michael Rubin and Fanatics are a cancer on this hobby. They’ve gone full heel turn and taken on the villain role; and he doesn’t even pretend to give a shit. He’s catering exclusively to breakers. He’s basically told me; and all the other average everyday buyers of wax, that we’re no longer needed. Please. I’m asking you. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. STOP BUYING INTO BREAKS. STOP PAYING THE INSANE PRICES THAT FANATICS IS SELLING FOR. If you all keep buying; they’ll keep raising prices higher and higher; with no end in sight. SAVE THE HOBBY. STOP BUYING TOPPS/FANATICS. And before all you “it’s free market economics blah blah” people chime in... no. It’s not. The Hobby has become a casino. It’s gone from an industry who sold to fathers and sons; to one that uses every trick in the book to make you believe you’re one pack away from life changing money. The lights. The noise. The breaker screaming at the top of their lungs. The bullshit “that spot is paid” (when it’s def not). It’s all a psy-op to get you more addicted to the point you can’t stop. The one and ONLY thing that will combat this; is to stop buying. Period.",

Klarna has been giving me an ID Verification error on any purchase I try to make in the app. So I thought if I just put $200 into my Klarna balance I should be able to spend that with no problem in the app. I was wrong. I added the card to my Apple Wallet and tried to pay that way (for a PAY NOW purcase in the Klarna app for an ebay gift card) and it says \"We cannot process your card.\" So I tried using the actual Klarna debit card # for the purcahse and I get the same error. I don't see a way to choose KLARNA BALANCE at checkout. But I show a $200 balance in my account. So now I don't have the $200 in my bank account anymore AND Klarna won't let me spend it. What is going on?! How can I buy a freaking gift card in their app?!? I have been on chat hold for almost 24 hours waiting for a supervisor about the ongoing ID Verification problem.

Some guy says “it’s $49 on EBay” and Devon freaks out and lays into him saying it’s the wrong one. I looked too and it was the same one. The thing finally sells for $69 and he’s going crazy about how low it was. I couldn’t resist and I put “guess he overpaid by $20” and he banned me instantly. I totally see why he did it but it just shows how many of these whatnot sellers are just BS artists. Should I have kept my mouth shut? Yes, but sometimes I can’t resist stirring the pot.

TDLR: buyer opened chargeback through their CC 147 days after recieving the item Today, i recieved an update from ebay that the dispute details were updated. https://imgur.com/a/TV8O51P I can challenge the dispute of course and they gave me another 5 days to upload screenshots and type, etc. Not sure if this is good news/normal? It has been 17 days since i challenged the dispute the first time, where I only uploaded 2-3 screenshots of me offering open returns to the buyer etc. So far i've gathered 11 total screenshots ranging from conversations with the buyer, signature confirmation by the buyer, etc. UPDATE: i received an email from ebay \"We’re letting you know that this dispute is eligible for eBay Seller Protection. You’re not responsible for the dispute amount and the dispute fee. We’ll close the dispute once we receive the final outcome from the buyer’s payment institution. Right now there’s nothing you need to do.\" I guess this is somehow related to the change in dispute reasoning because if it stayed as \"doesnt match description\" i was most likely going to be scammed out of the bracelet and money. I called ebay who happily informed me (they wouldn't budge on letting me know who the dispute was through, mastercard, visa, etc) that it was through PAYPAL. i was told that no matter what they decide, i would not have to pay a dime. we will see because the same way the customer changed the reason for dispute today, im assuming they can just change it back whenever. Before i respond to the dispute, i wanted to come here and ask for help because that's what i was told to do last time when i responded first, then asked for help second lol.",

I am very NeuroDivergent A Lair of Disappointment: How Wizards of the Coast’s Botched Secret Lair Drop Became a Scalper’s Paradise Byline: Jonathan Fink Date: October 19, 2025 For thousands of Magic: The Gathering fans, Monday, October 13th, was a day marked by anticipation. It was the launch of the \"Secret Scare Superdrop,\" a highly sought-after collection of premium, limited-edition card sets. But within minutes, that anticipation devolved into a now-familiar ritual of frustration, futility, and fury. Customers who logged on at the 9 a.m. PST launch were thrust into a virtual queue, with wait times ticking into hours. The most agonizing part, however, wasn't the wait. It was the false hope. Multiple players reported the same crushing experience: after finally getting through the queue two hours later, they would successfully add the desired $40 bundles to their cart. They would proceed to checkout, enter their payment and shipping details, and click \"confirm.\" Only then would they be met with an error message: the items were sold out. Their carts were empty. The product had been sold from under them while they were typing in their credit card number. This \"cart jac",

A bit of background: I sold a limited edition Funko Pop (9,500 pcs) on eBay. I uploaded detailed close-up photos showing the box was in perfect condition ,no creases or damage. It sold quickly since I listed it at a lower price than others. The buyer paid immediately, and I shipped the next day. I packed it extremely well: layers of bubble wrap, plenty of padding, and “fragile” tape all around. The Pop was also in a protective case. I even took photos of the packaging before sending it out. The parcel was delivered on October 3rd, but today the buyer requested a return and refund, claiming the box was damaged. I compared the photos, and it’s definitely not the same box I sent it looks like they swapped it. I also checked their profile and saw they resell similar figures for almost double the price. It’s been 8 days since delivery, and I already received my payout. What are my options here? How should I handle it through eBay if I’m confident they switched the item? Thanks in advance for any advice!",

I list this as the only shipping type, and there is no issue listing this in this manner setting up the listing. However, on checkout, eBay does not allow me to select large envelope as the shipping type on an order. When I search and find \"large envelope\", it is grayed out and it says that shipping type is not allowed for the class of item. The cheapest shipping allowed on the site is Ground Advantage, which usually costs twice as much. Is there a way to bypass this restriction? I have been marking as shipped and buying postage at USPS, but then it doesn't come with tracking which causes other problems. Thx",

We all see ebays popups saying \"lower your handling time to 1 day\" to get a theoretical increase in sales and I believe its required to get TRS rated. Anyhow, there are several times where I will often ship within an hour or 2 of getting the item sold notice - full product packaged for shipping, label printed, attached, and dropped off at the post office and off it goes. Ive seen people discussing accepting ebay offers on their listed items but getting a payment failed notice. Does it ever happen for auctions or BIN item sales? If so, what happens if you've already shipped the order and then a day or 2 later while the funds are stuck in processing - you get a payment failed notice. Will ebay cover the payment and go after the buyer?",

I tried multiple stores including aliexpress ebay Amazon and they all say there was issues with the payment. Im not sure what the problem is. If I have to use it in person that's fine but I'm nervous it's going to decline in-store too. I've called customer service but it's only a bot that answers and no real people.

Mythic rares and rares often command higher prices,especially if they are staples in popular constructed formats like Standard,Modern,or Commander. However, if a set as a whole is not highly sought after, even these rarer cards can end up in clearance bins.

I got 5 boxes for free due to Amazon points, and I bought 11 boxes, so I paid about... $3,210 on Innistrad Remastered Collector boxes. I've been selling the cards via TCGPlayer, and I offloaded the bulk for $10 at a LGS. Here are my results! This was just a fun experiment, I wanted to chase a serialized Edgar, and see how much of the value I could recoup. Also: I saved a handful of cards for my own commander decks, and I saved a set of foil poster cards for my own collection, so there's probably about \\~$200 in cards that I'm keeping for personal use. Anyhow... * Cost: \\~$3,210 * Bulk card sale: $10 * Rest of cards sold via TCG: \\~$2,140 * Total: $2,150 / $3,210 = 67% So I made about 2/3 of my money back overall. Granted several of the boxes I got for free, so it would have been less if not for that. I did not get a serialized card unfortunately. I ended up buying one later, so yes... it would have been financially smarter for me to just buy the serialized and not bother opening boxes. However: opening boxes was fun so whatever. Fun experiment. Probably will not do it again unless I stumble into some \"fuck you\" money. Thanks for listening to my ted talk.",

I've had problems with impulse buying before however it was always real life shopping in a mall or a store and was about much smaller amounts. I think it's important to mention that I suffer with bpd and currently I'm very lonely and looking for ways to escape the reality full with boredom and loneliness which I think was the main factor to this breakout. Even though I realized the amounts I'm spending and that I'm having a serious problem and I'm trying to control it, I'm still opening the app a few times a day and scrolling looking for anything good. Whenever I see anything I want it takes me less than a minute to go to checkout. What do I do? How do I stop this? I'm not in a dangerous financial situation but at this point I feel stupid and annoyed at myself for this. Is anyone else having the same problem? How do I distract myself?",

          "text": "What I redeemed vs. what I ended up getting I started with the biggest Cardinals card that's ever been made. I bought it on eBay after selling a huge Yankees card from Triple Threads Topps decided they couldn't make the card. 3 of the 10 guys on it have now passed away. It's not unreasonable, but they substituted the first card here without even an email or a question, despite multiple emails saying I did not want a substitution. A Shohei auto /199 die cut. It's dope, but it's not even close to what I wanted, despite it being worth almost the same as what I paid for the redemption originally. I called Topps and spoke with a dude named Jesse. He was floored at the names on my original redemption. He sent a message to the redemption team requesting some Cardinals stuff to make up for failing to produce the card I desired so much, but made no guarantees. Fast forward a week and a half, and I had another shipment coming from Topps. They sent me a Gilded Collection Pujols auto /10 and a sweet Goldy relic /10 from Diamond Icons, I think it's a piece of his elbow guard. Jesse, you're the man. This isn't what I originally wanted but the extra swag you convinced the redemption team to send me softens the blow quite a bit. At least I have a couple sweet PC cards to put in my display case and may end up selling the Shohei to make my money back. Topps sure as hell ain't perfect, but they made this right, and I appreciate it. Hope y'all had a great Easter and enjoy seeing these beastly cards!",

          "text": "Cost for Beckett vs PSA Everyone is always so fast to crap on PSA because of the cost and how they handle the insured values. I was (am?) planning on doing my first BGS sub because I have a card I think could genuinely get a Black Label, and I think it would be cool to get. I was planning to do the 20-day service, which is $35. $5 cheaper than PSA 20-day service. Cool. But wait, after insuring the card and paying return shipping, the order cost $12 more than the same thing would be at PSA? And that is with only $1000 insurance. I realisitcally would want 2000-3000 insurance. With PSA, I could choose the $500 insurance range, and if the final grade pushes it too far over that point, I would just get charged the extra. Much better system. With PSA I can \"undershoot\" the value. If it grades a 10 and goes way up, they just charge the difference. But with Beckett, I cant do that. I have to plan for the most expensive and pay for it, or risk being under-insured on return shipping? And if I pay for the insruance of a 10 or black label, but I get a 9 or 9.5, I am just out a ton of money wasted on insurance. What a joke. Maybe I will check with CGC.",

          "text": "Pricing: a guide(ish) A fair amount of the questions in this sub are about pricing, and I thought I’d put together a short guide to help newer bookkeepers navigate this aspect of things since pricing can be tricky. The most common piece of feedback I’ve seen given here by experienced bookkeepers is that you don’t have enough information from the client. It’s not enough to know the number of accounts and number of transactions. You need to know the COMPOSITION of those transactions. If a client has 300 transactions, are those 10 invoices via direct ACH deposit and 290 simple expenses via credit card that can be sorted via auto add rules? Or is it a cacophony of 147 invoices in a POS system where fees need to be entered manually or via a clearing account, 16 returns, 4 credit card credits, 34 checks that need to be verified against the bank statement, 8 transfers to PayPal, 10 owner’s draws, 2 random AR in Quickbooks because the POS wasn’t compatible with a few client payments, 6 loan payments split between principal and interest, 8 payroll transactions (4 for wages, 4 for taxes), 2 charges for little Betty’s soccer camp that should’ve been on the client’s personal card instead, 15 purchases of fixed assets (via accrual basis, needing original cost and depreciation sub accounts created for each one, each time a new asset is added to the books), and 47 simple expenses (i.e. monthly software subscription costs, utilities, etc..)? To give the right pricing, you need to ask the right questions. Does the client want to track individual invoices per customer name or are they okay with recording more general bulk sales deposits? Do they want to track by location, by project, by product line (class and location tracking). Do they want receipt tracking? How is your client currently keeping their books? Will you have to transition them into new software or are they already set up? Do they accept USD only or do they accept 14 foreign currencies? Do they sell on just Etsy? Or Ets",

After about a hour between 2-3 streams I was pretty much set on never opening the app again. The one that did me in was a streamer selling a 2024 Allen and Ginter base mini Jackson Chourrio and was overly pissed at the chat that it sold for “only” $6. Blatantly lying to the buyer that they “printed money” on overpaying on a base card (last sold for a $1.49 a few days ago on eBay) Not to mention one streamer was adding Wander Franco cards randomly to auctions for no reason.

          "text": "Opinions on where to set up shop online? I have a shop, website (currently under construction to speed up processes, ease of checkout and better inventory system) as well as an eBay store where I mainly sell basketball cards; but have a little of everything. I decided to open the eBay store 3 years ago to try and widen my audience to help get rid of some basic cards that were taking up too much room, but still selling all my graded cards or even raw cards worth money that had been pulled. So basically a decent balanced selection....I’ve been a Top Seller on eBay since month 3 of my store being opened. I had to upgrade my store within the first year, because I was expanding so quickly with the amount of cards, memorabilia, and sports card products. At this point, I’m still a Top Seller and everything was going smoothly as I have around 1K cards or listings active right now. February marked my first month of not being a Top Seller, but Above Average due to eBay hitting my metrics with stuff like “tracking not uploaded or updated”, “Not shipped on time”, and a refund to a customer who lives outside the US and used a reshipper to get his card via PWE and complained within the first week and then on week two opened an “item not received request”. I’ve contacted eBay about all kinds of issues and it’s just circle talk, they won’t allow you to speak with a supervisor. They just put you off on someone else in the same department and won’t answer any questions or issues as an actual human. They just circle back around again.....so I’m ready to close up shop and set up on a different platform where I can still bulk upload, and hopefully bulk edit. So, ridiculously long story short....if you were going to or have started from scratch on a platform with 1K cards or so, what platform would that be? I’m a member of a lot of platforms, some that are semi-private and the rest wide open to the public. All fine with me. But I hate eBay so much right now and have since around October-",

This seems to be self-explanatory but you'd be shocked how few bother. When it potentially impacts gifts, you don't want to make that mistake, as there might not be time for you to correct the issue. - Expect carrier delays Happened last year, should happen again this year. Check the tracking on eBay to see what it says first. If it's been scanned along the way, then be patient. The seller already did their part. They are not responsible for any delays nor do they have any extra insight into the tracking information that you do not. If it's been a long while, don't panic. The odds your package has truly been lost is remote. But do NOT open a case on the seller right away. That puts their funds on hold over something out of their control and puts a short time frame on potentially fixing the problem. Only do this if they are not responsive to your inquiries. Any seller worth a damn will put out a USPS Search and 99 percent of the time that gets the package moving again within a week. Communicate and give them the time. It's just as frustrating for a seller. - Note the seller's processing times Some sellers are able to ship same / next day. Many are not. The listings say this, so be sure to note that before purchase or at least before reaching out. I know ours says 1-3 business days. The sheer number of messages we get after 1 business day (or even same day) asking about shipping times is amazing. Listing says it won't necessarily make it out that fast in plain sight. - Shop EARLY. Like now. Right now. This is when the pro eBay sellers have their stuff up. If you see what you want, buy it. Don't wait days or weeks or later, expecting it to be there. Things start to move pretty quick this time of year and if you wait around, you'll miss it.

Recently sold my first item, a local guy met with me and that was easy. I thought it was pretty ridiculous to charge him tax but ebay is the broker and whatever. Ebay makes me download the ebay app to allow it to use my camera to scan his code. That pissed me off, why can't I just use the web based service and enter an alpha-numeric code sent to his account? Why do I have to download an app?? Ok whatever I'll delete it later move on to the next issue.... Guy scans his code, verifies purchase and I go on to try amd transfer my money. And they put a hold on it to protect the seller. The guy let me scan his code and he checked the item out but ok, I can see the reason for that. Not every seller is like me and you cant pick and choose so ok. Next issue... I wait the 2 days or whatever to get paid. Log back in and it says it's my fund until they can verify me and I need to add my bank account. ABSOLUTELY NOT! I'm not adding my bank account to get hacked, no where did I read I need to add a bank account to get paid and that was the line in the sand. Found another option to take a 2$ fee to transfer the money to a debit card. Whatever but now ebay will have taken ~20% of the sale. So another F-U to ebay. Enter my card cause that's easy to replace if it gets hacked. And now it's telling me I have to wait another 48 hrs to get the account verified because even though I've used that card for all my ebay purchases the last 3 years I could be some criminal? I'll never sell anything on ebay again. To those that do sell periodically, your better people than me but I'll sell through market place from now on. Ebay takes too much money for way to complicated of a process and I would not care if the company collapses. Their model is antiquated and terrible for anyone that doesn't sell in volume. Sorry for the rant I just needed to vent, and best of luck to all you",

Released as part of 2025 Topps Chrome Update, Alter Ego features 10 of Major League Baseball’s most important stars — both current and retired — drawn as superheroes. The first major auction for an Alter Ego card delivered on those expectations earlier this month when the Shohei Ohtani “Sho Time” Superfractor 1/1, which depicts the Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star in white gloves with a top hat conjuring his samurai alter ego, sold for $105,000 in Fanatics Collect’s January Premier Auction . According to Card Ladder’s records, that result is the highest for any Ohtani insert sold at public auction and easily eclipses the previous public record of $6,999 paid for any other Alter Ego card. Though the cards have a comic book art style — something collectors have heavily gravitated toward in recent years with popular sets such as Panini America’s Kaboom or Manga and Leaf’s Anime Nation — Alter Ego artist Michael Blaskewicz credits his childhood room covered in posters of everything from Rickey Henderson, Lawrence Taylor and the Bash Brothers (Oakland Athletics sluggers Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire) to hip-hop groups KMD and Boogie Down Productions. “I thought of them as what their movie poster image would be,” Blaskewicz told cllct. “So instead of a comic book, flat, two dimensiona",

By Ben Burrows — January 21, 2026 Share They say a picture is worth 1,000 words ... but sometimes those words come from a different book. When Carlos Beltran was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Tuesday night, collectors might have started searching for his key rookie cards. Here's the problem: One of those cards, Beltran's 1995 Topps Traded rookie features a photo that is not the eventual Hall of Fame outfielder, but instead is a picture of a teammate who never climbed higher than Class AA. But Beltran isn't alone with this photo error — in fact, he's not even the first Hall of Famer to have an image of someone else pictured on his card. Here are seven baseball cards featuring an unfortunate case of mistaken identity. 1995 Topps Traded Carlos Beltran was elected to Cooperstown with 84% of the vote, but anyone hunting for his flagship rookie card will likely be disappointed. Included in 1995 Topps Traded, the front of Beltran’s rookie with the Kansas City Royals actually shows teammate Juan LeBron, an outfielder who would play 12 seasons of professional baseball, but never reached higher than AA in the United States. According to GemRate, Beltran’s mistaken rookie is by far his most graded card with more than 2,400 authenticated by PSA. PSA adds a designation reading “UER: Juan LeBron Pictured” to each. The public record for the card, according to data tool Card Ladder, is the $1,138 paid for a BGS 10 Pristine examp",

So, eBay has a new feature in their app. So, essentially, open the app, you click on my eBay, and you can just scroll down here to shortcuts and scan cards. Now, you notice mine says early access. However, you may or may not have that. So, just wait. I'm sure it'll be rolled out to everybody. But the thing is you can click on this here. It's a camera feature. And I have a 1968 um Brooks Robinson's playing card that you can put in here. And let's hopefully it works okay with my finger in there, but let's take a picture of it. And then it'll scan it. And so what you can see here is you can see that it's uh got a couple tabs up the top. Market data, pop report, and item description. You can al also um distinguish between sold and active. And here you see ungraded. You can look at the PSA 9 reports and so on. So, a really cool tool. I'll do it once again just so you can see it. I'll do it with a more modern card, a 2020 Show Otani base card. And you'll see it do its magic, do the work. It'll bring up this card. You select uh the type that it is. It is a base. That's the image. And again, you'll get lots of background information. Uh you can also select uh the months here. You can change it from 3 months to 7 days, 30 days, 1 year, 2 years. So as you can see, a really cool tool at your disposal if you have and utilize the eBay app. And you can utilize it to check graded cards or check raw cards and see what the pricing history has been over the last few days or years or months. So Pablo's cards always selling on eBay.",

Price Charting seems to be really good but a vendor was telling me they go off of ebay last sold, but Price Charting had last sold prices on ebay... What’s your go to for tracking your collection?

          "text": "I got tired of using 5 different apps to price cards for my shop, so I built my own AI-powered alternative. (Beta Access) I own a small card shop in the UK (Devon based!), and for years I’ve been frustrated with the \"pricing shuffle\"—switching between eBay, a calculator, five different pricing apps, and static price guides just to give a customer a fair price. It was slow, and half the time the data was lagging or inaccurate. So, I decided to do something about it. I’ve spent the last few months building **Price This**—a fully AI-powered intelligent market pricing system. **What makes it different?** **1. The \"Ultimate Average\" (Base Layer):** We don't just guess. We pull data from **PriceCharting, CardMarket, TCGPlayer, and Google results**, extrapolating and averaging their market prices to establish a solid global baseline. **2. The AI & Real-Time Intelligence (Top-Spec Layer):** Once we have that baseline, we apply our **Human-Reasoning AI** and **Official eBay Partner Data**. Instead of just using \"Yesterday's Data,\" the AI detects changes in real-time. It filters out \"wash trading,\" shill bids, and outliers. It \"thinks\" like you do: *\"Oh, one just sold for this much? It's from this set, this era, holds this popularity... therefore the real-time price is THIS.\"* **3. Kiosk Mode:** A feature I built specifically for vendors/traders. You can visualize a trade live, input cash vs. trade credit, and let the app calculate the mathematically perfect deal. **4. The Vault:** Tracks your profit, not just value. See your buy-in cost vs. current value and get volatility warnings before a card crashes. **I’m just one guy building this.** We aren't a massive corporation. It’s just me and a friend, building this for the community. **We launch Early Access on Feb 1st.** Most of the app (including the AI pricing) is free. If you join the beta now, you get a **Founders Badge** and a permanent discount on any future Pro features. I’d love for you to roast it, break it, and tell ",

          "text": "I’ve been in the hobby for a while and mostly buy singles, but I wanted to try Fanatics Collect’s Instant Rip just to see how everything works. Dropped $250 on a basketball pack just out of curiosity. I actually pulled a legit grail: a 2014 LeBron James patch card. Their system immediately showed a “value” around $1,400, which made no sense at all. Realistic value is maybe $500 to $600. So I skipped their whole end-of-process valuation and took the $1,200 instant credit. That part was easy. Everything after that... not great. The user interface feels like it was designed by someone who doesn’t collect. It’s clunky, the layout is strange, and finding basic info takes more taps than it should. Their weekly auction structure also feels odd. Maybe there’s a reason for it, but from the outside it just seems limiting. Their Card Ladder pricing is rough. They’re pulling comps from 2022, so you basically have to bounce between eBay and their app to figure out real values. It slows everything down and makes it hard to trust what you’re looking at. I used my $1,200 credit toward an overpriced 1980 Topps Bird–Magic–Dr. J rookie PSA 7 listed at $1,600. I paid the extra $400 cash to cover the difference and added it to my collection. Cool. Then I tried to withdraw it. They hit me with a $75 fee. $48 to “withdraw” the card, with no explanation or breakdown. $25 shipping. Plus tax. Paying $75 just to get a card in hand is wild. It makes the whole thing feel like a cash grab built on keeping you inside their ecosystem and charging you every time you try to leave it. At this point I’m deleting the app and won’t be using it again. That’s just my experience, but it was enough for me.",

After years of collecting and trading at events across the US, we kept encountering the same problems every serious collector faces. Tracking our collection values was a mess of spreadsheets. Organizing potential trades meant juggling eBay sold listings, price guides, and scattered notes. And we never really knew our portfolio's true performance over time. **Sound familiar?** So we built CardNexus - a modern portfolio tracker designed specifically for collectors who actually care about the value and organization of their collections. **What we've built so far:** * 🆓 A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch) * 💸 Real-time price syncing across multiple marketplaces * 📊 Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early * 🗂️ Custom lists for trading, selling, or just organizing your collection * 🌍 Multi-category support: TCGs (Magic, Pokémon, Lorcana) and soon sports cards **This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on collector feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 8 weeks ago with the TCG community, but we're expanding to serve the broader collecting world. Today, we're opening 200 beta spots for r/collectors ! We're offering a **$200 collectibles credit** (your choice - TCGPlayer, eBay, or whatever marketplace you prefer) to one lucky member who joins via our link, uploads their collection, and creates a trade/sell list! **Get your invite here** —> [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=collectors](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=collectors) Our marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker w",

The card quality is typical of donruss from that period, which means there can be centering issues or soft corners sometimes. The card itself is relatively abundant, making it more affordable for many collectors. **1989 Fleer #548** The 1989 fleer card showcases walker in a batting stance. The fleer sets of the late 80s are known for their occasionally poor quality control, especially with print defects.This particular card, while common, can fetch a premium if it's well-centered and free from any markings or damage. **1989 Score #404** The 1989 score card presents walker in an action shot fielding a ball.

I thought I missed out on the Beta but just found the invite email. Gave the $25 starter pack a go and pulled a PSA 9 Ivysaur. The instant buyback offer was $25.20 but decided to keep it. Not a valuable card by any means, but I like it. GameStop is selling the card in their PSA graded store for $27.99 ($26.59 for pros). The 'Card Ladder Value' shows $30. [Pricecharting.com](http://Pricecharting.com) shows $34.29. PSA's estimated value, which is found by clicking on the Cert Number link in your vault, is $44.97. Is PSA just inflating the estimated value? Fighting the urge to buy another $25 pack.",

          "text": "2016 Donruss Optic: The Debut Set Hiding in Plain Sight In this episode, Brett examines a product that rarely gets treated like a true origin story. 2016 Donruss Optic was the first Optic. The first Gold Vinyl 1/1 in the brand. The first time Donruss moved to chrome stock. Yet it does not carry the same cultural weight as 2012 Prizm or 2013 Select. After spending time with his own Andrew Luck Gold Vinyl 1/1 run, Brett started asking a bigger question. Why doesn’t 2016 Optic get debut chrome respect? He breaks down: • Why Panini launched Optic in 2016 • How Optic fit into the product portfolio next to Prizm • The parallel hierarchy in football vs basketball • Why Gold Vinyl became hobby language • Why the market prices players first and sets second in this release He also pulls real sales data from Card Ladder to frame the conversation. Stephen Curry Gold Vinyl 1/1 sold for $25,000. LeBron James Gold Vinyl PSA 10 once sold for $4,495. Are those numbers reflecting origin status? Or is perception lagging behind structure? If you care about first year anything. If you chase Gold Vinyl. If you value context over comps. This conversation matters.

          "text": "The Football Card Podcast #34: Ricky Williams, Super Bowl MVPs, and the $70K Bryce Young Sale On this episode of The Football Card Podcast, Pack Nicholson and Brett McGrath break down one of the most fascinating football card weeks of the year. They start with Ricky Williams. The hype. The trade. The suspension. The comeback. And the uncomfortable truth that his top card sales still lag behind other running backs from his era despite 12,000+ scrimmage yards and 74 touchdowns. From there, they dive into market shock. A verified $70,000 Bryce Young Gold Vinyl Downtown. A $31K Matthew Stafford Superfractor rookie. A Derrick Henry 1/1 Select PSA 10 that raises serious Prizm vs Select questions. They also revisit the Legion of Boom, debate who becomes the face of quarterback liquidity in 2026, and examine what it really means to time a card sale on Super Bowl night. If you care about context over hype and understanding why certain players move markets while others stall, this episode delivers.

          "text": "The WNBA Card Podcast: The WNBA Finds Its Icons — Bird, Taurasi, and the Superstar Era with Elodie (@egintz5) This episode moves the WNBA Card Podcast into the early 2000s, when Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi reshaped how fans connected to the league and how collectors thought about WNBA cards. It was a time defined by team-first collecting, limited media coverage, and cards that reflected presence and performance rather than profit. Katelyn is joined by Elodie (@egintz5), a collector from France whose Sue Bird collection is built on commitment and distance. They talk through early card design choices that still matter today, including first game jersey cards, rookie redemptions, and on-card autos from an era before overproduction. The conversation widens to international collecting and the reality of building a collection without local card shops. Long shipping timelines, US mailboxes, and community built through trust. It is a reminder that WNBA cards travel far beyond the league’s borders and that players like Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi became anchors for collectors who stayed for the love of the game.

Pack and Brett work through the week that sits right on top of the Super Bowl and right in the middle of a Prizm release. The market is moving. Opinions are flying. Prices are changing in real time. They break down what cultural impact means for players like Shedeur Sanders and why performance alone no longer tells the full story. They look at Prizm in hand and how design, feel, and timing change perception. They dig into post playing day cards and why rigid rules often fall apart once a card hits your search results. You’ll hear why some collectors chase liquidity while others chase conviction. Why Kabooms command attention. Why certain golds feel overpriced until they don’t. And why patience keeps showing up as the hardest skill to learn. This is a conversation for collectors who trust their taste more than the comment section and want to build collections they can stand behind five years from now.

This episode goes back to where WNBA card collecting began. Katelyn sits down with Anne Marie of Women on Topps to unpack the late 1990s and early 2000s. A period when the league and the cards were being built at the same time. No rules. No roadmap. No expectations. They walk through the first licensed sets, cards that came in cans, early autographs, die cuts, shoe relics, and redemptions. More important, they talk about how collectors showed up back then. Team focused. Set driven. Community first. This conversation is about history. It’s about why this era still matters. And it’s about what modern collectors can learn from a time when collecting felt closer to fandom than finance.

(Credit: Getty Images) By Darren Rovell — May 10, 2024 Share Jerseys from the good ol' days are hard to find for a couple reasons. There's the supply issue, as players used to often wear the same uniforms for an entire season. And there also was an awareness issue, as game-worn items were not recognized as anything more than clothing decades ago. So, many of the greatest jerseys of all time were either passed off to a random person, or handed down to a minor-leaguer after logos and names were scrubbed off. Mickey Mantle's 1957 uniform, currently up for auction at Goldin, was saved by a minor-leaguer in Triple-A. The interlocking \"NY\" was scrubbed off in favor of the minor-league affiliate's \"Triplets\" nickname, but Mantle's name sewn into the jersey at the bottom tipped off the minor-leaguer that it was worth saving. Which brings us to one of the jerseys the memorabilia world is still looking for: Bobby Orr's jersey from the 1970 Stanley Cup final. This incredible piece of hockey history is still missing as we hit the 54-year anniversary of his famous \"Flying Goal\" on Friday. Several Orr jerseys have sold at auction through the years, but not the one from his most famous moment. (Credit: Getty Images) According to one memorabilia dealer in Massachusetts, a man once claimed to have Orr's jersey in his dusty basem",

They have been sitting in boxes since 1999. I logged it all into TCGplayer. Current value listed at about $28,800 with my estimated grades. I have a dealer offering to take it all for $20k pending inspection. I have noticed that there is a wide discrepancy for cards that are listed on TCG player versus recent eBay sales. Like in some cases hundreds of dollars difference. It’s easily possible that at current eBay sales prices, this collection is well over $30,000. More if I take the time to grade the sweeties. At $20k for this type of collection, am I leaving too much value on the table?",

          "text": "Not sure if I can send this complaint to Riot/Riftbound team directly but collecting cards in general is incredibly frustrating lately. Scalpers are the main issues but the secondary issue is when LGS BECOME the scalpers. There is no reason every single one of my 8 LGS in the area should be marked up to TCGPlayer prices. I have been collecting since 1996, Magic, Pokemon, Yugioh, Dragon Ball, Digimon the works. This day and age, collecting is looked at as a side hustle for a lot of people but LGS/LCS were always the last bastion of normalcy. Gonna throw a \"BACK IN MY DAY\" here, stores were disincentivized if they were caught marking up product past a certain point. Riftbound boxes being around $150/$170ish would be around that markup area. Neopets and WOTC used to straight ban stores from getting products, and still do to this day (Neopets) if distribution guidelines are not followed. I really suggest Riot take this route so Riftbound can be fun and affordable to enter more players hands at a local level. Well what about the scalpers you say? They will just buy out the LGS and relist on TCGPlayer. Do what Japan does. - Box limits per WEEK - Plastic cut on Booster Boxes - Some even go as far as cutting the top of packs on sale so they are no longer sealed. Scalpers hate all of this. What are you gonna do, list 36 packs whose seals are all broken? This game is awesome, I want it to thrive. I don't want it to become the frustrating circlejerk sphere that is Pokemon currently. If people cannot buy product affordably, they will leave.",

I understand it won't be sold, so it's a unique promotional card, so to speak. If you could send me a picture, that would be amazing, and I'd be incredibly grateful. Thanks\" I'm also seeing it being auctioned off in that same facebook group with one ending at $1510 and an ongoing one $650+. My LGS won't take them without a TCGplayer price and I'm curious what's the best path to consider offers? Is a Facebook group the best solution for collectors of these kinds of cards?

Then today I checked back and the order didn't go through. Many cards were removed from my deck, and after clearing and adding them again, I only had 63 cards and it said the rest were unavailable. After finding listings for the missing cards and adding them, I went to optimize and my two options contained 43 and 36 cards respectively. I didn't have this problem last time, and TCGplayer was bugging out a lot and refusing to let me add stuff to my cart. Is this a problem with TCGplayer servers or am I doing something wrong?

I remember when I checked TCGPlayer/Pricecharting for the ETB prices back in June, I had just bought one each with my girlfriend and she was considering holding onto one for the future to trade for sets down the line. I convinced her to open both and I got the charizard! However I've noticed the price of the ETB go up in the past 4 months from 80 dollars for an ETB to 140-170, while the top chase card has always actually been cheaper than the price of an etb. As a preface, I want to say that I'm not a scalper or anything, I just like looking at the prices of the cards I have. I'm just curious as to what the supply/demand balance is here and why prices for the etb are so high.",

Then life got real busy and my cards collected dust. Fast forward two years I saw all the cool new sets and want to start collecting again. My goal is to have a mostly complete binder for each set (minus the enchanteds and expensive legendaries and promos). I’ve already placed 2 cheap orders from TCGplayer. One with 60 commons, uncommons, rares from the first chapter to help fill in gaps in my collection and one with 2 d100 cards with nice art! I’ve compared prices between eBay and tcgplayer and it seems buying singles from tcg is much cheaper with a better selection! I know some basic rules like make sure the seller has good reviews and a decent amount of sales. Is there anything else I should know about the website to avoid fakes and get good value? I’m not looking for future resell value but I am trying to not overspend and get the best bang for my buck since I have a lot of catching up to do. I know to not buy sets right at release and wait for the market to settle. I’m familiar with the timing of the sports card market but this is a whole new world lol. The store championship Mirabel enchanted caught my eye since I loved encanto but I’m wondering if $~17 is a good price for it? It seems it’s continued to fall ever since release. With it being a rarely played card will it continue to fall lower and I can get it for $10 in the future? Or with store champs for that set over and all copies being given out will it rise back up? I know things are hard to predict but any guide/tips are appreciated! Thanks so much for reading",

          "text": "Value Help a.k.a How much is my card worth? Half the posts I see on the sub at this point are asking what the value of cards are. There’s a few different ways that you can find values online. 1. (130point.com) This site takes data from a bunch of different auctions and various websites all over the Internet. (eBay, goldin, Etc.) you can search by recent sales and a few other parameters. 2. (eBay completed/sold items) more or less the same as the first point it just gives you this information right on the eBay website. 3. (Local card Shops/Shows) Another great way to find out pricing is to go to a local card shop or a card show and see how much things are selling there. The market varies, but since Star Wars is not like sports where players can get hurt, the value rarely drops. 4. (Ask the sub) If every single method above has been used and no similar cards can be found then I think it is appropriate to make a post about it. I completely understand if there’s no similar cards out there, but I see a lot of people asking about cards that can be easily searched online. Cheers! Happy collecting",

(Credit: Getty Images) By Darren Rovell — January 12, 2026 Share The so-called \"frozen envelope\" has never emerged from the first NBA Draft Lottery in 1985, but the jersey now has. Brahm Wachter, Sotheby's head of modern collectibles, told cllct the auction house has been consigned the Patrick Ewing Knicks jersey that was onsite for the NBA lottery and the draft in 1985. The white home jersey, which was held up by Knicks executive Dave DeBusschere after New York won the lottery, has been photo-matched to both events. The lottery took place May 12, 1985, at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. Envelopes with logos of the seven teams that didn't make the playoffs were put into a drum and pulled out by NBA commissioner David Stern. When Stern pulled the logo of the team in the NBA's largest market, a conspiracy theory developed around the Knicks envelope being frozen or a corner being bent. Stern and the NBA denied all conspiracy theories, pointing to the fact the process was overseen by an independent accounting firm. The NBA later went to ping-pong ball combinations instead of logos on envelopes in order to create even more transparency.

Oppenheim bought the Super Bowl MVP jersey for $470,000, as it headlined the Super Bowl Live Auction conducted by Hunt Auctions. \"I would have gone higher,\" Oppenheim told ESPN, \"a decent amount higher.\" The $470,000 was already $270,000 more than the high estimate. He also bought Riggins' Super Bowl ring for another $105,750. Oppenheim, a lifelong Washington fan, told ESPN he that Riggins' iconic 43-yard touchdown run in the 27-17 victory is the most important play in team history. Super Bowl XVII marked Washington's first Super Bowl in franchise history and Riggins ran for 166 yards and a touchdown in the game. Oppenheim also told ESPN he intends to make the jersey and ring available for all Washington fans to see. \"I wanted to make sure these items were not controlled by someone who would hoard them, keep them from the fan base and have it as some type of investment opportunity,\" he said. \"I don't feel I own these things; I feel they're owned by the fans. To be a custodian is an honor. Matt Liberman is a reporter and video producer for cllct, the premier company for collectible culture.",

I’ve been selling on this platform since 2017, and when I started taking it seriously in 2020, things were amazing through 2024. But 2025 was rough, and it looks like this year may be heading in the same direction. Thankfully, I’ve expanded to other platforms and go live consistently on Whatnot, but it’s still frustrating. I went from making 4–6 sales a day to making that in a week if I’m lucky. The app is currently ranked #25 in the App Store, so it’s clearly not as popular as it once was.

He doesnt bother selling online anymore so he's not super up to date as to what releases become more expensive with time.

I'm a 47-year-old sales rep from Houston who spends half his life in airports and bouncing between client meetings. I've got maybe eight cards in my wallet—credit, debit, hotel keys, transit passes. A buddy of mine got his card skimmed at Hobby Airport last year, and someone cloned it. $1,200 in fraudulent charges before the bank caught it. That got me paranoid. I kept seeing ads for this Guardality Safe Card popping up, so I went down the rabbit hole of Googling \"Guardality Safe Card Protection reviews complaints consumer reports\" to see if it was legit or just another piece of plastic that does nothing. **Does It Work?** I couldn't find a formal \"Consumer Reports\" test on RFID blockers, so I grabbed one to test it myself. **Short Answer: Yes, but you have to understand it's about the material, not magic.** It uses advanced RFID-blocking technology—basically a metallic layer inside the card that creates a Faraday cage effect . When you place it next to your contactless cards, it disrupts the electromagnetic signals that scanners use to steal your data . **The Feeling:** The card itself is ultra-slim—about the thickness of a regular credit card, maybe 1.1mm . You slide it into your wallet next to your cards and honestly? You forget it's there. No bulk, no weight. That's the point. **The Test:** I was skeptical, so I did a real-world test. Before using Guardality, I held my work badge (which has RFID) up to the reader at my office—beep, instant access. Then I put the Guardality card behind it and tried again. **Nothing.** Dead silence. The reader couldn't detect it at all. That's when I knew the shielding was real . I've been carrying this in my wallet for the last month everywhere—airports, grocery stores, crowded stadiums. * **Peace of Mind:** The biggest win. I don't flinch anymore when someone stands close to me in line. * **Func",

          "text": "Childhood binder, are these worth something? Hey Reddit, I hope this post is allowed in the sub. I’d really appreciate any help or guidance! I’ve pulled out my old binder from childhood and think there’s potential value in these nine cards. I quickly checked a US price chart website for the holo cards I have, but all the prices are in US dollars. The central card seems like it might be worth a bit, but there appear to be two versions. Mine doesn’t have the Japanese text, but I’m struggling to find a good UK price. What’s the best way to sell these and price them correctly? I’m in the UK and was thinking maybe eBay is the only option, or should I try to find an event nearby to take these to? Anything else I should look for to ensure what I have are legitimate? E.g. the Pichu card seems to be a lighter shade of blue on the back bs the others? Thanks! Edit: Ok... thank you Reddit! This is kind of mad... I genuinely thought I might get some feedback of having a few hundred pounds there and just stick them on Ebay, not quite the scale some people are now suggesting. will be buying some sleeves and \"top loaders\" asap! I'm also sticking to the advice of ignoring my DMs for selling these for now until I understand what I'm actually sitting on.",

Last year, I was on Fanatics Live and on an impulse, bought the Braves in a 2 box ‘24 Topps Diamond Icon for a fair amount. It took 4 days to get down to the last few teams. They had to serial one due to the price then it was down to just the Nationals. The Nats were discounted several times over 6 hours and no bites. I offered 50 dollars for the laughs but they took it. 😂 The chat thanked me for “taking one for the team.” The break finally begins. The first box he pulls a Randy Johnson First Inscriptions card and the chat is excited and the host seems to be mildly amused and moves on to box 2. The third card he pulls causes his face to look like he’s going to puke. Here’s the pulls from the 20 cards total 😆. Which leads me to the question.....there’s not a ton of data that I can find. Should get the auto certified, get them graded, or go with raw?",

Now that's a pretty limited run these days. Well surfing the net and watching some YouTube vids has shown me that Backyard Breaks had 50 cases, or 10% of the entire print run. Filthbomb was given a similar allocation, so now we are at about 20% of the print run without factoring in a single other breaker that gets allocation from Fanatics. Single boxes are so limited on the secondary market that they are going for 5x. There are a grand total of 23 available to purchase on eBay at the time I'm writing this. Call me a doomer - I don't really give a shit - but this is why you couldn't get Black & White or Bob Ross. And when you cant get those, and you don't want to pay 5x guess where you're gonna go - to the breakers. EQL or not, this is why these products are sold out in less than 5 minutes. Get used to only buying low end products or be a part of the problem and feed the breakers. When I can't get my hands on a case of Platinum Chrome Anniversary Fanatics I will officially be 100% vintage. Good luck everybody.",

          "text": "Jimmy's Pokemon Deal Finder - A site that finds deals on Pokemon cards on eBay A few years ago, I got into Pokemon collecting, and I'd look for good deals on cards on eBay. For each card I was interested in, I'd search the card on PriceCharting and compare the listing price to the valuation from PriceCharting. I found this really slow and tedious so wanted a way to automate it. I wrote an eBay scraper and PriceCharting scraper in Python that would show listings from eBay where the listing price was lower than the PriceCharting value. It output the best deals to a text file sorted by price different percent so I could see the best deals. This worked really well and I used it for a while to get some good cards. A few years later, I'd been making programming projects for my personal website and decided to turn the deal finder script into a website. Site: https://www.jimmysdealfinder.com I got it working and posted it to the Pokemon TCG subreddits and had really good foodback on it (as well as some fair criticism that I've used to improve the site). I monetized it with eBay affiliate links and I'm now making about £200 a month from the site, with a peak month of £530 a couple of months ago. I'm really happy with how it's come along, and people seem to be actually using the site to find good deals. I get about 25 users a day and the average engagement time is around 2-3 minutes. I'm planning to expand it to other collectibles such as retro video games, Magic the Gathering TCG, Yugioh, and sports cards. Let me know if you check it out and have any feedback or ideas to improve the site. :)",

          "text": "How Much Does an Amazon Agency Charge? A Complete Pricing Guide for 2026 Hiring an Amazon agency can be one of the most important investments you make in your ecommerce business. Whether you’re launching a new product or scaling an established brand, the right agency can accelerate growth, reduce costly mistakes, and take over the time-consuming day-to-day tasks of Amazon account management. But the first question every seller asks is simple: **How much does an Amazon agency charge?** The short answer: **Amazon agency pricing typically ranges from $500 to $10,000+ per month**, depending on: * size and maturity of your brand * number of SKUs * services included * ad spend management * marketplace expansion goals * revenue level and growth targets The long answer requires a breakdown of pricing models and what’s actually included — and that’s exactly what we’ll cover below. # Common Amazon agency pricing models Most Amazon agencies structure their fees using one or more of the following models: # 1. Flat monthly retainer This is the most common structure. You pay a fixed monthly fee for a defined scope of services. **Typical range:** ➡️ $500 – $6,000 per month Best for sellers who want predictable billing and ongoing account support such as: * listing optimization * SEO and keyword research * inventory planning * customer service support * reporting and analytics * account health management # 2. Percentage of revenue Some agencies charge a percentage of your **Amazon monthly sales**. **Typical range:** ➡️ 5% – 15% of revenue This pricing model aligns incentives — the agency grows when you grow — but can become expensive for high-revenue brands. # 3. Percentage of ad spend (for PPC management) If the agency manages Amazon advertising, they may charge based on your monthly ad budget. **Typical range:** ➡️ 8% – 20% of ad spend This often includes: * campaign creation and structure * bid optimization * keyword harvesting * A/B testing * DSP management (if applicable) # 4.",

          "text": "After going deeper on Chrome NBA to see whether haywire sealed pricing and rare hit distribution actually had some correlation, a few people asked if the same approach could be applied to Chrome Update. I thought that was a fair question. Unlike Chrome NBA, Chrome Update does not have the cheat-code Hanger format. It also lacks a single format that has caught fire the way Breaker’s Delight did on the NBA side. That makes this exercise useful in a different way. It helps answer whether the big hits are concentrated in hobby formats, whether Value Boxes and Megas are truly as barren as they feel, or whether there is any sneaky value play that avoids paying up for hobby. **The questions this research tries to answer:** Which formats offer the best rare hit potential across hobby and retail? How many boxes of each format does it take to pull a rare hit? Are Breaker’s Delight boxes actually as loaded as they appear? Is there any realistic value in $40 Value Boxes or $70 Megas? **What qualifies as a “rare hit” here?** 1) **Parallels, autos, or inserts numbered /50 or less, including:** Gold, White, Orange, Black and Red base parallels, autos, and insert parallels, FrozenFractors, Superfractors, Printing Plates, Cupfractors Gold or better, Image Variations Gold or better, Radiating Rookie Autos, Dual and Triple Autos, Legend Autos, Cupfractor Autos, ASG Image Variations Gold or better, and Larry David Autos. 2) **Case hit or tougher inserts, including:** Radiating Rookies, Chrome Home Field Advantage, Helix, Major League Minis, Alter Egos, Exposé, Celebración, Mickey and Friends, and MLB Debut Patches. One important reminder: I can identify frequencies, not name distribution. Odds do not tell us which players land in which formats. We have to assume reasonably even distribution. If 90% of Nick Kurtz Gold autos are seeded into one format, the only way to know is by watching rips. **Enhanced Hit Frequencies** How many **Hobby** Boxes to pull: ≤50 parallel: 2.3 boxes Case hit",

          "text": "I often point out that the “Hit Frequency by Format” numbers I post (parallels per box, cards per box, etc.) are cumulative averages across all boxes within a format. The more I’ve watched this product get ripped, the more it feels like certain formats, especially Breaker’s Delight, are disproportionately landing bigger hits. We’ve seen some truly absurd cases (looking at you u/blezsportscards). That got me wondering whether the numbers themselves could help validate or challenge that perception across both hobby and retail SKUs. **How I approached this:** Instead of focusing on per-box averages, I asked a different question: How many boxes of each format does it take to pull a “rare hit”? I looked at two buckets: 1) **Low-numbered parallels (≤50 copies)** This includes Gold, Orange, Black, Red, Super, and Frozenfractor parallels, along with those same parallels of Basketballs, Pulsars, Raywaves, and Geometrics. I also included Image Variation and Auto parallels numbered /50 or less. I understand there are meaningful hits numbered higher than 50 (ex: Flagg Blue Auto /150, Flagg Green Image Variation /99), but those apply to only a handful of players and don’t materially change format-level dynamics. 2) **Case Hit or tougher inserts** These include Rock Stars, Let’s Go!, Ultra Violet, Radiating Rookies, Helix, Lightboard Logos, Hidden Gems, Advisory, Glass Canvas, Paradox, Patented, Fanatical, Finals, and Gold Logomen. Using published odds, I can calculate the frequencies of low-numbered parallels and Case Hits without much trouble. What I cannot account for is name distribution. Odds don’t tell us which players land in which formats. If 90% of Gold Cooper Flagg autos are seeded into Jumbos, I can't help you there. The only way to know that is by watching rips. **Quick side note:** Some base Geometric insert and auto parallels are insanely rare.

First, the inventory doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be. Second, if anything is good it is often over priced trying to drive you to sellers web age. Third, if I do find what looks to be a decent auction I always seem to lose as \"second highest bidder\". This last one happens so often now it has to be something fishy (even though I don't have proof). I also used to frequent the CGC forum's, inventory also seems scarce there. Are people just sitting on big books because market is down? I know about ComicLink, MyComicShop, and Heritage but would prefer more eBay style auctions. I personally hate social media so don't do Instagram, or whatnot. The later I can't stand you can barely inspect the book before someone buys. I want good pictures, not someone holding it in front of a camera for 5 seconds telling me what the grade is. I want a chance to grade it myself. I just tried FB Marketplace but frankly good stuff is rare where I live. Am I missing someplace, where did all the eBay buyers/sellers go? Feels like the online market is splintered and while I hated eBay for fees, it was a pretty safe place for buyers and it was kind of nice almost everyone/thing was there.",

We'd go to flea markets every weekend, and my dad and I would pick through boxes if we found them. Condition didn't matter, it was the checklists that I had. Stopped collecting by the time I was 16, and forgot what I had. I was at my parents this weekend, and pulled out the binder. I knew I had a decent amount of the set, but thought I was maybe halfway there... turns out I only have 51 to go, and the only \"big card\" I'm missing is Nolan Ryan! Set building was way harder pre-internet. Beckett was the card bible, and eBay didn't exist, so it was a hunt to build sets. I could buy em all on eBay tomorrow, so I feel conflicted now, but will probably complete what 13yo me started in the next month. Sharing because I found childhood gold!",

          "text": "Catalogued my grandmother’s collection aka my inheritance - 1,936 Beanies 😵💫 Grams wasn’t messing around. She spent decades amassing this mega-collection of Beanie Babies, ranging from the ultra-rare to run-of-the-mill and everything in between. I never saw a single beanie baby in her home, I don’t know where she was storing them all those years, all I know is that a few years ago I inherited a room-full of plastic bins containing about 2000 (mostly) mint condition beans, and their fate was now intertwined with mine. Beanie Babies have never been a passion of mine, but knowing how much time and research - and money, omg - my grandmother invested into these, I felt I had to do my homework and figure out what I had on my hands here. It took a long time, but I catalogued, photographed, and re-binned each and every one of them and checked price guides and eBay sales to note general price ranges...I know that those aren’t always reliable but it gave me a general sense of what was rare vs common. After cataloguing, I’d say this collection is about 75% standard-issue beans (which I’ll split up into bulk sales and donations) and 20-25% mid-to-high value beans, including a number of authenticated rarities. I’m starting the long, slow process of selling these little bean-dudes (who I have to say, I’ve grown some affection for), but I haven’t gotten past the point of picking out an eBay account name (I went with There Will Be Beans, but BeanRunner2049 was really close). Actually creating all of the listings and managing shipments and everything seems completely overwhelming to me. Also, most of these are being stored at my parents’ place in Florida. I shipped a few hundred of them back to my apartment in California so I could start the process, but even moving through selling this first batch feels like a huge undertaking. We’ll see how it goes! Any recommendations or advice would be appreciated, but mostly I just felt like I needed to share this saga with some folks who might",

Especially from working at and being close to staff at card shops, I love the idea of supporting local shops, and I do so whenever I possibly can. I feel like FF needs some discussion. For... who knows? I feel like I had a fair bit of knowledge on what shops were getting product for a week ago, but that's all very subjective. I can say what any of the shops and online retailer were selling for, because we all know what they were selling for by and large. Today, I showed up at a Best Buy, 5 hours after they opened, and I got all product at MSRP. This included Collector's packs. I wanted to bring up that it's troubling to support my local shop, I need to pay basically 2x more, on an already premium marked up product.

Before we get any of the standard \"but...\" comments, this is for a specific set of people, if your not one of them, thats great I still hope you learn something. What You Will Need: 1. GB/GBC Pokemon Repro Cart (Haven't worked with gen 3 yet) The one your looking for usually has a 2017 on the back of the board (seen easiest on crystal) You'll know you have one if the game freezes and the music stops for more then 5 seconds when trying to save. 2. Soldering Iron and the skill to use it (Seriously burns suck) 3. Gameboy Cart Flasher (Tested this method with the GBX and \"Flash Boy\") 4. CR2025/CR1616 Batteries (Tabbed) (Tape and wire if you are working on gen 2, as the 2025 batteries are larger than the board tabs) 5. Rom of the game (Obtained however). What We're Doing: We are trying to remove as much \"jank\" from these as possible to make them more playable and accessible to anyone who either doesn't want to sell a kidney, wants to get a copy of green working, or just wants more copies to trade/hunt on. We will be soldering a battery to the board, and flashing the proper rom, so it will properly use the battery and SRAM (This will work with FRAM too, this is just not the guide for it.) Let's Do It! : 1. Solder the new battery to the board, (For Gen 2 you will need to solder wires and tape down your battery). 2. Clean the board, you never know how dirty the rom and ram chips can get, and pop it into your flasher. 3. Flash your game and test it, save the game and reset to see if it holds, if it did congrats you have a fully working game with much less jank and didn't have to sell a kidney. Questions I Expect To Hear (If this post stays up): 1. Why not just use FRAM? You can I prefer the authentic feel of the original gen 1/2 games with the time limits of the batteries, and have the tools to replace them. If you would prefer FRAM, follow a guide on youtube as your not alone, and people have done it before. 2. How do I m",

It’s called TCG Scanner — a simple web app where you can upload a photo of your cards (even a whole binder page), and it’ll: Identify each card using AI Show current prices from Cardmarket and TCGPlayer. Known issues: * Still has trouble matching some cards to the correct one, will have to tinker arround a bit more * Prices are not retrieved live and based on last data ingestion (date is shown on results) Further plans / improvements : * Leverage Ebay api for pricing * Train model to detect slabs and find pricing based on that * Allow editing incorrect detections / matches * Add the option for people to send in images that have false detections to further improve training of AI Model If you want to try it out, feel free: [https://tcgscanner.tech/](https://tcgscanner.tech/) Still improving things, so feedback, ideas, or bug reports are always welcome. Thanks, and happy collecting.",

I ended up selling a bunch of stuff for only a dollar well under market value, unfortunately. I was wondering if anyone had any tips for getting into it. I also don’t really understand how the profit works considering I only got about $.45 for every dollar sale. Honestly, pretty bummed and deflated. I lost a lot of cool cards for very cheap and I’m not feeling very enthusiastic about this anymore. EDIT: I want to do some wheel spins I have single cards full packs and a few nice chase products... any advice on how to set up the wheel spin or anything?",

          "text": "Who’s in the wrong here? (Card show drama) I was at the Dallas card show last weekend, and on the last day, I spotted a card I really wanted for my personal collection. Before I made an offer, I overheard the vendor telling a friend that he hadn’t sold much at all he’d mostly been buying and he was complaining about there being too many flippers and not enough true collectors at the show. The card itself wasn’t super expensive, but it was an RPA of a player most people have forgotten, and I love collecting him. These cards rarely pop up, so despite the vendor being about $130 over the last comp, I still agreed to pay his price. I even offered him a trade, where I’d give him a much more liquid (and more valuable) card in exchange for his, but he valued my card at only half of what it was worth while he was still charging about 75% over comps for his own. Ultimately, I just decided to pay cash outright. We shook hands, and as I started counting out the money, he said, “You know what, seeing how much you want this card, I think I should just keep it.” I was in disbelief. I even tried to pay his full sticker price, which was $15 higher than our agreed amount, but he still refused to sell it. As I was walking away, I said, “I guess that’s why your case is still full.” He got really upset and accused me of taking a cheap shot as I left. I told him he was just being fragile, and he fired back that I was mad I didn’t get my way. I pointed out that we had a deal how was I not getting my way when we’d already agreed on a price? Things got a bit heated, but we ended up just going our separate ways. I just don’t know why you set up at a card show and someone’s offering you way more than you would get on eBay after fees and you still won’t sell a card no one wanted all weekend. Then get mad when someone points out your behavior as a reason as to why you haven’t sold anything. I think the guy needed a wakeup call. I don’t regret anything I said.",

          "text": "Anyone wanting to sell on ebay, please read this With how fast our hobby is growing, this needs to be discussed. Ive had this happen too many times now and i had to make this post to get it off my chest. I just had the 102/108 mega blastoise from evolutions i purchased on ebay come in bent to sh**, totally ruined and creased. No top loader or cardboard used in packaging. Ive been looking for a clean copy of this card for weeks now and this one looked great, ZERO whitening on the back edges or corners. What a shame. This particular seller has over 900 items sold and 99% feedback so even some experienced sellers slip up. Ive been selling cards on ebay for a couple years now and wanted to give some tips for anyone wanting to sell cards online. I feel its really necessary to sell some cards, at least for me, to be able to continue collecting. I remember being intimidated going into it so I hope i can help even just one person out there reading this. Here is what i do, and i know a lot of people have different methods that work as well. This is just what is easiest for me, and what i feel is easiest for the buyer when they have to unpackage it. #Step 1 - Put card in sleeve. Pretty simple, i would go get brand new sleeves if youre wanting to sell a decent amount.(You can get 100 sleeves for $1-2 at your lcs, target, etc)You want your buyers to feel like theyre opening something of quality even down to the sleeve. Old/used sleeves dont look good and can have little specks in it that can actually damage the card in transit, especially in envelopes. The envelopes are run through usps machines that are very thin and can press the card down against any particles and leave damage on the card. #Step 2 - Put card in toploader. Top loaders can be found almost anywhere that sells trading cards. You want the thinnest top loaders possible for pokemon, which is 35 pt. I personally get 100 for $11 online. I also have some 55pt and 100 pt for card lots. Again, i prefer to use brand new ",

          "text": "BLASTERS ARE BAD THIS YEAR?! INCREASED PRICES, LITTLE YIELD. Hey everybody, welcome back to another brand new release preview video. Today we're taking a look at the last boxes. We already covered the jumbo boxes and the hobby boxes and they were pretty good. Can't say that there's much of a anything to talk about negatively about them except the fact that the jumbo boxes got rid of one of your hits. Hobby box have been great. Now we're looking at blasters and I'm not so sure before I even rip any of these how I feel about these blasters. First of all, they went up in price. You don't realize it, but they went up in price. Let's talk about how. Boxes from 2025, they were $25 a piece. Boxes from 2026 are also $25 a piece. Except the big difference here is used to get 84 cards in last year's blaster boxes. Now you only get 72. So, they have taken a pack out. A complete pack is gone. Instead of seven packs per box at 12 cards each, you now get six. So, what does that mean for your price? Well, I do the math. Last year, you got 84 cards at $24.99. That's 29.75 cents a card. This year, the price is still the same for the box, but at 72 cards, you're paying 34.7 cents per card, which is the equivalent of paying the price of $29.15 per box. All you do is take that 34.7, multiply it by 84 cards, and that's what you know, that's what the price increase is gone to. So, basically, it's almost like buying the S last year's box for 29 bucks. So, big price increase on these blasters by $4 to $5. And are they going to be worth it? Well, I don't know. We'll go ahead and check it out right now because you've seen these out at Walmart. You've seen them at Target. You've seen them out there. And you might wonder, should I spend some money on this? Should I maybe buy like, I don't know, four blasters, or should I go buy a hobby box? Let's find out. We're going to open up 10 of these blasters in this video. We're going to start with this one right here. This is for Keith. Good luck, Kei",

And a lot of collectors feel uneasy without knowing why. This episode is not about what to buy next. It is about how to think while something big shifts around you. Panini to Topps. Fanatics stepping in. New marketing. New noise. Same collector sitting at home asking one quiet question. What does this mean for the way I collect? We talk mindset. Identity. Anxiety. Hype cycles. First year and last year traps. Why urgency feels loud right now. And how to slow down without falling behind.

Before we rush into what comes next, this episode slows things down and looks back at the Panini era. Not to praise it. Not to tear it down. To understand it. Panini did more than release products. It reshaped how collecting looks, feels, and moves. From Prizm changing modern card design, to product ladders, chase mechanics, and a release calendar that never stopped, this era trained collectors in ways many of us did not notice in real time. This episode breaks down what actually happened during the Panini run. How the hobby expanded. How attention replaced intention. How rarity, desire, and visibility became tangled. And why understanding this era gives you more control as we head into the next one.

Adam and Ryan are joined by Brett for a wide-ranging conversation that sits right at the intersection of wrestling storytelling and wrestling cards. Sami Zayn. AJ Styles. Logan Paul. Bron Breakker. Bianca Belair. Liv Morgan. If it matters this weekend, it’s on the table. They break down Royal Rumble predictions, surprise entrants, and what major story beats mean for the card market right now. From Black Finite Prizm cards to Cactus Jack Chrome, from Panini nostalgia to what Topps is doing next, this episode looks at how collectors react when moments, scarcity, and emotion collide. They also dig into how collectors actually buy today. eBay. Private deals. Group chats. Facebook. Even digital repacks. What works. What doesn’t. And why relationships still matter more than any platform. If you collect wrestling cards with intention, this episode will feel familiar. If you don’t, it might change how you look at the hobby.

          "text": "my subreddits TL;DR I ordered what I thought were original postcards but received modern reprints on post card stock. Should I give positive feedback or neutral? First things first, I didn't read the listing properly to understand that the seller was selling scans of postcards printed on modern post card stock and shipped from a 3rd party supplier. The seller had in their description things like high resolution licensed print and all postcards digital printed on postcard cardboard. They don't explicitly say that the post cards are not original despite the fact they have received negative feedback on the issue. So yeah, I missed all of that and normally I'd say that I messed up and give the normal positive feedback. Here is why I'm considering neutral feedback despite my mistake not reading the listing all the way. I assumed that the seller was just cutting and pasting the same description since they list 1000s of post cards so the description rarely gives any meaningful information. With post cards, the photo/scan of the post card is everything that really matters. I have been buying a number of post cards recently on a similar subject and these cards were priced similarly to the others I've purchased that are 75 to 100+ years old. Maybe slightly cheaper than I would expect but not by much. The post cards themselves are also not quite the same as the photo on the listings, mainly the text that identifies the image was shown on the listing photo but not printed on the actual postcard. Most postcards have text identifying the subject but these do not. The postcard looks good and the image is as good as can be expected of a scanned and reprinted old postcard. I just don't like the idea of giving positive feedback to someone who basically has a bunch of postcard scans then orders them to be printed on demand and shipped to the buyer by a photo lab. I'm sure I am just overthinking all this and just looking for confirmation that I should just do the positive feedback and ",

Here is what I think. The buyer lost the case on eBay but then filed a chargeback with their institution. However, his account says \"No longer a registered user.\" Either he got banned or just deleted his account. The funds are stuck with eBay and is ready to be released to either side. Question is: what do I provide for eBay? I already have QR code scan saying it has been picked up. Order number matches as well as order ID. Exact price that he bought it for (including fees) just to match his transaction history for the card he used. I can only provide 5 photos and I am need of dire help.

It has improved greatly since then, however I still only make on average 7-8 sales per week. Which is way better than getting none, but when it’s only $3-$10 pokemon cards that are selling, you aren’t really making enough. I do sell other items too, but nothing else has really sold for the past month other than Pokemon cards so I stick with that for the most part. I mostly use variation type listings for my cards and I promote them all at 3%. I also scan my cards instead of taking photos of the cards themselves as that will take too much time. Most of the sales I get I noticed always have someone messaging for extra pics. It gets annoying honestly and I’m tempted to just put in my listings that if you ask for extra photos i won’t respond, but I’m afraid to do that since people asked that on all my card sales so far. I also put them on store categories so people can easily search for stuff in my profile if they go on it. I feel with all of this that I’m doing everything right, but it’s just still way too slow and I’m not selling enough. Is there something I’m missing or doing wrong?",
