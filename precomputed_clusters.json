The seller has refused to send out the full set, claiming they put the bid up wrong and I was only bidding for 1 card instead of the full set. They have sent the 1 card out and on **economy untracked!** I am fuming. I think they were upset they had no bids on their item and I got it for a good price.

They have been stored in plastic bins in my basement for decades, so in ideal conditions. I clearly state in my listings that obviously fragrances can degrade and change over time, but my method of storage is designed to minimize this. I have been selling for over 20 years and have had thousands of sales. I do not accept returns and have never had a problem. Perfect feedback. Today I got a return request from someone who bought a vintage perfume “by mistake”. I asked if the original seal had been broken, because if not, then cool I could still list as NIB. Well of course the buyer (new account, zero feedback!) has sprayed it and says it doesn’t smell right and wants to return it. I know I will probably be forced to accept this request. How much can I withhold as a restocking charge? This is no longer valuable. I can’t sell it on eBay because opened bottles of perfume are \\*verboten\\*. I’m fuming. Any advice? Thanks!",

That same store does Facebook auctions and I have gotten a few good items on there to make a decent flip. I would like to know something more consistent. Whats everyone’s go to? Liquidation pallets? Return pallets? Wholesale? I have plenty of room for storage. Where are these guys on selling platforms getting all the name brand Jordans, coach bags, etc for such a good deal that the are comfortable selling them on 5 second sudden death auctions? I don’t mind getting a business license if that would give me more access to buy wholesale. I just have no clue where to start.

I have put this off because its not sustainable, people want to buy something for nothing, and it counts as income for Public Assistance, so it ultimately undermines my entire Public Assistance package. I'm trying to remember what I have and what I'm willing to let go in this first round. The stuff I have, I may have spent thousands of dollars on, but for selling its worth hundreds at most. In the mean time, I started shifting things over to my credit card as I'm trying to avoid paying my CPA with a credit card as that transaction will count as a cash advance, and I have 0% APR until September. I know it's a bad decision and I already have a balance, but I gotta float myself as long as possible in hopes I can find a job myself or the organizations that I am working with can help me find a job.

I did not accept the refund, but I did accept a return. Once I got the card, I made the shocking discovery that I had been scammed. This card is obviously a counterfeit.

          "text": "Never sell luxury items on eBay I’ve been selling on eBay for years, and for the most part, my experience has been fine. I’ve sold tons of low-priced items with little to no issue. But recently, when trying to sell a few luxury pieces, I had this feeling eBay never protect their sellers. I sold a Louis Vuitton bucket hat ealier this year. Without any communication at all, the buyer directly filed a dispute through their bank, not even through eBay, not even talked to me. There was no message, no reason, no return, just a chargeback. eBay said they would “fight for my rights as a seller, and talked to the bank” but after 3 months of waiting, 3 MONTH! I lost both the money and the item. No explanation, no follow-up, nothing. There’s absolutely no real seller protection when the buyer goes through their bank instead of eBay. The second time, I sold a Balenciaga hat (with the original receipt from the store). The buyer insisted it was fake because it didn’t look identical to another Balenciaga product he owned, which is absurd, since even within the same brand, manufacturing differences are normal. I accepted the return request just to resolve it peacefully. But then the buyer left me a huge negative review, all caps shouting “FAKE” in his review, extremely rude and completely baseless. EBay refused to remove this feedback, even though I had proof of authenticity and accepted the return. And of course, sellers aren’t allowed to leave any kind of negative review for buyers, so we just have to take it. I’ve learned my lesson. EBay is not a safe place to sell luxury items. There’s zero protection for sellers dealing with high-value goods. Buyers can make false claims, file chargebacks, and eBay will just shrug and say “we tried.” If you ever plan to sell anything designer or pricey, don’t use eBay. It’s not worth the stress or the loss.",

Even though I’ve been a loyal eBay member for 13+ years, I was left completely unprotected until PayPal finally stepped in. In August purchased a necklace on **eBay Germany** listed in the *Fine Jewellery (Echtschmuck)* category as **750 (18k) gold**. The chain itself was hallmarked “750,” which by law means 18 karat. However, when I received it, I did the responsible thing: I had it **professionally tested** by a jeweller — and it turned out to be *fake*. Not 18k, not even close. A counterfeit with an illegal hallmark. * In **Germany (Feingehaltsgesetz)** and the EU, falsely hallmarked gold is **illegal**. * eBay’s own Jewellery Policy states: “Gold, silver, and platinum items must meet applicable laws for stamping.” When I reported the issue and filed a case, eBay: 1. **Initially told me** I was protected under their *Money Back Guarantee*, and that the seller had to provide a return label. 2. The seller ignored all messages and never sent a label. 3. eBay’s own staff confirmed several times that I would be refunded once the seller failed to act. But then came the absurd twist: eBay closed the case in the *seller’s favour* because I had **tested the item**. Mind you I had the piece tested at a local jewellery store using XRF, a non-destructive method. In other words: * If I **don’t test** it, I can’t prove it’s fake. * If I **do test** it (responsibly and legally), using non-destructive method, I “void” my protection. A complete *Catch-22*. After denying my refund, eBay quietly **removed the seller’s account** — “no longer a registered member.” Usually sellers who want to close their account must wait at the minimum 6 months from their last transaction. Therefore, the fact that this seller being de-platformed",

I know it’s real because my mom bought these cards back in 1999 and we’ve had them ever since. The buyer messaged me saying he peeled the top layer off and that meant it was fake, but then left negative feedback saying the card “showed up peeling.” His own words don’t even match what he posted. He also told me if I just refunded his money he wouldn’t leave negative feedback. When I told him I wouldn’t refund until the card was returned since he admitted to damaging it, he left the negative review anyway and still hasn’t sent the card back. After I pushed back, he sent another message saying he tried peeling an old Poliwag from the 90s and “couldn’t peel it with pliers” so that proves mine is fake. I’ve reported him to eBay for feedback extortion but I haven’t heard back yet. My questions: has anyone else dealt with a buyer peeling apart a WOTC holo and then claiming it’s counterfeit? Do authentic holos peel like this if someone forces it? Ive attached photos from my eBay listing, the pics he sent along with the messages.",

I shipped out maybe a month ago $250 worth of Pokemon cards to a buyer (who has very high ratings, trusted buyer) and they reached out about not receiving their package. So I did everything I could in my power to contact USPS and also contact EBAY. We all know how impossible both of these can be to work with as EBay is unresponsive and won’t even let you talk to them and USPS’ website is ancient doesn’t work half the time and I don’t think they will help me if the package officially says ‘delivered’ in their system. So even with insurance on the package, I don’t think I can get my money back from USPS. If I’m wrong about that point me in the right direction. I told the buyer to mark the item as ‘not received’ because EBay would not let me contact them or make any changes until a case was made. Which gave me 3 days to update tracking/talk to my buyer, which I did. The tracking on USPS’ official site says delivered and shows all of the tracking updates. eBay did not show all the tracking updates and just says ‘out to delivery to authenticator’. I don’t even know what an authenticator is or is needed for considering the cards are graded, and I’ve sold a 1k card and did not have this stupid process go on. Me and my buyer are extremely confused and feel like eBay just snapped up our extremely expensive purchase and is preventing us from working with them. I don’t know if somehow USPS is wrong when I feel their tracking is usually reliable, so I’m favored to believe EBay is messing something up on their end. They emailed me today that they sided with the buyer (clearly didn’t read anything about our case) and issued a full refund. Now I’m screwed out of my childhood cards and the cash I really needed. What the hell do I do. Update 1: Now I’ve received an over $40 charge to my bank account because that’s how much eBay decided to overcharge my b",

The supply chain FOMO of 2020 and 2021 was just setting in when a video on Youtube got me psyched about building a cardboard empire. The guy was wearing a green visor, standing in front of a wipe board and talking about box prices going to the moon. I had done pretty well in the 90s buying sealed boxes of ice age, alliances and mirage cracking packs and selling singles to pay for the hobby. It seemed like sealed was the way to go. My optimistic and incredibly naïve plan: Buy a case of each set, wait the 5 years for it to double, sell half the case and have a free sealed collection. My goal was to spend about $2K per year on draft plus some extraneous stuff like commander decks and bundles, then after 5 years have about $10,000 invested worth $20,000. At the 2x mark I wanted to start selling to achieve a $10,000 set of sealed products for free. 5 years later did it work? Well sort of... Here are some things that have changed: · Specialty sets that cost 2x-3.5x a normal set (I’m looking at you commander masters) · Regular sets skyrocketing in price 50% from $80 to $130 a box · The pace of sets – No more 3x 1 case per year. · The amount of different product lines – collector, set, draft, play, commander decks etc · Universes beyond Needless to say, the idea of just spreading a little bit of money out and waiting became almost infinitely harder. MTG added set and collector boosters? Unsure of which to buy, I bought a case of each. Double masters came out and VIP boxes were $80-90, with draft at $300. I bought some cases o",

          "text": "My nephew stole my Pokémon Cards Recently I've finished my collection of every prime Pokémon card and have been working on my illustration rate collection from SV base- Surging sparks. Both collections have sat in binders in the corner of my room untouched for a month or so. 2 nights ago I decided to admire my prime collection that I worked hard going through eBay auctions and going to multiple card shops trying to collect every card. Upon opening the binder I noticed the center piece (Meganium Prime) was missing . I panicked wondering if it fell or if it slid behind one of my other cards but it was gone . Decided to look through my other binders I had stacked and of course my ceruledge IR , tapu bulu IR and eevee IR promo we're missing aswell. Checked my wifes binder to see if she had cards missing and of course some of her Raikous that she's been collecting have been taken specifically her amazing rare raikou that started her collection. We were heart broken but then it dawned on us that my 11 year old nephew has been secretly coming down stairs in our living space when we leave to go to work . We caught him once cause he thought we weren't home but my wife was there . After telling his mother the situation what exactly was missing and how much the cards were worth she told me he had admitted to them being taken and that he had a handful of cards at school in his desk that belonged to me. I wish the story ended with him returning from school with all the cards he had stolen from us but unfortunately my sister returned home with a stack of cards found in their desk and not a single one of them belonged to me just a bunch of common and uncommon cards worth about 2 dollars. It hurts to know that these cards I spent my money , pulled with friends and had watched on auctions for days be traded away gone forever. I know I can always get them back but I'm so hurt that it even happened in the first place and just wanted to share what is happening and how I'm feeling with ",

Hello, I currently sell on eBay selling TCG cards, most of them only sell for a dollar, but I do have a couple of cards that are a couple of dollars or more that I send out with these envelopes. The problem is the tracking. With the limited tracking, my buyers end up getting upset when the envelope doesn’t arrive in the eBay expected timeframe. I assure them I’ve sent it out, but just in the last week eBay has settled 6 cases in the buyer favor claiming I never shipped it or provided a tracking number. This was about $50 in sales (not much, I know). The envelope doesn’t even come back as being processed, only the shipping number created, so they deny the PIP claims as well. Its not feasible to ask buyers to pay for USPS ground advantage when that’s typically more than the card worth, but I keep having to deal with the hassle of lost mail search and running around eBay support every time a buyer opens a case.",

After doing 10+ failed printing due to blurry label, I've finally figured it out at least on Mac. When you download the label, you need to re-export it to PDF but with Quartz Filter of \"Black & White\". * Download the label at 8.5 x 11. * Open the label in Preview. * File > Export * Format is PDF. Select Quartz Filter > Black & White. * And save. This will generate a bigger file size, around \\~120kB instead of the \\~87kB original download PDF from Mercari. I never have this problem with eBay Standard Envelope. I don't know why Mercari is being crap here. They could just easily give us a higher resolution shipping label.",

I spend 3 months acquiring cards to buy my first deck, now that deck is so out of meta, and would take me months to build another deck. Is this game even playable? EDIT: thanks for the kind (continuing) responses, this helped me stop spiraling and focus on going out and meeting some locals I am getting frustrated, I posted on the weekly thread for the 4th time, and honestly just crashing out a bit. I'm not rich, I live in Canada, I want a hobby that gets me to local events outside of my house. Everyone told me to look for cheap decks and build off those etc. Fine. I am in Canada. Now I chose teach because I like the character a lot and his crew, and at the time people said it might not be the best but it's servicable. Fine. \"shouldn't cost more than $20-40 to build entire deck.\". It took me months to actually acquire all the cards, and all the prices are wildly more expensive than what I expected. Where I am told a card is 0.12 cents in canada it's minimum 45, and often even 1.25 because every local store in Canada knows I have no other choice. So I end up spending like $100, which includes the starter deck, to build everything except the last 4 cards I needed which I ended up having to order from Ebay as a 4x and it cost almost $40 alone for those 4... now they've been shipping for over 2 weeks from the states. Finally almost here, want to go to local event. Trying my stuff on sim now for weeks and I have not won a single game in 50 games, I constantly get 1 turn from win and lose everytime. I am not that bad, I am a grown adult who can critically think, it feels unfair and no fun. I tried to build a green zoro deck at the same time and every single person told me its cheap and effective. Great. I got all the cards I needed for I'll admit relatively cheap. Then I needed 4x perona and 4xmihawk. Great. Everyone says they're like $2.50",

Instead of taking 10-15% (or more) of every sale like TCGPlayer, you pay a flat monthly rate and keep 100% of your profits. The goal is to even have free basic memberships for those with limited inventories or who just want to track their collection. **Why I Built This** I used to own an LGS and I've sold cards on WhatNot/TCGPlayer so I understand the overhead nightmare and how brutal those marketplace fees are when you're trying to run a sustainable business. I've also spent years buying, trading, and selling cards on Reddit and a variety of FB Groups... I know first hand how easy it is to get scammed, the headaches of verification, and the overall risks. The goal is to bridge that gap: offer the safety and tools of a professional marketplace without the fee structure that absolutely kills people trying to sell/trade. **What You're Currently Paying** (TCGPlayer fees) * $1,000/month in sales = $100-125 lost to fees * $5,000/month = $500-625 lost * $10,000/month = $850-1,025 lost * $25,000/month = $2,125-2,562 lost With a flat subscription, you keep all of it. **Core Features** *Inventory Management* * Bulk upload and management tools (CSV and popular export formats) * Automated pricing for singles and sealed products (TCGPlayer, CardSphere, CardKingdom, CardMarket, eBay data) * Condition-specific pricing rules and global discount controls * Location tracking (for stores with multiple storage locations) * Tagging system for custom organization * Real-time inventory sync across all sales channels *Selling Tools* * Private storefronts with custom branding * Auto-generated item descriptions * Buy list management for stores * Trading functionality * Verification tools for buyer/seller trust * Order management and fulfillment tracking * Integrated payment processing * In-store kiosks for brick-and-mortar shops * Square integration for inven",

As of this morning, I’ve sold $13,488 in the last 90 days. Of that total, a pretty large number of cards are $20 or less, and they ship with eBay standard envelope. I charge my buyers $1.89 to which I pay $1.32. The additional 57¢ covers my material and time. If you believe eBay, their standard envelope takes 3-5 business days to arrive. It also claims to have tracking so you can follow your order. So that’s what a lot of buyers expect. Now let’s talk about reality. On average, my ESE deliveries are talking about 10 days for most people. Some end up taking up to three weeks. Some don’t ever arrive. “Tracking” is a complete joke. It’s not scanned by USPS at any point. They work with some third party, and the only times they \\*might\\* get scanned are via a sorting machine at specific hubs. As well as being a pretty big seller, I’m also a buyer somewhat regularly. I just looked, and of the last 10 cards I bought with ESE, only four of them showed as delivered. The other six, per eBay’s “tracking” would be considered long lost at this point. If I was a miserable human, I could very easily claim they never arrived, and force the seller to refund me. Even though the card is 100% in my possession. Now let’s talk about the threat. I received this email from eBay this morning. (Sorry for having to copy/paste, I can’t add a screenshot) . . . . . . . . . “Dear Seller, We wanted to remind you that your seller performance has consistently fallen below our minimum standards in the United States. As a result, there’s now a risk that the selling limits will be lowered on your account, and in some cases, you may be permanently restricted from selling on eBay.

          "text": "Any tips for getting out of “3 days post delivery” payment jail. Hi all. I’ve been selling trading cards on eBay for 1.5 years. About a month in after “proving myself” I started getting paid within a day or two of the buyer’s purchase. I maintained top rated seller status until November when I had one transaction count as 7 different defects for and INR case. I battled with eBay to get those defects removed and did prevail, but in the meantime they forced me to wait until 3 days after delivery for payments. This is devastating to my business as someone who averages 1,000 transactions per month and relies on the cash flow. The majority of my sales are low value cards where I have no choice but to send via eBay standard envelope unless I want to lose money by paying for ground advantage. Many times those never actually get scanned as delivered so it becomes a 30 day wait for payment. I tried calling to get it fixed but the service reps were no help and kept stonewalling me. One of them even told me “we don’t just give immediate payouts to anyone. You have to prove you can ship on time.” My service metrics are all great: .11% defect rate, .3% late shipment rate, 100% tracking uploaded in time. Over 12k transactions in the last year. I do get INR cases filed pretty regularly but I always handle it without eBay getting involved at all (except for that one aforementioned sale). Do I stand a good chance at getting the payment status restored after the Jan 20th eval? Has anyone gone through this before and gotten out of it? Currently have nearly $20,000 being held hostage in my funds because of this draconian change.",

So Im not sure if I'm doing something wrong, if post office regulations changed, or some mix of both, but Ive started having a ton of issues from USPS sending my orders back and requiring more postage despite the fact Im using the prepaid ebay label. For context: I have been selling trading cards on ebay since 2016, and started using ebay's labels around 2019. Over the years, every now and then I would get an order sent back saying it required more postage, but since the overwhelming majority of orders shipped no problem I didnt think much of it, especially since my local post office clerks never indicated issues with my packaging. Well, I turned in almost 30 orders at my post office on Friday, and when I opened my mailbox this morning all of them had been shoved in a USPS bag and crammed into my mailbox with a note saying each one required an additional $0.49 to ship. It indicates they arent machinable but I dont understand why... they were packaged the same way I always package them and over 95% ship out no problem, not to mention I send cards through TCGplayer packaged almost same way but with a stamp and never have issues there either. The way I package them: Card goes into a toploader, toploader wrapped in a thin piece of newspaper essentially. Placed in a 7x4 envelope with the label fully taped to the envelope with packing tape. Usually weighs between .6 - .7 oz with a thickness of roughly 1/8\" Is there an issue with my process or were my orders just handled by a disgruntled employee? If there is an issue with my process, what is it and what do I need to do to fix it? Do I need a label maker? Cause I really dont want to have to buy a label maker. Thanks in advance!",

          "text": "Side Hustle – Passive Income via eBay Dropshipping I want to share a realistic breakdown of how I make money online through eBay dropshipping, specifically for those who need a side hustle This is not a “get rich quick” post, and it’s not recycled advice for experts, this is for beginners (which is where most people go wrong). What I do (in simple terms) eBay dropshipping means: • You list products on eBay • You do not hold inventory • When a customer buys, you purchase the item from Amazon and ship it directly to the buyer No warehouse. No bulk stock. No upfront inventory sitting on shelves. ⸻ Why this works • eBay already has 135M+ buyers searching daily • You don’t need ads, a website, or marketing skills • You leverage existing traffic, not create demand • Entry cost is low compared to most businesses This is why it’s one of the easiest online models to enter if done properly. ⸻ My results (context matters) • I currently operate 15 profitable eBay stores • Each store generates $1,000–$3,000/month • This is consistent income, not one-off wins • I also run an agency helping others do the same I’ll attach screenshots for transparency. ⸻ The part most people screw up (and get banned) Account warm-up. This is where 90% of beginners fail. I use a 4-day warm-up process: • 3 days before opening the store • 1 day after the store goes live Skipping this is why people get limited or suspended and then say “eBay dropshipping doesn’t work.” It does work — just not if you rush it like an idiot. ⸻ Costs & setup (real numbers) • eBay Store subscription: \\~$25/month • Listing limits: up to 250,000 items/month (varies per account) • No inventory costs upfront • No ad spend Limits increase over time as the account is handled properly. ⸻ Automation & scaling I use AI + automation software for: • Product research • Listing creation • Price monitoring • Order fulfillment • Stock checks I also use virtual credit cards to keep payments stable and accounts clean.

We sell Japanese / anime collectables I made a post just like this a year ago, here's a link to that post if you want to see the differences between 2024 and 2025. Also has some more context on what we do and what we sell: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our\\_2024\\_sales\\_statistics\\_as\\_fulltime\\_ebay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our_2024_sales_statistics_as_fulltime_ebay/) The quick rundown though is we (me and my girlfriend) are full-time online sellers who predominately sell Japanese collectables, of which we import directly from Japan. Mostly obscure, vintage, and rare bits rather than modern stuff you can find anywhere. Most of the time we have over 8000 active individual listings on eBay. Notable statistics: Net Sales: $190,465.79 Profit: $99,167.20 Transactions: 5367 Average ROI: 427.51% All of these number are a touch worse than 2024, but not by much. 2023, 2024, and 2025 all had very similar yearly totals which heavily implies we've reached the limit of what we can make with our current system / setup. This year was interesting, particularly due to tons of changes due to our current... administration. Tariffs were a problem for us, because being Japanese collectable sellers 99% of our inventory comes imported straight from Japan. You'd think it's just a 15% increase in buy costs, because that's what the tariffs are, but it's worse than that. Tons of shipping methods skyrocketed in prices, and many international shipping providers pulled out of shipping to the US entirely. UPS and FedEx both hit you with tons of additional fees alongside the 15% tariffs, often times as \"brokerage fees\". I could go into it but the short of it is... screw UPS specifically. So many issues this year. As well, a lot of panic in the early months of year caused a notable dip in our sales. February was the lowest month we had in years, a s",

Whether or not they actually did receive it, I do not know because USPS isn’t consistent on scanning and updating the tracking if shipped via eBay envelope (value under $20). In these instances is there any way to not be forced by eBay to refund the purchaser since I did ship it based on eBay’s tracking? Moving forward do I just need to increase my shipping costs so there is a USPS tracking label on every purchase no matter the cost for the card itself? Meaning the shipping would then be about $6.",

Now, i’m looking for an Ohtani Auto but they are all over $2500 and no one is willing to sell outside the US. I’ve messaged many sellers without success. I understand the potential problems for the sellers in this case. My preffered shipping method would be DHL insured for full value as i don’t want to skip customs in, i just want the card to arrive safely. :) Card shows are not an option as they are very scarce in the EU and sportscards for US sports are even harder to get (mostly Pokemon and other gaming cards). And other auction sites like Goldin or Heritage just don’t offer a variety of cards like eBay and tend to only offer even more expensive cards. Does anybody have suggestion how to work the problem or how to communicate with a seller to make an exception? I also would like to add that i still would like to use eBay just for safety reasons. Thanks!",

Is there anything I can do to stop this return? I messaged the buyer through the return request page and they didn’t reply at all after three messages. I opened a case after waiting the required amount of time and minutes later I get a email that says: *“We asked the buyer to return the item for a refund. When tracking details show that the item is delivered, we'll issue a refund to the buyer on your behalf. This case will not affect your seller performance.”* I was very clear that I was NOT accepting the return in the case I opened because the buyer already took apart the device AND SENT IMAGES OF IT OPENED IN THEIR RETURN REQUEST!!! and my listing was overly detailed and what the buyer claimed is not as described is very much in the listing Second of all what the F- you mean eBay is issuing the buyer a refund ON MY BEHALF once it’s delivered. How is this even legal for them to automatically give the money back without giving me a chance to inspect they put the device back together properly!?!? Edit: I may add it’s been 3 days since eBay made their case decision but the buyer hasn’t shipped it back. Is there a time threshold where the case automatically closes? Update: Got the camera back and no matter how many times I tell them that the camera has been opened and that I can’t possibly give them a full refund, they don’t care. Absolutely ridiculous AND they kept the 500$ selling fee so now not only do I have to give back the 2500$ payout but I need to somehow come up with 500$ to pay eBay or else they send it to collections.

After years of collecting and trading at events across the US, we kept encountering the same problems every serious collector faces. Tracking our collection values was a mess of spreadsheets. Organizing potential trades meant juggling eBay sold listings, price guides, and scattered notes. And we never really knew our portfolio's true performance over time. **Sound familiar?** So we built CardNexus - a modern portfolio tracker designed specifically for collectors who actually care about the value and organization of their collections. **What we've built so far:** * 🆓 A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch) * 💸 Real-time price syncing across multiple marketplaces * 📊 Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early * 🗂️ Custom lists for trading, selling, or just organizing your collection * 🌍 Multi-category support: TCGs (Magic, Pokémon, Lorcana) and soon sports cards **This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on collector feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 8 weeks ago with the TCG community, but we're expanding to serve the broader collecting world. Today, we're opening 200 beta spots for r/collectors !

The item was fully operational, sold through the international program. After shipping I get an item not received 2 weeks later. eBay received it and shipped to customer but it was still en route. 2 days later customer opens a return. I don’t know the reason for the return since eBay is handling it. When I click on details it only says eBay is handling it. Part of me thinks the customer opened the return before receiving since there were shipping delays. eBay will end up paying the customer back the $300, not me. Is it possible this return has throttled my sells or is it just a coincidence. It’s strange they coincided with one another and I just can’t see any other reason. Anyone experience something similar.

For months, I've had this nagging feeling that I was working my tail off for profits that just didn't seem to add up. I got fed up with the guesswork, so I ran an experiment. I took a batch of 50 mid-value hockey cards and decided to track *everything*. What I found was grim, but it provides some clarity on why so many of us feel like we're on a hamster wheel. **Part 1: The Time Sink is Real.** Just tracking the raw time to get 50 cards from a sorted box to \"sold and shipped\": * Photography: 2.1 hours * Research & Pricing: 2.5 hours * Listing Creation: 3.3 hours * Packaging & Shipping: 2.9 hours * **Total: Nearly 11 hours of actual work.** That's over 13 minutes of pure labor per card. By day three, I was so burned out on the operational grind I couldn't even look at another card. **Part 2: What I actually paid in fees was 17.6%** This is the part that should make you angry. I took one of my better sales—a **$35 card** where the buyer paid **$5 shipping**—and broke down every single cost: * Started with **$40 gross revenue**. * eBay's Final Value Fee: **-$5.67** (They charge 13.25% on the TOTAL including shipping and tax, which is how the number gets so inflated). * Per-Order Fixed Fee: -$0.30 * Promoted Listing Fee: -$1.07 (Basically mandatory to get seen). * Actual Shipping Cost: -$5.00 * Packaging Materials: -$0.75 After all that, I had **$27.21 left from my \"$35 sale.\"** The advertised 13.25% fee is total BS. My **True Effective Fee Rate** on the revenue I received was **17.6%**. Nearly one in five dollars vanished into a black box of fees. I'm laying this all out because I'm tired of guessing. I'm working on a better way to handle all this, but I wanted to share the raw numbers first. I'm curious if this matches what other high-volume sellers are seeing. How are you guys tracking this st",

Figured I either get a good deal, or worst case get my money back. I buy the item. Tracking provided. All good. Except for tracking it said 2 items were in transit. That raised an alarm as only one item was bought. Anyways item finally “arrives, except it didn’t. I live in a house, and tracking says delivered at front desk. I knew right then and there it was too good to be true. I contact eBay for a refund. They deny it. I appeal it, they deny it again saying seller provided proper documentation... Finally I call eBay and get a hold of an awesome lady who said she has seen this more and more and sellers price stuff under $750, because no signature or picture is required for drop off. I then had to sign a declaration stating I never got this and lying could result in perjury charges... but I finally got my money back. What a nightmare though.",

          "text": "How I failed my first 3 months in eBay dropshipping (and then turned it around) When I started eBay dropshipping, I wasted a good 3 months doing it completely wrong. I was trying to find the perfect products, spending way too much time researching items, analyzing competition, trying to reverse engineer what other sellers were doing. I maybe had like 50 listings up and I was getting like 1 sale every 3 weeks. Looking back, I realize I was just overcomplicating everything. The turning point for me was when I stopped looking for “winning items” and just focused on volume. Instead of guessing what would sell, I started listing as many items as possible every single day. I use Amazon as my supplier and list the same products on eBay with about a 100 to 105 percent markup. Once I shifted into that mindset, things started to move fast. I went from barely any sales to getting multiple sales per day. And now I’ve got over 10,000 active listings and I’m consistently doing between $1,000 and $3,000 in profit each month. No ads, no complicated setup. Just raw volume. Most people underestimate how powerful that impulse buyer behavior is on eBay. People just scroll, see something they like, and buy it. They’re not checking if it’s cheaper on Amazon or thinking too hard. They just hit buy now. So if you have enough listings live, you’ll naturally catch those eyeballs. I usually list about 100 new items per day. It sounds like a lot but once you get into a rhythm it becomes second nature. I also optimize titles so the listings show up in search, but I keep it super simple. The main mistake I see people make is thinking you need to be clever or find secret products. You don’t. You just need to play the numbers game. That’s what finally worked for me.",

I'm not rich, I live in Canada, I want a hobby that gets me to local events outside of my house. Everyone told me to look for cheap decks and build off those etc. Fine. I am in Canada. Now I chose teach because I like the character a lot and his crew, and at the time people said it might not be the best but it's servicable. Fine. \"shouldn't cost more than $20-40 to build entire deck.\". It took me months to actually acquire all the cards, and all the prices are wildly more expensive than what I expected. Where I am told a card is 0.12 cents in canada it's minimum 45, and often even 1.25 because every local store in Canada knows I have no other choice. So I end up spending like $100, which includes the starter deck, to build everything except the last 4 cards I needed which I ended up having to order from Ebay as a 4x and it cost almost $40 alone for those 4... now they've been shipping for over 2 weeks from the states. Finally almost here, want to go to local event. Trying my stuff on sim now for weeks and I have not won a single game in 50 games, I constantly get 1 turn from win and lose everytime. I am not that bad, I am a grown adult who can critically think, it feels unfair and no fun. I tried to build a green zoro deck at the same time and every single person told me its cheap and effective. Great. I got all the cards I needed for I'll admit relatively cheap. Then I needed 4x perona and 4xmihawk. Great. Everyone says they're like $2.50 each so another $20 isn't SO bad. Wrong. I can't get a Perona card now for under $12.00 for ONE CARD, same with Mihawk. I am looking at $100 for 8 cards, in Canada, to finishin a deck of which I have 43 cards for already. I constantly ask for help to see if I can replace those cards with others, n",

Because I eventually want to move to higher ticket items, it's completely reasonable to expect inventory movement to slow down as a result.

Do I just do what some people do and price it at some arbitrary high price, then gradually lower the price to get more views and eventually a bite? Or, and I haven't seen this suggested anywhere, do I try having it appraised by some professional? From a quick google search, this can range from $50 to $500, which ultimately poses a risk, since, after appraisal, I might already be at a loss, since I now have to account for the appraisal cost when I list the item.

The buyer asked me to hurry up and ship it and I offered to rip them and just send him the codes and he said no. Now I'm nervous because if he claims they do not work, I have zero recourse. Should I rip off the cards and take a picture of the codes? That way at least Microsoft could possibly track if and when the code has been used? Should I just text him the codes even though he said to ship them? Or should I just ship them and hope for the best?",

Sensation Comics, the original run for Wonder Woman, made some issues that dropped Wonder Woman to focus on the monsters and mystical setting. (Sensation Comics #107-109, Sensation Mystery #110-116) I think they'd look good next to Action and Adventure comics. However, these are ridiculously overpriced on ebay and such.

I pointed out every detail that you can easily identify. They need to have a department that looks into claims better. I also see a ton of sellers selling fake silver and gold even us currency.

Where would be the best reliable place to bulk buy a bunch of cards that are common? I like the idea of making my own decks, and while I do plan on buying some precons, I would love the ability to just search through a collection and make something. I assume I could just go on maybe ebay or something for them (ngl I've never used ebay so I'm unsure if this is reliable). I do have some shops near me, but when I went they seem to just have binders which was nice for picking out a few cool cards. I just want a bunch of good common cards that should be in most decks! edit: sorry I think I used the wrong flair, I do not post often on reddit 😬",

I tried selling this card on multiple platforms like whatnot, ebay, fb marketplace but no one seems to want this and they prefer English cards. Its a bummer because I was planning to use any money I got to go towards buying another booster box and since its from the new OP-14 set i expected more people to want it. Does anyone know where I could sell this? What type of platforms may be interested and stuff like that, any insight would help, thank you! Good luck on your pulls! :)",

The price on eBay for collection and drop off is the same price, £2.75. For months I've booking one collection, and handing over any extras to be scanned which were bought as drop off (again same price) so as not to have to have extra collections booked when they're already booked to collect. I also pack a lot of orders late at night, meaning that if I did book collections for the extra orders that come through late at night, they'd have to then be collected the day after the original collection day. I asked my usual postie if its okay to book one collection and hand over the extras to be scanned when he comes to collect in the morning, and he said it was fine. Done this for months. Today a different employee came to collect (they had manager written on their uniform), and stated that each collection costs 30p per parcel (which is the case if booked direct via RM), and they would \"let me off for today\". Am I in the wrong? For eBay this doesn't make any sense to me, being as the price of drop off and collection is the exact same. Happy to be corrected!",

To those who tried rage baiting or telling me it's a pointless post, might be pointless to you - but there's plenty of others who clearly wanted this to be said. Your rage bait attempts were also pathetic - gotta work a bit harder because unlike you rats, I have thick skin and can handle a bit of abuse without having a sook and reporting you to the admins. I've been speaking privately to Alex about this - and after our conversation, I can admit that my anger towards this group was misdirected towards him. The WTB post, now that I think about it clearly, had no reason to be in the original post - so I have now removed it. I guess I was just finding anything I could to put the admin team down, and I saw the listing (which was directly related to the origin of this post) and pulled the trigger. I won't speak to what he said to me - but I wanted to update you all on the fact that Alex has come to me and asked how he and the group can \\*help with this situation. There is a solution in the works - however reselling will never be banned. As much as I don't like the idea of them (scalpers) having a platform this big to sell on, I've done as much as I can and that's just the way it is. I want to thank Alex for fronting up to the comments below and my messages (I was fairly direct about his admin team's behaviour) as you copped the full front of everything instead of Rhys - the one who SHOULD be responding. \\*help - not completely resolve as the resolution we want is for reselling to be banned, and that's not going to happen. Rhys - after looking at all these comments and seeing all the people you've pissed off and how you've clearly chosen what people to defend in different situations, I think it's time for you to mak",

Location: Texas Hey everyone, recently I was talking with a guy on instagram about trading some of my pokemon cards for some of his sealed pokemon product, we agreed on the trade and I asked him to open it and just ship me the packs inside. He agreed and said I had to ship all my cards to him first and once he verified that received the stuff I sent was correct he would ship out his end of the trade. I was fine with that so I agreed but later my parents found out about the trade and made be block him on all platforms as they believed that he was going to scam me as I have been scammed like this before and the trade value was above $2000. He then messages me on my ebay store threatening me to unblock him or else there will be consequences so I block him again as I do not want to deal with someone who has to resort to threats. He then makes a new ebay account and messaged me today with screenshots that he messaged one of my friends on instagram about me and with screenshots of my linkedin profile threatening to call my job and the local police if I don't compensate him for opening his pokemon box. I offered him to pay him the difference in price of the box sealed vs opened but he only wants the full amount for the boxes which is $800 even though the packs inside are still sealed. My reasoning was that he shouldn't have opened the box in the first place as he didn't even recieve the cards that I would have sent him yet. Shouldn't he have confirmed that I sent him the correct stuff in the trade before opening his product since I was supposed to ship to him first anyway? He says he will file a police report by the end of the week and I do not know what to do please help.",

I've done some google searching, looked at the tariff documents, and just have no idea how to accurately estimate what the tariff would be on a single card coming from the EU. One answer I found indicates that I would pay less if the seller marks that the card is of USA origin on the form, but I'm not sure if that's true or if I could trust the seller to do that. The card is a great deal and something I've been hunting for a while, so I'm ok paying some amount of tariff I just want to make sure it's not something nuts like 70% or something. Any info would be greatly appreciated. Anybody out there buy a single from the EU recently?",

Now these are quadruple the price. All I want are my pretty, hand-made cards! Where are you getting yours? EDIT: Thanks, everyone, for the links to the Hallmark cards. I really appreciate it. I'm reframing my question to emphasize the \"homemade\" (AKA \"fancy\") cards like the Papyrus or Burgoyne cards with the 3d jewels and such.

As a collector who has been in the hobby for a year, I have learned quite a bit, but I still have much more learning to do. I’m sure the question above will help others like me who are slowly getting into the hobby. I have a local card shop in my area that has very reasonable prices for the sports that I collect, which is football (soccer), European basketball, and baseball. They do an amazing job of getting any hobby box that I request if they are able. This year I have been able to pick up topps finest, multiple topps chrome products, and really any baseball product I would like. I typically prefer to buy hobby boxes over blasters/retail and I am slowly getting into buying singles on EBay and at local card shows. I really enjoy being a wax ripping degenerate and I even protect a lot of my base cards even though I know boxes are -EV long term. There is one thing I have noticed, sometimes my LCS prices hobby boxes higher than what I can find online from retailers like Dave and Adam’s and Blowout Cards. For example, I want a box of 2024-25 Topps Chrome UEFA Club Competitions Soccer Hobby Box. My LCS is selling it for $225. Wax Stat has the average box price $239.95, and then there is another site that I saw a box for $200. Let me say this, I know that shops are really able to price their products however the hell they want and they probably get products at MSRP. My LCS is not budging on his price with me and I fear his 15 boxes will sit on the shelf for a long time. As a consumer, I’m a little bit of a penny pincher and I want to make sure I’m not overpaying for the same product. Is there any tips that long term collector can give me that will save me money long term? Side note, one thing that I have an issue with is breakers buying vast amounts of product which then inadvertently drives the price up. I have been able to get a box of Topps premier league for around $150 and snag two boxes, that pro",

I normally check prices before going so I can be ready to negotiate. Its easy to find single cards and slabs but I can't find what is the value of this sealed promo.

          "text": "Determining Signature Card Values Obviously price is what the market dictates, but seeing how this question is asked a hundred times as the cards get opened, thought id share my thoughts and would like yours. As of right now Lee Sin signed is marked as sold on Tcg $1,200. Then ive seen ebay listings in fb group of Ahri $400ish and Voli $700ish My personal opinion is a good amount would be 2x value of what we see from Chinese market (closest counterpart). Im basing this off of Pokémons Japanese to English comparison. Japan being english pokemons closest counterpart. Also to get a signed card is around 30 boxes or 720 packs. When compared to something like Pokemon chase card the Unbreon Vmax which is about 1/2000 packs. I dont know the math on specific signatures, it might be higher. That card at that rarity sat at $600-$800 for longest time before the scalper boom past year and half. Now people might say wait... theres 15 signature card types, so pulling a specific one is significantly harder, so value should be higher. But i argue that the difference in Pokemon comparison is theres no cards (except rayquaza) from that set that came even close to the price point. So until the characters popularity come into play, they should all be around the same value and highly tradable. Just something to consider. Seeing the chinese market i would say English signature should be around $400-$600. That being said we saw what leesin sold and people are asking $2k already. But in a month hundreds of signed cards will flood the market cutting that in half or more id imagine. What are your thoughts?",

I was ecstatic. kept that card for 20 years. I recently restarted collecting cards and noticed that everything changed. the price are out of this world, there are 200 different flavors you can buy. and they are all upper-deck. after some digging I came to pinpoint the culprit to be the diamond classification upper deck attributes to a dealer. this essencially killed the moms and pops card shop, now only huge stores remain where there is pressure to buy and where the kids can't afford sh1t all and are seen as a semi-nuisance. it got me somewhat angry.. I hated my experience, in fact I buy exclusively online now, I have not traded or sold a card since I restarted a few years back because there are no community, events or places where you can exchange about your passion, beside online forums with mostly trolls. kids cannot use ebay, or any of these trading apps. kids do not work, kids cannot generate 13$/day to buy a pack of cards. how the hell, is this hobby supposed to survive if it behaves like amateur radio boomers. the kids are left aside.. the future of the hobby is trampled on (and as a byproduct, the ",

          "text": "Most ‘I Buy Sports Cards’ Buyers Disappear When You Mention eBay Sold Prices 😅😭 I recently messaged about 20 local buyers who advertise that they purchase sports cards. I told them I have a large collection with many high value pieces. For several of them, I even sent photos of some of my better cards. Almost all of them asked whether I had cards of specific players (including rookies), and I said yes. In the end, I explained that my collection is very large I have cards from almost every sport and many players. I said if someone wants to buy in person, I’m willing to sell below market, roughly 70% of market value for most items, and I’d do my best to make a deal. I also said I would price based on recent eBay sold listings. As soon as I mentioned eBay sold comps, most of them lost interest. So I’m asking, do these people actually want to buy cards... or are they trying to pressure sellers into letting valuable collections go at unreasonably low prices? Unfortunately, scammers and predatory buyers are everywhere. Please be careful. My advice to fellow collectors _Don’t let strangers set your prices. Always check recent eBay sold listings (not asking prices) and use that as your baseline. _Know your range. If you need quick cash, decide your discount in advance (e.g., 70–85% of market depending on card/liquidity). Don’t let someone talk you down further on the spot. _Meet safely & in public if selling locally. _Be cautious with “I buy collections” posts. 🚨😅 Many of these buyers only want deep discounts far below comps. If someone refuses to use sold data, that’s a red flag. _Remember you have options. If you’re patient, you can sell online a little below market and still do better than a lowball local offer. Stay safe, do your own research, and protect the value of your collection",

My dad passed away about 4 years ago and left my sister and me millions of sports cards — mostly baseball but some other sports too. He had them valued at over $120k at one point and was really into eBay buying and selling. He had thousands of cards graded and kept a detailed price book, but we honestly can’t make sense of any of it. We don’t know how to spot the more valuable cards or where to even start. We’re also realistic that we’ll probably take a loss if we sell everything, but we don’t want to just give away something that might have value.

          "text": "How I turned a 400$ commercial zero turn to 2,000$ (my 4th mower flip) Picked up this 2007 Yazoo Kees Mid Max commercial zero turn mower after talking the seller down from $750 to $400. It wasn’t some blown-up, hopeless project, the motor already ran fine. The seller just couldn’t keep it mowing because it kept shredding belts (likely from improper routing). When I got it, the mower was dirty and unable to move under its own power. The motor itself ran strong, so I figured it was worth the gamble. I ended up replacing the drive belt and putting on a deck belt, swapped in a new ignition solenoid and 25A fuse (one-time issue I tracked down), added some fuel stabilizer/cleaner to flush out old gas gunk, and eventually had to put on new rear tires after puncturing one while mowing my own yard (previous where already tubed and dry rotted, but did hold air) Total labor was maybe 6 hours spread over a weekend. After cleaning it up and putting about 8 hours of mowing on it myself, I listed it and sold for $2,000 cash in just two weeks. The numbers worked out great: purchase price was $400, total parts and supplies were about $400, so I was all-in for $800. Sold for $2,000, which left me with a $1,200 profit. This was my fourth riding mower flip, and honestly the smoothest. And I’m nowhere near done so expect to see more from this page!",

[[Explore Top Rated larry walker rookie card on Amazon.]](https://blogs.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=larry walker rookie card) ## Key Features Analysis The larry walker rookie cards are available across several different brands and sets from the late 1980s,each with its own unique characteristics and collectibility. **1989 Donruss #33** The 1989 donruss card features a classic design of the era,with walker pictured in his montreal expos uniform. The card quality is typical of donruss from that period, which means there can be centering issues or soft corners sometimes. The card itself is relatively abundant, making it more affordable for many collectors. **1989 Fleer #548** The 1989 fleer card showcases walker in a batting stance. The fleer sets of the late 80s are known for their occasionally poor quality control, especially with print defects.This particular card, while common, can fetch a premium if it's well-centered and free from any markings or damage. **1989 Score #404** The 1989 score card presents walker in an action shot fielding a ball. This card is arguably the most readily available of walker's mainstream rookie",

          "text": "Micro SD Express Card Guide for Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of storage right out of the box. However, if you own/buy a lot of games and would like to upgrade to a higher capacity of storage, you'll need a **Micro SD Express card.** These are different from normal Micro SD, Micro SDHC, and Micro SDXC cards, denoted by the **EX** on the card. Normal Micro SD card speeds range from [2-312MB/s](https://www.kingston.com/en/blog/personal-storage/memory-card-speed-classes). However, to bring Nintendo Switch 2 somewhat closer in line with speeds that the SSDs that PS5 and Xbox Series consoles use, the system requires the use of high-speed \"Express\" memory. These speeds are upwards of 600-900MB/s. The good news is that your Nintendo Switch 2 games will load faster. Both the system and cartridges for Nintendo Switch 2 utilize the Express technology which have led to the high prices of these cards for publishers and the creation of the \"Game Key Card\" to avoid this extra cost. But overall, new games for the console will load much faster. The bad news: **your old Micro SD cards that you've been using for Nintendo Switch will** ***NOT*** **work on your Nintendo Switch 2 for storing game data**–inserting your current Micro SD card will only show your screenshots and videos, but you cannot play games off of them, be it Switch 1 or Switch 2 games. Micro SD Express cards are relatively new, but you can find some already on the market if you'd like to purchase one for Nintendo Switch 2. The small variation in the speeds of these cards are a miniscule difference and likely won't matter in everday gaming use. ***Note - be careful you buy an \"Express\" card, and not an \"Extreme\" card, as Extreme cards are not Express.*** Again, look for the \"EX\" on the card itself. If it has the EX logo, you're in the clear. **Micro SD Express cards in the US:** ***128GB EX*** · SanDisk - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-128GB-microSD-Express-SDSQXFN-128G-GN4NN/dp/B0DFQKQ9",

          "text": "(NOT A DEAL) An attempted guide at buying EVERY Scarlet & Violet set online at retail in 2025 Hey r/PokemonDealsUK ! Firstly, apologies for a post that's not really focused on a good deal. Please forgive me! As we all know, the hobby has grown in popularity significantly over the last few months which has been great to see. We've got more budding collectors and shiny cardboard enthusiasts than we've had for a fair few years in the UK now, but the consequence of this which we've all learned the hard way is that actually finding product to rip and good deals to save money is becoming increasingly difficult. Now over the last few weeks, I've experienced far too many people from brand new collectors to stressed parents complain in public, on this subreddit or over on r/PokemonTCG_UK about how they can't find stock for any set anywhere. So that's basically the inspiration for this post. I imagine most frustrations will understandably be aimed at Prismatic Evolutions, but I figured I'd create this post to highlight how you can buy any set from the Scarlet and Violet era of Pokemon cards. If this post can even help just one person out, then my work is done! Before getting into it, a few potentially pointless things to note: - If you'd like to try your luck in public, your priority stores are places like: Smyths, WHSmith, Waterstones, GAME and HMV. Supermarkets can be good too but stock has dried up a lot from my own personal experience. - I've not checked every single online store, so if you can find even better deals, that's great! - Extending on the above, I've not checked Amazon as their URLs are too long, same for eBay too. But a few sets have Booster Bundle Boxes available. - While the standard retail price of a single pack is £4.29 (not counting special sets), these prices differ for other sealed products like Blisters and Elite Trainer Boxes and the price per pack (PP) is higher. Just chucking this in to be safe. - For a couple of sets, it was basically impossible t",

So, I am moving to Japan at the start of April and need to liquidize as much of my stuff as possible as I no longer have a reliable storage option in the USA. I have about 2000 sports cards. I tried listing some on ebay but since I have a brand new account, I got no action. I have already spent hours separated my cards into these categories: * >$1.50 ungraded (only counting cards with recent sales and with some Mint 10 sales) * over >$1 (including over $1.50 without recent sales or mint 10s) * between $0.25 and $0.99 * worthless bulk I also further divided those 4 things weeding out HOFers and rookie cards. My top cards, imo: * 1986 Topps Jerry Rice rookie * 1986 Topps Bruce Smith rookie * autographed 1986 Topps Anthony Munoz * 1990 Fleer Michael Jordan * 1989 Hoops Michael Jordan * 1990 Skybox Michael Jordan * 2008 Upper Deck All-Star Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, CP3, Kevin Durant * 2x Mark Jackson cards with Menendez Brothers (but not sure if the value is still there for them) * 1962 Topps Willie Mays * 1989 Bowman Ken Griffey Jr (which sadly is in awful condition) * 1992 Fleer Jose Uribe with birthday error (which for some reason has obscene value) I will try going to some comic and card shops in the area to see if they will buy them. I don't know if there is any consignment shop in the area but I will ask around. Google doesn't think so. There is a big sports card convention in town the first weekend of April but I won't be here for it but maybe I can convice one of the vendors to buy my cards at a low value? I am hoping to get about 50% value for my top cards, $0.25 cents a card for my second tier cards, and maybe $0.05 a card for the third tier.",

So today on my special day when I came downstairs for my day off her credit card was sitting there with a note. I have been using a Star cue with a G-core shaft for the last 10+ years. Thought it was a decent cue when I bought it but also thought it was American made. Either way, it has been a great cue over the years but I haven’t played regularly again until recently as my 10 year old has shown some skill and enjoyment for the game. So I happened to be shopping for the last few months. I had decided between a couple McDermott cue’s but hadn’t ruled out other manufacturers. Wanted a carbon shaft, was thinking thinner diameter but wasn’t sold on it. I read through the cue guides here on this sub-reddit which helped me open up my criteria a bit. I had some cues saved on eBay as that seemed to have the most inventory. But after waking up to that note. I figured I’d open up my requirements even more and see what the local shop had. Now this isn’t a hole in the wall billiards shop. It’s a nice shop in a nice good sized city that sells nice stuff. They were going to be fine with or without my business, but that move with my wife sold me. I rode up to the shop thinking of those eBay Cue’s and how they were exactly what I wanted. I got to the shop and found 3 cues that matched my criteria. One Cuetec, one McDermott, and a wildcard Bull all carbon that was a winner on price. I was also waiting for the McDermott cue of the month as that would be another cool thing but this months cue was just announced and it hits zero of my wants (though the price is ideal). So that was no longer delaying my purchase. The McDermott happened to be this pictured SL10C cue of the month from last November and it was priced at the exact price of the eBay one I was watching. They had the exact cue I wanted at the same price as online! Happy Birthday indeed. It was ",

Thanks in advance for your help! I’ve read the pricing guide but it still leaves a few questions. First I’ll list what I have. Complete Sets of Series 1,2,3 in both holo and non holo - all blue label Complete Sets of Mewtwo Strikes Back and Pokemon 2000 in both holo and non holo - all blue label Additionally I have (all complete sets): - series 1 holo black label - series 1 and 2 non holo blue label - series 3 holo blue label - non holo pokemon 2000 blue label. My biggest question is that I am wondering how to go about pricing and selling all of this. I’ve checked recently sold on eBay and have comps for some.of it, but not all. I’m also curious if it might make sense to list the entire Blue Label complete set as one item, then list the duplicates and extras on their own. It’s all been in binders, sleeves, cases or sleeves and top loaders since about 2000, most of it is LP-NM, some of it is mint. I added some pictures of some of the pages / top loaders etc for reference. Thanks again for taking the time to read this post :) Also - I have some miscellaneous duplicates and bulk of all these sets, holo and non holo, that I’d be happy to send off to someone if they were able to help me get this all ready to sell!",

I wanted to list a working 16TB hard drive, eBay suggested BIN of $11. eeeehhhhh????? Even a non-working 16TB HD is more than $50 so I have no idea why eBay thought this specific brand and model should be sold at $11. I sell LEGO set that I pick up locally at clearance sale and had a couple of 76419 that I picked up for $80 new, they normally go for $170 retail price and a few on eBay for more than $100 used. What did eBay suggest for my 76419, new in box? $22 each!! I really wish I can turn off suggested price permanently because it's using unreliable AI that can't account for condition and/or completeness, and may have grabbed data off someone's replacement firmware chip for the hard drive or a gold colored minifig out of that LEGO set and assumed it represented the whole thing. PS multiple choice listing sucks too. $100 item with $0.99 microfiber cloth makes them show up first when sorted by cheapest. Also keep out of stock listing sucks, they show up weeks and even months as OOS to draw buyer who would think look at seller's other item and end up with a much more expensive item.",

By Ben Burrows — January 21, 2026 Share They say a picture is worth 1,000 words ... but sometimes those words come from a different book. When Carlos Beltran was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Tuesday night, collectors might have started searching for his key rookie cards. Here's the problem: One of those cards, Beltran's 1995 Topps Traded rookie features a photo that is not the eventual Hall of Fame outfielder, but instead is a picture of a teammate who never climbed higher than Class AA. But Beltran isn't alone with this photo error — in fact, he's not even the first Hall of Famer to have an image of someone else pictured on his card. Here are seven baseball cards featuring an unfortunate case of mistaken identity. 1995 Topps Traded Carlos Beltran was elected to Cooperstown with 84% of the vote, but anyone hunting for his flagship rookie card will likely be disappointed. Included in 1995 Topps Traded, the front of Beltran’s rookie with the Kansas City Royals actually shows teammate Juan LeBron, an outfielder who would play 12 seasons of professional baseball, but never reached higher than AA in the United States. According to GemRate, Beltran’s mistaken rookie is by far his most graded card with more than 2,400 authenticated by PSA. PSA adds a designation reading “UER: Juan LeBron Pictured” to each. The public record for the card, according to data tool Card Ladder, is the $1,138 paid for a BGS 10 Pristine examp",

Too good to be true? Evaluating a press pass from an all-time NHL moment Press pass said to be from Bobby Orr's 'Flying Goal' sells on eBay — but is it the real deal? Bobby Orr's \"Flying Goal\" to win the 1970 Stanley Cup final is commemorated with a statue outside the TD Garden. (Credit: Getty Images) By Darren Rovell — July 31, 2025 Share One of the main reasons I love collecting tickets is because there is great arbitrage value — especially when the buyer knows something the seller does not. Being aware something historic happened at a certain game and then getting that ticket graded could yield a turnaround of thousands of dollars. That said, there are also sellers who know collectors are seeking this advantage and play the game in reverse. A press credential sold on eBay for $76. on Wednesday night. It was listed as \"Bobby Orr 'Flying Goal' Ticket Press Pass 1970.\" Every detail on the press pass needed to be closely examined. (Credit: eBay) Now, Orr's flying goal is one of the greatest moments in hockey history and represents an iconic collectible that I'd love to own. So, I went deep in my evaluation to decide if I should bid on this lot. Let's take it step by step with the questions I asked as I investigated: 1. Does the item appear authentic? The credential certainly looks like it could be an old pass, though the gold color seems to be a little aggressive for the 1970s. I would expect it to be a mustard yellow. The writing looks authentically faded. It has the markings of what would make sense with the game being \"SC4\" (Game 4 of the Stanley Cup final) and it being versus the \"STL Blues.\" 2. Can you make the leap the item is from the game listed? All the details on the press pass are hand-wr",

In the interest of keeping variety, I’ve included no duplicate cards in the list, (otherwise the list would just be a bunch of FP-001 sold listings ranked by sale price, which might be an separate and interesting future assignment). The only exceptions to this are FB01-139 and FB06-120, which both appear once as a BGS 10 Black Label and then once as a non-black label PSA/BGS 10. I found this to be a good illustration of the difference between a black label and a regular 10 for the same graded card. As always this is for informational purposes only. If it’s not useful or interesting to you, feel free to move on. **I’ve decided I may just start blocking folks who want to constantly rehash the “people like you are ruining the hobby” argument, when all I’m doing is reporting objective price data. That way they won’t ever see my hard work again which they claim is useless information to them in the first place**. But to the rest of you, enjoy, and happy to discuss anything shown here.",

GameStop is sitting on **$8.8B–$9B in cash**, has a CEO with a **$100B incentive structure** (scaling in $10B tranches) to reward performance, and a strategic **Bitcoin Treasury**. Between the eBay \"**Whale**\" thesis and the \"**Trio**\" roll-up (PSA/Funko/Newegg), RC is building a conglomerate. The **Oct ’26 Warrants (GME/WS)** are the surgical tool for high-leverage ROI, protected by a Board-controlled \"Extension Joker.\" # 1. The Financial Fortress: $9 Billion and a Bitcoin Floor As of late January 2026, GameStop’s balance sheet is an anomaly in the retail world. **\\[1\\]** * **The War Chest**: With \\~$9B in cash and liquid securities, GME is no longer defensive. It is a predator. This cash generates hundreds of millions in interest alone, ensuring consistent profitability even before a single game is sold. * **The Bitcoin Factor**: In 2025, GameStop moved to diversify its treasury into Bitcoin (averaging \\~$107k/BTC for 4,710 coins). **\\[2\\]** While BTC has seen recent volatility (consolidating around $79k), it provides a \"Hard NAV\" (Net Asset Value) floor. Crucially, GME recently moved its holdings to **Coinbase Prime \\[3\\]**, signaling they are preparing for maximum liquidity—likely to fund a massive, immediate cash acquisition. # 2. The $100 Billion Incentive: A Tranche-Based Roadmap On January 7, 2026, Ryan Cohen signed a performance-based stock option award that is 100% \"at-risk.\" This isn't a \"mandate\" to hit $100B overnight, but a highly structured reward system for long-term growth. \\[4\\] * The Tranche System: The award is broken down into nine distinct milestones. The first tranche only vests when GME hits a $20 Billion Market Cap and $2 Billion in cumulative EBITDA. Subsequent tranches vest in $10B increments until the $100B goal is reached. * The \"Buy-In\": This isn't a gift of shares. If RC performs, he earns the right to buy sha",

I bought this card on eBay at an auction for 330 USD; but shipping, taxes and import fees bring up the total to about 425 USD. The problem is that the card arrived with an ident mark on the lower border that wasn't on the listing pictures or description. Seller claims it wasn't there when shipped but is offering a 50 USD refund. I don't grade usually, but in my opinion the proposed refund seems low for such a significant mark. What's the highest PSA grade a card like this can get and would you take the deal? If not, what would you say is a more appropriate refund for it? Thanks in advance for your help!",

          "text": "End of 2025 \"Where to find cards\" Buying Guide **TLDR:** There are no easy ways to get Pokemon cards without spending a lot per pack, sorry. But since a lot of people keep posting and asking, this'll break down what else you can try. **Why cant I find cards:** \\-2025 Popularity Surge and Price Bubble - Starting late 2024 Pokemon card popularity began to once again surge, with the surge came scarcity as product was unable to be fulfilled to meet demand. This unprecedented demand was met with surging prices as well beginning a ridiculous value increase spiral that has caught the eyes of not just the general public but also big money investors. The more money that gets focused into the hobby, the more people start to hear about it, and unfortunately the more people try finding opportunity to make money from others in the hobby. \\-Scalpers - These are the people who follow around card vendors, buy everything they can so that others cant get it, then flip it for 2x or 3x price. If you are dedicated and thorough you can make some serious money doing this BUT IT IS HIGHLY RISKY. One bad buy could tie up thousands and waste your time trying to sell. \\-Cardshops - In response to the popularity and scalpers, many shops have taken to raising prices themselves to take in as much profit while the market is hot. Some may be scalpers themselves hitting up stores to stock their own store, or they can be in cahoots with scalpers buying at just under market price to resell above market price since its still tough to find cards. Its a two way street that never benefits the general buyer. \\-Grading - You pay a company (hopefully reputable) to assess the condition of your card. This is usually done for 2 of the many reasons, protection or resale. Since factories are pumping cards out in a mad rush, quality control is terrible. If a card is assessed at Gem Mint condition (usually listed as a 10) then it is likely in the top percentage of condition for that card, this gives it a massive p",

I inherited them from my dad and I did as much research as I could on 130point, PSA, and eBay but the comps range wildly. Basically looking for whether it’s worth it to get all, some, or none of these cards graded. I am a huge noob so please bear with me, notes listed below: - the Tony Gonzalez Topps Chrome card has an orange border, does that make it more valuable? - the Joe Namath card is in pretty awful condition. Is it even worth selling raw? - I think the Frank Thomas card and 5 other cards from the 1989 NFL Topps set are worth grading since they’re in pretty great condition - same logic as above for Kevin McHale and Julius Erving, they’re in pretty good condition - the remaining 6 basketball cards on the bottom row are pretty beat up. Prob can’t be graded but are they even worth selling raw? Thank you",

          "text": "I’ve been in the hobby for a while and mostly buy singles, but I wanted to try Fanatics Collect’s Instant Rip just to see how everything works. Dropped $250 on a basketball pack just out of curiosity. I actually pulled a legit grail: a 2014 LeBron James patch card. Their system immediately showed a “value” around $1,400, which made no sense at all. Realistic value is maybe $500 to $600. So I skipped their whole end-of-process valuation and took the $1,200 instant credit. That part was easy. Everything after that... not great. The user interface feels like it was designed by someone who doesn’t collect. It’s clunky, the layout is strange, and finding basic info takes more taps than it should. Their weekly auction structure also feels odd. Maybe there’s a reason for it, but from the outside it just seems limiting. Their Card Ladder pricing is rough. They’re pulling comps from 2022, so you basically have to bounce between eBay and their app to figure out real values. It slows everything down and makes it hard to trust what you’re looking at. I used my $1,200 credit toward an overpriced 1980 Topps Bird–Magic–Dr. J rookie PSA 7 listed at $1,600. I paid the extra $400 cash to cover the difference and added it to my collection. Cool. Then I tried to withdraw it. They hit me with a $75 fee. $48 to “withdraw” the card, with no explanation or breakdown. $25 shipping. Plus tax. Paying $75 just to get a card in hand is wild. It makes the whole thing feel like a cash grab built on keeping you inside their ecosystem and charging you every time you try to leave it. At this point I’m deleting the app and won’t be using it again. That’s just my experience, but it was enough for me.",

I have a submission processing right now and I noticed something different when I got my grades revealed to me. After my grade reveal was done, PSA offered to buy my cards off me and gave me a 24 hour countdown to sell to them. Before this submission, my last order cleared in August and I got no such offer in the app or anywhere else. I can’t help but think that PSA, the company that grades cards, is intentionally downgrading certain cards with the hope that I’d sell to them, and they’d just regrade for a 10. I’m not a scrub. I did my due diligence of checking all cards and gently cleaning them before sending them out for grading. Boy was I surprised that only 8 out of 39 came back as 10’s. I can’t shake this feeling that there is an obvious incentive for PSA to screw me out of quality cards so they can auction it themselves in eBay. I dunno, maybe I’m overreacting. Am I crazy in thinking this?",

Need PSA/Card Grading Tips! 🕵️♂️ I was incredibly lucky and managed to acquire 59 copies of the Coffee Break Detective Pikachu promo card. They are all in pristine condition—they've only been handled twice: once to open and once to immediately put them into storage. I've done some research and see a PSA 10 copy can sell for around the $400 range, which has me excited! I believe a large majority of my copies would grade highly, but I'm completely new to the process and need some guidance before I send them in. ❓ My Grading and Shipping Questions PSA Service Levels: I looked at the PSA website and saw different prices for submission. What is the actual difference in service for a higher price? Is it just the turnaround time (how fast they grade them) and the Max Declared Value for insurance/upcharge purposes? I'm only looking to get the cards graded, so I'm not sure which price tier to choose. Trial Submission: I'm planning on submitting a small batch (2 or 3 cards) first to get a feel for the process and see what grades I get back before sending in the rest. Does this sound like a good strategy? Grading Company (PSA vs. Others): Is PSA still the undisputed \"go-to\" and best value-maximizer for modern Pokémon cards? Are there other companies like CGC or BGS that the community prefers, and why? Shipping/Protection (Immediate Concern): This is my most urgent question! I currently do not have penny sleeves or card savers/toploaders. For a temporary solution until I can buy proper supplies, I'm currently using a makeshift method: Placing each card inside the smallest sandwich bag I have. Sandwiching the bagged card between two 5x5-inch pieces of cut-out cardboard. Securing the cardboard with rubber bands in a cross-pattern. Is this an acceptable temporary storage/shipping method to prevent damage while I wait for proper supplies to arrive? I'm worried the rubber bands might be too tight. 💰 Post-Grading: Wh",

The seller answered my question and also said they were hoping for the auction to get bid up higher because they would only make a few dollars if it sold for the starting bid. I thought that was weird but didn’t think much about it again until a few hours before the auction ended, an account with 0 feedback started bidding on the item. I was immediately suspicious and stopped bidding. The account with 0 feedback won the auction. To no one’s surprise, the seller just relisted the same item a few days later with a higher starting bid. I can’t find a way to report them so I just blocked them and won’t buy from them, but PSA if you are a seller, shill bidding is FRAUD and it’s ILLEGAL.",

          "text": "Bought a Fake Card Through eBay’s Authentication Guarantee – eBay Refusing to Help Hi all, I recently purchased a Pokemon card on eBay that was covered under their Authentication Guarantee program. The card was authenticated by PSA and arrived sealed in the tamper proof packaging. However, upon inspection, it's clear that the card is a fake, (Static holo pattern, holo matches with TCGPlayer, 1st Edition stamp is not lined up properly) despite PSA marking it as authentic. I did not do my due diligence prior to purchasing due to it being through the Authentication Guarantee, now I wish I should have. I contacted eBay immediately. They redirected me to another department and unfortunately, they refused to offer a return or refund. Their reasoning was that they trust PSA’s authentication process and won’t override it, even in the case of a clear mistake. Here’s where I currently stand: * I’ve contacted PSA directly and am awaiting their response as they review the case. * The card remains sealed in its tamper proof packaging - I haven’t opened it to ensure the chain of custody is intact. * I'm considering a chargeback as a last resort, but I'd prefer to explore all possible avenues before going down that road. It’s frustrating that eBay’s authentication program which is supposed to protect buyers seems to leave no room for recourse when the authenticator gets it wrong. And ironically, PSA’s involvement has limited my ability to open a standard claim under eBay’s Money Back Guarantee. Any advice on next steps, other contacts, or how to escalate this situation? Thanks in advance.",

It's an AI-powered collection manager for card collectors. **The Problem:** I collect sports cards and Pokemon cards. Managing everything in spreadsheets was a nightmare - manually typing card names, looking up prices, trying to track portfolio value. **The Solution:** SlabTrack uses AI to scan ANY card (graded or raw) and automatically: - Identifies the card (95% accurate) - Pulls live eBay pricing - Organizes your collection - Tracks portfolio analytics **Works for:** - Graded slabs (PSA, BGS, CGC) - Raw cards - Sports cards (all major sports) - Pokemon cards **Free tier:** 7 scans/month, no credit card required **Paid plans:** Start at $4.99/mo Link: slabtrack.io Would love to hear feedback from fellow builders!",

          "text": "Alright TAG gang- Couple of friends suggested I should post this data here as it would benefit everyone dealing with the wild west rodeo of TAG comps. I see a LOT of heated discussion related to how TAG should be comped- Eventually I got tired of the debate and decided to kill 3-4 hours to know for sure. **I understand that a lot of TAG sellers / vendors abide by a PSA 85-95% rule** \\- however more often than not, *to those that aren't TAG collectors, its not something known, or believed.* ***Can the data back that rule up?*** # Problem Outline: * *Lack of historical data (Normative Authority) on Ebay Last Solds causes friction between buyers, vendors, and graders at Card Shows, Ebay, Facebook Marketplace, etc.* * Variation in price or outright exclusion of TAG in PriceCharting, Collectr, CardLadder, and other aggregators causes uncertainty and inability to reach comp agreements. **I want to start this series with Charizard EX #199, because:** * Extremely Popular Modern / Charizard -> It has an abundance of Sold Data * High Value <$1000 -> Big Liquidity # Data Controls: 1. TAG & PSA data was pulled using Ebay Research Seller Tool (public) from \\[7/14/25\\] to \\[10/13/25\\]. 2. Pulled data ONLY for \\[TAG10's\\] & \\[PSA10's\\]. 3. Filtered OUT RAW, BGS, CGC, (and other weird combo deals), etc. **Please NOTE the limitations for Data Analysis:** * **Data is unable to contextualize seller TAT (Turnaround Time)** * Ebay marketplace does not encompass all market activity, and the 13-15% seller fee is considerable drag for people wanting to list to Ebay. * Consider that a LARGE proportion of TAG sales happen offline at Card Shows, FB Marketplace, etc, but IRL markets calibrate to last solds. (I know this is normal, but it's actually insane to think about.) # Major Key Insights (aka TLDR): * **TAG 10 Slabs fetch an average 89% to their PSA 10 counterpart.** * **(Pre-Mania) -** *observing prices pre-pump $1k, the relative TAG to PSA comp range was narrow (82%-98%):* * Normal Thou",

Context: I'm interested in a TAG10 Beedrill V alt art. I've contacted the seller and sent a £120 / $160 offer across. Their response was a counter offer for $200. I asked where the price point is coming from, as last solds on Ebay are between £110-£120 / $150-$160. He said he uses Collectr app for pricing. So i went on Collectr app, and its valuing the TAG10 on there at £90 / $120. So, i asked where the $200 counter offer price point is coming from. The above was their response. For reference, its valuing the PSA10 at $175. Am I missing something or is this insane?",

Searching sold listings will give you accurate comp prices that people are actually paying. **1/1 cards** For 1/1s you need to research card sales from the same player.

Searching sold listings will give you accurate comp prices that people are actually paying. **1/1 cards** For 1/1s you need to research card sales from the same player. Look for other 1/1 cards with similar traits like brand, year, league, patch/auto etc. Then set a relative price yourself. \\---- Bookmark some of these helpful guides: **Determine the value of your trading cards** [https://sundocards.com/resources/determine-the-value-of-your-trading-cards/](https://sundocards.com/resources/determine-the-value-of-your-trading-cards/) **How to value your trading cards** [https://sundocards.com/how-to-value-your-trading-cards-a-beginners-step-by-step-guide/](https://sundocards.com/how-to-value-your-trading-cards-a-beginners-step-by-step-guide/) **Should I hold or sell?** [https://sundocards.com/resources/trading-cards-should-i-hold-or-sell/](https://sundocards.com/resources/trading-cards-should-i-hold-or-sell/) **Should I get this card graded?** [https://sundocards.com/resources/should-i-get-this-trading-card-graded/](https://sundocards.com/resources/should-i-get-this-trading-card-graded/) **Guide to PSA grading** [https://sundocards.com/resources/guide-to-psa-card-grading/](https://sundocards.com/resources/guide-to-psa-card-grading/) **Guide to refractors, parallels and foils** [https://sundocards.com/resources/the-complete-guide-to-types-of-parallels-refractors-and-holographic-hologram-trading-cards/](https://sundocards.com/resources/the-complete-guide-to-types-of-p",

Was helping a family friend (senior citizen) with their older digital camera. Researched and the camera only took up to a 512MB card. I didn't have any cards that old but I found an eBay seller that did. Bought the card, and when it was it was delivered (I wasn't home but my wife was) USPS knocked on our door and had her write a check for the balance on shipping. So I get home, and I message the seller. He tells me he used eBay shipping (yes) and I confirmed the label on the box. Asked him why I had to cover part of the shipping when I thought it was all paid up front, and he had no clue. Took the box, contents and all, to my local USPS and as soon as I got to the counter the clerk says Clerk: eBay? Me: Yeah, eBay. I got charged extra and I... Clerk: That's our box. We recognize those anywhere. Me: Looks at box, and the seller had cut a USPS box open and turned it inside-out and taped it together. \"Ok, I see that.\" Clerk: That's a flat rate box. eBay postage didn't cover the whole rate, so you had to pay the balance. So I opened a case with eBay to recover the extra postage because it's not cool to surprise a customer with an extra charge. USPS had written a note on the box label about extra postage being needed, so I uploaded a pic to eBay but also made it very clear I just wanted a partial refund to cover the extra postage. Seller got the notice and messaged me asking me to close the case and said they weren't in the wrong. I message him back explaining that I shouldn't have to bear the cost of surprise postage, and that he should be upfront and honest with shipping and also shouldn't try to take advantage of \"free\" USPS boxes. He didn't agree of course. After some back and forth with eBay and making it very clear I wa",

          "text": "How I pre-grade my cards before submitting. A guideline to getting 9s and 10s more frequently. So there was a request to go into more detail about pre-grading so I thought I would follow up with what I personally do. Im sure there are plenty of other ways people do it. This is my method. First thing is I will create 2 piles of cards that are contenders. I do a brief scan, look for obvious whitening and off centering. 1 pile is cards I think are strong 10s, while the other pile is 9's + I start with centering first and foremost. Its the most obvious to see so I will scan the cards, and the front of the card is more strict than the back, so I look for pretty much 45/55 centering on cards, and if you arent sure, take some time to look through PSA 10 sold listings on ebay. PSA does make occasional mistakes but it will give you an idea for what good centering looks like. The second thing I will do is look at the back, centering on the back is more lenient but the main thing im looking for is whitening. You can still get a PSA 10 with 2 whitening spots if they arent too bad, 1 is still a 10, and none is even better. Than the next thing I look for on both sides of the cards is any dents, dings, any type of damage what so ever. It will automatically drop your card to a 5-7 even if its a tiny ding you can barely notice. It has a HUGE impact on the grade. The next thing I look at is edges, sometimes the cards have bad edges and its hard to tell but when you compare it to other cards you start to notice that some are clearly worse than others. Its hard to tell sometimes since its so thin, but sometimes it seems like entire cards have these micro dents along the edges and it destroys the gradability and is pretty hard to notice. The last thing I look for and I look real close at multiple angles is any surface issues and scratches on the card. Print lines still happen, scratches still happen. Lately ive noticed random scratches on the backs of the cards more than usual. I suspec",

          "text": "A brief outline of grading pokemon cards. When,what, and why to grade. I see a lot of questions being asked about card grading and a lot of bad information and misconceptions. I will spare you guys a whole book and keep it as concise as possible. In the hobby no matter what shop you go to, what card show, what message board you stumble upon, or which youtuber you watch, it seems like having graded cards is essential to participating in the hobby. While grading is quite popular in pokemon due to the hobby being 90% collectors and investors, in other card games that are built more of players, grading is virtually non existent with the exception of a few cases like vintage magic and numbered cards. Pokemon is completely fueled by hype, and has always been since the day the cards came out. We all had Beckett collector and pojo magazines to research the prices of our cards, and since day one its been a very collectible and value driven card game. Grading got popular during the logan paul boom from the poketubers of the time showing how it was a very profitable money making method and it was as simple as buying a raw card from a shop, grading it, and making profit. Obviously as the popularity grew with logan paul and the insane values of the cards like the 20k bulbasaur(/s) everyone decided to start grading cards, which led to the infamous 1 year + bulk turnaround time on PSA. In this day and age in the hobby grading is so well known and so essential that PSA 9's in a very large amount of cases are worth about the same as the raw cards. The price disparity shrunk rapidly as more and more people starting grading for profit to the point where it is right now which is either psa 10 or bust. Now the main reason to grade a card is to 1, authenticate, and 2 maximize the price discovery. Authenticating real cards is important for obvious reasons. Take a 1/1 card like the one ring in magic for example, even if its grades a psa 5, its important to know its authentic and its offici",

I am a long-time collector of this hobby that recently came back after taking a break when the Sun and Moon era ended, and I despise this hobby. First, I can't even get new product because people keep buying it out and it is so frustrating, because I do NOT want to support scalpers on eBay. I hate prismatic evolutions with every fiber of my being, and I think that this is one of the most overhyped and \"FOMO\" sets in the history of this hobby. I can't go to one card show without these new-gen modern only vendors that started last month shoving eeveelution cards down my throat. No, I DO NOT want to buy your color dog for 2 grand, and I'm sorry I won't sell my cards at 40% because you've \"never heard of a rainbow rare\" and \"it's not expensive enough.\" I want to make up for lost time so badly, but I cannot fathom how people justify that a CARD THAT IS STILL IN PRINT (umbreon ex psa 10) is more expensive than a decently conditioned 1ST EDITION BASE SET CHARIZARD (which is obtainable with some wear on the card). Next, the Pokémon community's social setting has deteriorated as a whole, especially the people that represent this community. A lot of the Youtubers that have been with this community for years have bought into the hype and have turned out to be pieces of shit. Leonhart especially pisses me off, and that \"trade up\" video he posted really rubbed me the wrong way. Whatnot has also gotten much worse (although in my opinion the platform wasn't the greatest) with these giant streamers inflating the prices of singles even more, with their massive toxic fanbases buying into their mindless ramble. I know the Pokémon Company isn't at fault entirely for the scalping of the modern sets, but I wish that they prepared a little bit better for it. A longer waiting period between sets would be welcomed with open arms if they had more time to stock up o",

The Question i have is why didn't psa grade it is it because its a regular silver prizm with a sticker auto added on and a beckett authenticated sticker on the back? Also Would any other companies grade it such as BGS/SGC? I'm thinking about sending it to BGS and see if they will grade it but wanted to know if anyone has had this happen to them or had any recommendations! *Pics of Silver Prizm Sticker Auto Herbert Card Below - https://gyazo.com/27302c55ec0032c757daf2bbd5332764 *Beckett Authentication - https://gyazo.com/a267419dfe3499a2e8f112e1bd87b2ba",

          "text": "**TLDR:** There are no easy ways to get Pokemon cards without spending a lot per pack, sorry. But since a lot of people keep posting and asking, this'll break down what else you can try. **Why cant I find cards:** \\-2025 Popularity Surge and Price Bubble - Starting late 2024 Pokemon card popularity began to once again surge, with the surge came scarcity as product was unable to be fulfilled to meet demand. This unprecedented demand was met with surging prices as well beginning a ridiculous value increase spiral that has caught the eyes of not just the general public but also big money investors. The more money that gets focused into the hobby, the more people start to hear about it, and unfortunately the more people try finding opportunity to make money from others in the hobby. \\-Scalpers - These are the people who follow around card vendors, buy everything they can so that others cant get it, then flip it for 2x or 3x price. If you are dedicated and thorough you can make some serious money doing this BUT IT IS HIGHLY RISKY. One bad buy could tie up thousands and waste your time trying to sell. \\-Cardshops - In response to the popularity and scalpers, many shops have taken to raising prices themselves to take in as much profit while the market is hot. Some may be scalpers themselves hitting up stores to stock their own store, or they can be in cahoots with scalpers buying at just under market price to resell above market price since its still tough to find cards. Its a two way street that never benefits the general buyer. \\-Grading - You pay a company (hopefully reputable) to assess the condition of your card. This is usually done for 2 of the many reasons, protection or resale. Since factories are pumping cards out in a mad rush, quality control is terrible. If a card is assessed at Gem Mint condition (usually listed as a 10) then it is likely in the top percentage of condition for that card, this gives it a massive premium. A card worth $100 normally can jump to ",

          "text": "Buyer claims \"Not Received\" despite \"Delivered\" status & paying fees. Am I safe? Hi everyone, I’m looking for advice on a situation with a buyer in Switzerland (I am in Germany). I sold a Funko Pop (around €80) and shipped it via UPS. Since it was an international sale to a non-EU country, customs fees were applied. The timeline: Feb 13: UPS tracking shows \"Import C.O.D. charges have been paid or billed.\" Feb 13: The buyer messaged me privately, very angry about the UPS fees, stating: \"I’ve never had to pay ever import fees for a shipment that is under 150 let alone this one that is 80 I’ve ordered million times from same carrier and Germany never paid that fee.” “I have now paid it however very unhappy with it I would like my money back.\" Feb 16: Tracking officially shows \"DELIVERED\" in Zurich. Feb 17 (Today): The buyer opened an \"Item Not Received\" request, claiming: \"Marked as arrived didn't come... I not got anything.\" The contradiction: In the eBay case, the buyer is claiming they never received the item. However, they explicitly messaged me on Feb 13th confirming they paid the customs fees. Since you usually only pay these fees to UPS upon or for delivery, this proves they were in contact with the courier regarding this package. I've already uploaded the tracking and sent a message in the case pointing out their earlier admission. My questions: Since tracking says \"Delivered,\" am I 100% safe under eBay’s seller protection? Does the fact that they admitted to paying fees on the 13th (matching the tracking) help prove they are lying? Should I just wait until Feb 20th to \"Ask eBay to step in\"? The buyer is being aggressive and said they \"will no longer reply.\" Any advice?",

I am completely new to mtg, im 23 and remember all the way back to middle school when a kid was playing some kind of blue colored mill deck, and at some point talked about how awesome slivers are. Eventually I asked my dad for my birthday for some slivers some time shortly after I saw that kid playing. For my birthday I got the sliver overlord, hivelord, gemhide, the poison one, and the blue swimming one (i forget both of their names). I never once played any matches, but the cards were cool and I still have them! Now my buddy recently got into magic, and in turn he got me into magic. Both because they're fricking cool and for nostalgia reasons I want to make a sliver deck. Ideally a really good one. We want to play commander format, since he has a commander LOTR deck. From what ive read, slivers are better off as a commander deck than standard anyways so yippee. What I want advice on is what is the best way to go about getting a 100 card sliver deck? Ive looked on ebay, and there are quite a few prebuilt decks for around 300-400$. Ouchie thats a lot of moola for a newbie. Im not stranger to spending lots of money on things I dont need, but is there a better way to go about creating the deck I want? (Granted idk exactly what I want, I just want as good of a sliver commander deck as I can get) Should I just buy each one as singles instead of a prebuilt? Wouldn't that get even more ridiculously expensive because of the shipping costs on 100 individually shipped cards? Also, I kind of want to have more than just the 100 cards. Say I buy a prebuilt for around 300-400$, that's still only 100 cards, many of which are just lands and some generic spells or artifacts anyways. So maybe I could try to collect multiples and get as many uniques as there are. (the hive must grow so to speak) I understand some specific cards like sliver queen may be super pricey. I also understand that slivers may not be a top tier deck at all anymor",

Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get very far with actionable items needed to rectify my randomly restricted account and hold on all payments even if the funds are available, so maybe someone here can help me understand what I am trying to get comprehend. I have a new account that's about a month old. Just something I've always thought about doing. Well, it came time to do it as I scored a windfall of inventory that was really cool. So, I research and study. Learn everything I can so I can do this well. I went all in and things were going great. In about a month I sold 15 items, a few of which were higher ticket and one was much higher ticket. And I am packing like a crazy person because I care, shipping at least next day. Items get delivered, get a couple glowing reviews. I'm loving it. Really seeing how I can make this into something. But I'm also not getting paid. I have funds ready to be released and one on hold. I understand there is a waiting period that's fine. But I'm not getting paid anything. I have only been paid out on the very first item I ever sold which was sold on Jan. 2nd. I have items that were delivered on the 16th and earlier and haven't been paid. I'm thinking, new account selling a decent amount right away and selling more expensive items, too. Understandable I might have to wait a bit. No problem, I guess. I heard that goes away once you have more time on the platform. Then tonight, I find my account is restricted and I need to verify my ID and also upload tracking for an order that I had just received. I upload my ID. No big deal. Kind of weird since you have all my info and bank details but fraud exists so I get it. But I don't have tracking for this new order obviously. So, I reach out. Ebay assistant is laughably awful. I make my way to what could have been a real person but seemed like slightly more capable AI than the assistantI . I succumb to getting a call. Things go really south here. I a",

          "text": "Best Sports Card Scanner App I've Found – Baseball Card Values, PSA Grading Estimates & More Been lurking on this sub for a while and always see people asking how to value their collections. Last month I inherited a shoebox full of my dad's old baseball cards from the 80s and 90s – we're talking hundreds of cards with no idea what's junk and what's gold. I spent hours manually searching eBay sold listings before giving up. Tried a couple apps but the recognition was hit or miss. Then a buddy at my LCS mentioned SnapCard and honestly it's been a game changer for organizing everything. **What I actually like about it:** * **The sports card scanner is stupid fast** – just snap a photo of any baseball card, basketball card, or football card and it identifies it almost instantly. Saved me so much time going through that shoebox. * **Real-time price guide pulls from actual sold data** – not just random asking prices. It aggregates from eBay, Goldin, Heritage Auctions, and PWCC so you're seeing what cards actually sell for. * **The PSA grading estimates are surprisingly accurate** – I was skeptical about the AI grading analysis, but I sent in 5 cards to PSA and the app predicted 4 of them exactly right (missed one by half a grade). Also does Beckett grading and SGC grading estimates if that's your preference. * **Collection manager actually works** – I can finally track my card collection value over time instead of random spreadsheets. **Cards it supports:** Works with pretty much everything I've thrown at it – baseball cards, basketball cards, football cards, hockey cards, even my kid's Pokemon cards and some MTG cards I had lying around. Basically covers sports cards and trading card games. **Not perfect though:** * Vintage cards pre-1970 can be spotty on recognition * Wish there was a web version for bulk scanning * Some of the market trends data could be more detailed **Who it's good for:** If you're a casual collector with a pile of cards you need to sort through, or ",

          "text": "Can I escalate to the Financial Ombudsman if eBay refund buyers using my pending funds without responding to my complaint? Hi, I’m from England and I’m seeking legal advice on this situation. I sold three orders totalling around £2,000 using eBay’s “Simple Delivery” service (which includes Royal Mail tracking and lost-parcel coverage). Two of the parcels haven’t moved since they were scanned into the Royal Mail system, so the buyers opened “item not received” cases. Shortly after, my account was suspended — I suspect because of those two lost parcels, though eBay haven’t confirmed. I was told my payments would be held for 190 days, which I was okay with. However, eBay refunded both buyers using my pending funds, leaving me around £1,500 out of pocket. On the case screen, it said I didn’t need to take any action, and since Simple Delivery is meant to include coverage for lost parcels, I assumed both sides would be protected. I’ve already sent a formal complaint to eBay’s complaints email (confirmed by a customer service agent), but I haven’t received a response yet. My legal question is: If eBay don’t respond to my complaint within 15 days, how do I get a final response letter so I can escalate the issue — and would that go to CEDR or the Financial Ombudsman Service, given that it involves withheld seller funds and refunds taken from my pending balance? Any legal guidance on how to proceed would be really appreciated.",

It should be 1.99 x 13.25% = 25 CENTS FOR THEM IF ANYTHING not the fucking shipping label AND the item itself combined to take A WHOLE DOLLAR WHILE I GET CENTS!!! 0.87$ is what i made when realistically it SHOULD HAVE BEEN 1.25 or A FUCKING DOLLAR AMOUNT!!😀😀😀 im about to switch over to actual comic book websites cause atleast (i think) their honest about the fees they’ll charge and take. Don’t give me the “ohhh its ebay thats just how they make their” THEY MAKE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO JUST TAKE THE DAMN QUARTER ANS GIVE THE SELLER THE DOLLAR THAT HE IS RIGHTFULLY OWED!!!!

          "text": "Sports Card Bulk Add to My Collection via CSV - Purchase Price Error Need Help Hello Everyone, I am trying to bulk add Sports Cards to my Ebay Collection through a CSV for the purpose of selling later. I am testing it out with a couple cards and I keep getting an error \"Rows 2-11 Property \"purchasePrice\" with value \"0.19\" is invalid\" - I changed the price to 1 and then it worked but of course I didn't pay a dollar per card, I paid 19 cents. I know ebay only wants numbers in this field and no symbols ($ for example) but in the example they provided, they were using a period for cents so I don't know why this isn't working. Very frustrated and any help would be appricated! Thanks!",

The seller has now taken $100 off my return because \"it's been used\" I bought a full-size bottle of perfume from an Ebay seller a few weeks ago. Looking back, this was a dumb decision. The seller had about 30,000 sales and a 5 star average review. Still, I should have looked into this more. This was my own dumb mistake that I won't be making again, however... As soon as I received the item I got a bad feeling it was a fake. There was a sticker on the plastic wrap of the box saying it was made in China. When I took off the wrapping, the box was a bit dented and scuffed. The inside of the box was discolored as well. The bottle of perfume was slightly scratched and the cap to the bottle was scuffed up. I gave the seller the benefit of the doubt, though. Maybe this bottle had fallen off some truck and still could be authentic. However, I have a sample of this perfume already and I sprayed this bottle all of 1 time and it smelled nothing like the sample I have. I know this is a fake. It was sold as a new, sealed box authentic item. I immediately requested a refund, which was immediately accepted. The next day I dropped the package off at the post office with all of the materials I received included in the package (plastic wrap, sticker, bubble wrap, etc.) I just received an email saying the seller is only giving me half of my refund ($90 out of a $180 purchase) because \"it wasn't returned in the original condition\" and \"the item was opened used by the buyer\". This seems a little harsh to me considering a) this is a counterfeit item that I could not have known was counterfeit until I opened the box and sprayed the perfume, and b) the only difference between the condition I received it in and the condition I sent it back in was some opened plastic wrap and 1 spray out of a 75mL bottle of fake perfume. I'm wondering if I have any recourse for this. I know I can \"ask Ebay to step in\" by basically su",

I have rounded up all my graded/slabbed cards I am hoping to sell... roughly 30 cards with cards ranging from $50-$2500 in value. I have only sold a few things on eBay personally and thought I’d give the PSA Vault a try with the lower commissions and their larger reach for views. Plus taking me out of the equation for shipping etc... now that I’m reading more, I am seeing issues with customer support, listings, duties etc. Has anyone on here, more so Canadians for duties/shipping etc, but even in general.... had a good experience? I also have about 15-20 cards I was planning on sending for grading and then have them transferred to the vault fo resale.... but now I’m reconsidering because I hear you can’t as a Canadian, that the cards will be sent back to you and then you have to pay to reship them to the vault. With all this said, these are just some cards I am trying to offload so I can continue to fund my collection addiction 😝 , not being used as a “business”",

Auctions were smooth as butter, all cards sold at market or above. My only complaint is receiving payment from psa and stripe. Its godawfully slow. I mean like 1970s processing slow. I dont know if its PSA, Stripe, or ebay. My guess its Stripe. But if they dont immediately improve this process. Id be better off auctioning them myself. But other then that I would strongly encourage everyone to utilize this method over selling to PSA, or even vendors. I personally feel this market is going to turn into a competition of who's paying the highest %.",

Now I see that many cards sold on Feb 6th are still in \"payment processing\" status. A couple switched to SOLD already (even from later days) but I cannot seem to find a \"guideline\" for that. Did PSA Vault changed their policy regarding payment processing timeline? I seem to remember someone reached out to support and got a specific answer (i.e. payment is processed xxx days after item shipment or something like that). I am all for quick payments but what really matters to me the most is having clear info (if the new standard is a certain number of days so be it, but I can't find a info anywhere in their pages).

          "text": "PSA Vault Holding Card Hostage Back in September I sent this card as well as about 40 others to the vault and sent in a big grading order as well from a PSA staffed drop off event. Long story short I’ve been trying to list this card on eBay via the vault. I thought it was a glitch so I tried on a few different days but it wouldn’t go. I reach out to the vault who within 12 hours respond saying that the card was damaged in shipping and I should talk to my mailman about the damage. I said no- my cards were checked for damage at the drop off event by PSA staff and shipped in to the vault by PSA themselves. The card doesn’t actually look damaged if you see the pics but if it is then they need to fix it, their shipping, their insurance. I waited a few days for a response but nothing came, I wrote in again and nothing. I calle customer service, the rep agreed with me and said they would try to get it expedited. Nothing. Original request to them was Jan 19, response Jan 20th. Now it’s Super Bowl Sunday and I have a PSA 10 rookie auto /10 of one of the team stars and I have no card, in hand or on eBay. Moral of the story, don’t use the vault- they have complete shit customer service and don’t use drop off events for vault shipping, because apparently PSA doesn’t know how to safely ship items.",

          "text": "Mastering the Collectibles Chain: GameStop’s Vertical Strategy I want to propose my two cents on what I think could be \"something that really has never been done before within the history of the capital markets\". This is what I'm titleing Mastering the Collectibles Chain: GameStop’s Strategy. I want to explore GameStop as a future integrated collectibles, custody, and financialization platform, sitting at the intersection of physical assets, digital ownership, valuation, insurance, and liquidity. The core idea is simple: GameStop dominates the entire collectibles value chain. It becomes the infrastructure layer for collectible value itself. It isn't just a retailer anymore. So GameStop shifts from retailer to asset platform. The recent move into graded collectibles and power packs looks like a gimmick, but they can be more of just products. Collectibles are financial assets. These components can be combined to create automated, transparent, and interoperable transactions, in case of GameStop, it becames the infrastructure itself. The important part is this: GameStop is no longer just selling inventory. It is redistributing value. Once a company does that, the next logical step is to own the system that defines, stores, insures, and revalues that value over time. Graded collectibles (PSA 8, 9, 10 etc.) already behave like semi-financial instruments. They have standardized grading, trade on secondary markets, have historical price data, sensitive to condition, scarcity, and demand, globally recognized. What they lack is institutional infrastructure. GameStop will acquire the necessary infrastructure. GameStop is uniquely positioned to collapse all of this into a single stack. The PSA is the keystone. If you control grading, you control authenticity, condition, market trust, value boundaries. GameStop does not need to immediately acquire PSA. A deep strategic partnership is enough at first. GameStop stores already are physical intake points, customers drop cards locall",

Clearly they waited to see how he did in the playoffs before deciding to pay, since they have 10 days to do so. He didn't do well. They didn't pay. It's now almost 4 weeks later from the day I accepted. It's still stuck in the eBay \"no stock left\" status.

Alot of them are duplicate cards. I decided to list around 10 per day through the vault on ebay for the next 7 days with a $0.99 auction start. Market value is around 350 per psa 10 with around 7-16 sold daily according to cardladder, ebay sold, and Pricecharting. My goal with this was to get closer to 87% per sale instead of PSA buyback offers of 72%. Essentially im curious if psa auctions typically go way under market in a auction or if the market follows reported sales data. Does anyone else have experience with this?",

I hear you and completely understand your concern regarding the delayed payment for a sold card in your Vault, and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and concern this situation has caused. The delay is due to a technical issue that we’ve been actively working through with our internal teams and our payment partner, Stripe. Please know that we hear your concerns and are very sorry for any frustration this may have caused. We’ve made a temporary operational adjustment to payout timing in coordination with eBay. During this period, payouts from eBay sales may take up to five business days to process after the buyer submits payment. Once the payout is released, please allow an additional one to three business days for the funds to fully process and appear in your bank account, depending on your financial institution. We understand how frustrating delays like this can be and truly appreciate your patience while this temporary adjustment remains in place. Please note that PSA Partner Offer payouts are not impacted and continue to process within one to two business days. If, after this timeframe, you still do not see the payment reflected for this card, please feel free to reply directly to this ticket and I will be happy to look into it further for you. Thank you for your patience and for choosing the PSA\"",

          "text": "Vault and eBay In September I went to a PSA submission event at Real Sportscards in Champlain MN, mind that this is a direct PSA event with PSA employees present taking grading and Vault submissions. I did a drop off for a 52 item grading order and submitted another 40ish cards to the vault. PSA was in charge of all packaging and shipping of the vaulted items. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago when I try listing a PSA 10 Jaxon Smith Njigba Panini Legacy Rookie auto pink/gold /10. It won’t list, try it again, it won’t list. Try again the next day, still doesn’t work. I reach out to the vault to find out what’s up and I get a response in about 12 hours. Vault employee tells me the card was damaged during transit to PSA and that I should talk to MY mailman. Uhm no... this was a submission that was transited by PSA from an event, damage insurance coverage is on them. He also sent me a picture of the supposed damage. The card looks exactly like it did in its grade reveal... so #1. I don’t believe that it is damaged at all and that it is just coded wrong and they’re not pulling the card out to actually look at it. I wasn’t notified of any damage when my cards were vaulted. So if it was damaged and couldn’t be sold why would I want it to continue to be in the vault? #2. If it actually is damaged, the rep says specifically in the message that it looks to have been damaged in transit - the cards were all verified prior to the submission with a rep who closely examined them and actually gave me back several other cards he determined to not be eligible for the vault due to damage. So similar to how they force place insurance on us via premiums above the regular fees, what insurance does PSA have on things they ship from events? Compensation is due if the damage was caused by their shipping method. Right? #3. It really sucks to have a vaulted card that could easily bring in multiples of its predicted value due to the Seahawks now going to the Super Bowl. It’s a /10 PSA 10 r",

          "text": "I got tired of using 5 different apps to price cards for my shop, so I built my own AI-powered alternative. (Beta Access) I own a small card shop in the UK (Devon based!), and for years I’ve been frustrated with the \"pricing shuffle\"—switching between eBay, a calculator, five different pricing apps, and static price guides just to give a customer a fair price. It was slow, and half the time the data was lagging or inaccurate. So, I decided to do something about it. I’ve spent the last few months building **Price This**—a fully AI-powered intelligent market pricing system. **What makes it different?** **1. The \"Ultimate Average\" (Base Layer):** We don't just guess. We pull data from **PriceCharting, CardMarket, TCGPlayer, and Google results**, extrapolating and averaging their market prices to establish a solid global baseline. **2. The AI & Real-Time Intelligence (Top-Spec Layer):** Once we have that baseline, we apply our **Human-Reasoning AI** and **Official eBay Partner Data**. Instead of just using \"Yesterday's Data,\" the AI detects changes in real-time. It filters out \"wash trading,\" shill bids, and outliers. It \"thinks\" like you do: *\"Oh, one just sold for this much? It's from this set, this era, holds this popularity... therefore the real-time price is THIS.\"* **3. Kiosk Mode:** A feature I built specifically for vendors/traders. You can visualize a trade live, input cash vs. trade credit, and let the app calculate the mathematically perfect deal. **4. The Vault:** Tracks your profit, not just value.

Today, I received an offer from PSA to sell one of my cards through PSA Vault, and I accepted the offer and completed the sale. After the sale, I was informed that I cannot receive the payment unless I have a Stripe account. As far as I understand, Stripe payouts are not available in my country. Why is Stripe the only payout option? It feels outdated and extremely restrictive for international users. If I had known that Stripe was required, I would never have accepted the offer or sold the card in the first place. PSA says this is their policy, but allowing international sellers to complete transactions without a valid payout method makes no sense. This is a serious issue, especially for higher-value cards. Has anyone else experienced this problem with PSA Vault or PSA Marketplace as a non\\_toggle international seller? How was it resolved?",

As a \"Pro\" member (25 USD a year) You get 5% off every card and 2% in points for future cards. And surprinsingly to me most cards are priced just at what Card Ladder says then with the 5% off and the 2% points back I get a good price. I am sending them all to the PSA Vault so no taxes either. I gotta say it makes the whole process frictionless. and has me checking periodically for new ones. I do have like 10 enhacements I could suggest them but its good enough. 🚀",

Ain’t no fucking way I’m writing a post like this from scratch, but I do think it’s a good pitch and should be considered. I’m here for good DD, if ai can help, why are we limiting ourselves from discussion? **TL;DR:** Collectors Holdings CEO sits on GameStop’s board for free. PE investors (including Steve Cohen’s family office) need an exit after 5 years. GameStop has $9B+ in cash. The same Steve Cohen who bailed out Melvin Capital in January 2021 may have no choice but to sell Ryan Cohen the dominant force in collectibles authentication. ----- ##The Board Seat That Doesn’t Make Sense (Unless It Does) In November 2024, GameStop appointed Nat Turner—Chairman and CEO of Collectors Holdings—to its Board of Directors. One month earlier, GameStop became an authorized PSA dealer. Ryan Cohen’s board is tight and hand-picked. You don’t get a seat for a dealer agreement. Turner receives no compensation for his board role. He’s the CEO of a company valued at $4.3 billion, sitting on GameStop’s board for free. **Why?** Because when this deal closes, he’ll be one of the largest GameStop shareholders. ----- ##What is Collectors Holdings? Collectors has quietly consolidated the entire collectibles authentication industry: |Brand |Category |Position | |-------|----------------------|-----------------------------| |PSA |Trading cards |#1 globally, 71% market share| |SGC |Trading cards |Acquired Feb 2024 | |Beckett|Trading cards & comics|Acquired Dec 2025 | |PCGS |Coins & currency |Industry leader | |WATA |Video games |Industry leader | |Goldin |Auction marketplace |Premium collectibles | According to GemRate, PSA graded 18.3+ million cards in 2025. **Combined with SGC and Beckett, Collectors now owns 79% of all card grading.** They don’t dominate the market.

This item has been refunded.” I’m genuinely confused how an inventory issue is possible with a PSA-graded, serial-numbered card that’s stored in their vault. This isn’t a fungible item—it’s a specific slab with a unique cert number. Has anyone else experienced this with PSA Vault? I’m kind of at a loss here. I didn’t want a refund—I wanted the card.",

          "text": "A Guide to Expected Value: How to See If a Card is Profitable to Grade Hey everyone. I am planning to do a regular series going through the most profitable cards to buy and grade, but first I want to have a guideline to find the Expected Value of grading a card. I tried to make this beginner friendly, so bear with me if this feels too basic. Anyways... This is a guide to finding the Expected Value (EV) of grading a card. We find that this is one of the most important concepts to buying and grading cards profitably! The idea is that we look for cards where the EV of grading the card is significantly higher than the cost of buying it. While a positive EV does **not** guarantee that every purchase will be profitable, it does mean on average your purchases will be profitable if you’re buying 10s, 100s, or 1,000s of cards. I think it’s important that you guys know, this is *exactly* how we approach buying cards in our business. We have our card evaluation spreadsheet structured to follow this exact logic, and had really strong success in 2025 with a net profit margin of 24% and total ROI on card purchases of 35%. # Finding the Market Values To determine the expected value of any card, first we’re going to look at the PSA 9 and PSA 10 values of the cards. We generally assume that a card will grade as either a PSA 9 or a PSA 10. There’s a few reasons that this works. 1. We buy mostly Ultra Modern cards. These have a very high probability of grading as a 9 or 10. 2. We aim for a minimum of a 25% expected return on investment (ROI) for every card we purchase. This gives us more than enough margin of error to get a couple of PSA 8s or worse and still make profit. You’ll see more on ROI in a later section. You can find the graded values of your cards using eBay’s Product Research tool or market research services like CardLadder. Let’s use a simple example card that we will use throughout this tutorial. * PSA 10 Value: $2,000 * PSA 9 Value: $1,000 * Raw Price: $1,000 # Gem Rate",

          "text": "PSA Vault Withdrawal Experience: Consumer Beware I like the general concept of the PSA Vault. Recently I had a few cards that have been in the vault for about 6 months that I wanted to withdraw as gifts for Christmas—I didn’t think it would be a big issue. However after waiting over 2 business weeks for them to ship my cards I received no confirmation. When I reached out the representative said: *We're currently working through a high volume of collectibles, and most orders are shipping within 14-16 business days of the request. However, this is only an estimate, so it's possible it could be slightly sooner or longer.* I asked for the withdrawal to be canceled (they never even left my vault) and they said yes. When I asked for a refund for the withdraw fee and shipping they said they are both non-refundable. I can kind of understand the withdrawal fee being non-refundable but the shipping fee when the item was never shipped should be refunded. I asked to speak to their supervisor and was stone walled—at that point I’m pretty sure I was talking to AI. (Funny how they hire AI customer support but not AI grading). If a bank or brokerage firm did not allow me to withdraw my funds in a timely manner they would be defunct. PSA Vault not having their logistics together enough to simply ship stored items is insane and really diminishes the product as a whole. I’m very disappointed in the withdrawal feature of PSA Vault and seriously makes me reconsider using them as my default shipping location going forward. I just wanted to let you all know this experience in case you were wondering what the withdrawal service was like. **TLDR: PSA Vault has a terrible withdrawal service and I don’t recommend anyone relying on it.**",

I typically win a few and have been paying for everything at once in the evening before bed. Recently, however, it seems that the PSA Store on eBay has a 60-minute auto-pay enabled. Auto-pay itself is fine, but I need all of the cards I purchase to remain in the PSA Vault. The issue is that auto-pay defaults to shipping the cards to my home. Most of the time I catch it in time and change the option, but sometimes I’m busy in the evening and miss the window before auto-pay triggers, preventing me from selecting the vault option. Does anyone know how to turn off the 60-minute auto-pay? Or have the default shipping option go to my vault? I’ve gone through all of my eBay settings and can’t find anything related to this. I’ve also messaged PSA through eBay and contacted eBay support, but so far I’ve only received generic responses with no clear answer. Thanks!",

After a month of dealing with that, I decided to ship back to me and I’ll sell myself. And the point of the post is this is the current timeframe you can expect shipping from the vault: 15 Nov: Paid to ship from vault, cost $13 total including under 90 day fee. Status changed to “shipped” but did not receive a tracking number. Nothing for almost a month... 12 Dec: I finally cracked and decided to make another ticket. As I was typing of the ticket I decided to check my email one last time and somehow got the shipping info at that exact moment. 16 Dec: card arrived, signature required.

          "text": "Warning when using Courtyard.io Serious Concerns About Courtyard.io – “Vaulted” Card Could Not Be Produced I’m posting this as a warning to other collectors. I redeemed a high-end card from Courtyard.io that was explicitly represented as being held in their vault. After the redemption was processed, I was informed the card could not be located. The only resolution offered was wallet credit based on their internal valuation, and covered shipping costs. This wasn’t just any card: • Jamaal Charles auto/patch 08/15, Low population and the only graded copy in existence, let alone a PSA 10 • It was effectively a 1/1 • Purchased as a long-term investment • My first redeemed card on the platform When a platform built on “secure vaulting” cannot produce a low population PSA 10, that’s not a minor operational issue — it’s a fundamental breakdown of trust and inventory integrity. At this point, it’s difficult to believe this card was ever actually in the vault or accurately represented at the time of sale. If a vaulted asset doesn’t exist when redeemed, then buyers are taking on risks they were never clearly informed about. I’m sharing this because this experience has ended my use of the platform, and I suspect it will for others once they understand what “vaulted” can really mean in practice. Do your own due diligence. Ask hard questions. Don’t assume safeguards exist just because they’re advertised.",

          "text": "From Ecuador, trying to build tools for collectors — not just another grading label. I’m a long-time collector from Ecuador who somehow ended up running a small grading project. Instead of doing a pure “look at my company” post, I wanted to share what we’re trying to build and ask if this actually makes sense from a collector’s point of view. Context: collecting from Latin America If you live in the US, you send your cards to PSA/BGS/CGC and that’s it. If you live in most of Latin America, it’s a mess: you ship through intermediaries you pay crazy shipping and customs you wait months and you still don’t have any real digital way to manage your collection I’m trying to solve that problem first, and grading is just the entry point. The project is called OGS (Opulence Grading System), based in Ecuador, but the idea is bigger than just slabbing cards. --- The idea: a “collector tools” platform, not a marketplace clone What we’re building inside the user account is basically: 1. Ownership transfer between users If two collectors trade/sell peer-to-peer, they can move the card from one account to another inside the system. No marketplace, no listing fees – just a record of who currently owns it. 2. Ability to “release” a card If you sell a card outside the platform (show, Instagram, eBay, whatever), you can release it so the next owner can claim it. That way there aren’t 5 people saying “that card is mine” years later. 3. A real collection manager Front/back images, serial, grade details, ownership status – all in one place. Nothing fancy visually yet, but functional. 4. Things we want to add if the base works direct send-to-auction for some houses AI-assisted pre-grading digital vaulting population reports an optional “trust”/reputation layer for peer-to-peer deals optional public profiles for people who actually want visibility This is not meant to replace eBay or MySlabs or anything like that. The goal is simply to give people in this region tools we never had.",

          "text": "I got lucky, but be careful. This is a full on degen casino at your fingertips! I'm going to tell my story with Power Packs and how it could have gone very, very wrong for me. It first started when I got the email from GameStop promoting beta access to their Power Pack site. I started on the small packs, but got nothing too great. Then I got my first chase from the $100 pack, the Surging Sparks Pikachu (at the time worth $900-$1000). [First Chase Hit](https://preview.redd.it/dwbqjafj5x4g1.png?width=1863&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcb1b3f908306e7d54a1af3127c4094b9e774b85) It all spiraled down from there. Kept on spending, selling pack, and \"pulling\" the lever so to speak. I cashed out when I \"won\", but had a tendency to push my luck. And as a result, I kept losing to the house which is the Power Pack casino. Thousands and thousands of dollars down the drain within less than a month. All spent on credit cards. As I pulled more and more, I got a few hits, but a LOT of misses. Then the Lunar Packs got announced and I rolled twice. First time, I broke \"even\" with a PSA 9 #4 Charizard (worth $1.8k to $3.3k) [First Lunar Pack](https://preview.redd.it/lntkmjzk5x4g1.png?width=1849&format=png&auto=webp&s=78a565342d8c13d6ad9579cdafec809d68df2815) Then my second Lunar Pack, I got the #17 Umbreon Gold Star (worth $11,750) and instantly sold it. I later checked the sale history for this card and I was SO FUCKING LUCKY that the last one sold for $11k on eBay for GameStop to even offer that big of a buyback. [Second Lunar Pack](https://preview.redd.it/1o41gecw5x4g1.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e94c958e275766ead4ee9169bb5263371f71e20) [Not Taking Any Chances](https://preview.redd.it/eerz8edo5x4g1.png?width=1773&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b44caeff830c11f904247f4dcd223cca0dc6ceb) If there was any notion of a sign to get the fuck out, this was it. I immediately cashed out my earnings, signed out, blocked the website, blocked site scripts and locked my all high credit limit credits c",

Context: -2 most recent sales ~770 -Traditionally a 650-800 card -4 consecutive sales between 11/16-11/20 around 500 I’ve had plenty of cards where this scenario is flipped; I go to accept the offer on my Vaulted card, and it’s expired.

So I play on Xbox, and normally when I am done, I just dashboard out, that way when I jump back in, I just quick start to where I was, without having to wait for the game to load. Well I competed my daily vault card missions on Thursday, and yesterday when I quick started back in, I was still showing the completed missions from the day before. I didn't think much of it, as I just assumed they hadn't reloaded yet, and I didn't end up getting to play for that long anyways. However, when I jumped back on today, they were still the same completed missions. That's when I realized I probably had to quit out to the main menu, and low and behold, the fresh missions updated.

I am not too familiar with the value of the cards, and I am not familiar with most of the players. I recently found out about PSA Vault, but am still confused on my next steps. I am trying to save time. Should I send the whole collection to PSA Vault and have them take care of everything? Or should I sift through all the cards and sort what I believe to be valuable, then ship those to PSA Vault? And then sell those \"junk\" cards in bulk on eBay? I just want to make sure I am getting the most amount of money from this collection. I looked through the PSA Vault eBay store, and I see that there are some cards of not-so-famous players selling for a $20+ per card. Please go easy on this ignorant fella, just trying to get rid of old items, thank you LOL. Edit: This collection is from 20+ years ago. All raw cards, no graded. Cards from 80s, 90s, and early 2000s.

I presented strong evidence that burgerchu was only being held up by shill bidding, and that when volume pressure (constant PSA vault auction lots of 200+ slabs at once) forced the shill bidders to stop, price would tank and not stop tanking. I had thought an initial floor of $100, but looking at future auctions there are only more and more huge lots coming. When the dust settles, I wonder how many people think that buying these en masse at ~$50 would be a better use of capital than other cards. The card does have a more interesting “story” behind it and will be memorable going into the future, but the signs were clear that buying at 200 or even 300-400+ like many did was a terrible move in the present.",

Problem is it pays and auto-ships in 3 days and don't want it shipped (plus I would be charged tax and a shipping fee). Card is around $100. Anybody experience this before?",

          "text": "Ebay Sent Card to Wrong PSA Vault Email I purchased a card on ebay to send to PSA vault. I do this all the time seamlessly. However, one card has been stuck on \"shipped to PSA vault\" for a long time, and I have not received the confirmation that the card is \"Vaulted\" by PSA. The other problem is that this card never said \"To Vault\" in the PSA app like most cards to when in transit, though it did automatically appear in my collection. I contacted PSA about this issue and they gave me a canned response saying that the card is indeed secured in the vault, but attached to the wrong email. They suggest I make an account to link ebay to PSA, but I have obviously already done that. I used the same ebay email and everything (which is done automatically) that I always do, this cannot possibly be my fault. I'm waiting on their response, but this does not seem promising. Anyone else experience something like this?",

Just been digging into Courtyard as a useful comparison with GameStop's new Power Packs/PSA launch. So by way of background, Courtyard (\\[dot\\] io - not sure if I can post a link to it here) is an existing collectibles platform which has been around for from what I can tell just over 7 months. Auctioning a [quarter of a million dollar Charizard](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/12/06/rare-250k-charizard-pokemon-card-going-on-auction-this-friday/) on their platform seems to have been their first big go at publicity from what I can tell and only this week they raised $30 million in a Series A funding round. Here's what they have to say about themselves on a job ad: >Courtyard is the fastest-growing collectibles startup, ever. We are revolutionizing the world of collectibles trading by enabling instant liquidity and delivering a high-velocity, immersive experience. From trading cards to comics, we’re redefining how people discover, collect, and unlock value. >Courtyard is not just another marketplace. All assets are securely vaulted and fully insured, giving collectors peace of mind alongside unmatched speed and simplicity. Whether you’re investing, discovering, or curating your dream collection, we’ve built a platform that’s trusted, simple, and built for speed. >And we’re just getting started. We’re a remote-first company hiring across all functions to push the boundaries of what’s possible in collectibles and digital ownership. Anyway, so like our new platform, they let their customers buy, sell, and trade physical trading cards, comics etc. through their online platform. And it’s growing fast. This year, transaction volume hit 95,000 per day, and in February alone they reported $42.6 million in sales volume. They’ve reported $9 million in revenue and raised $37.1 million total in funding, including the $30 million Series A round previously mentioned. Their model is",

          "text": "Imagine a GameStop Kiosk That Instantly Grades Cards What if GameStop partnered even deeper with PSA and built AI powered grading kiosks directly in stores? You walk in, insert your Pokémon, MTG, or sports card into a secure machine, and within minutes it’s scanned, graded by AI, slabbed in store, and added to your GameStop wallet on the blockchain! No mailing. No waiting weeks. No worrying about damage or fakes. No middlemen. Think about what that unlocks: * Instant grading using high-res imaging and machine learning to assess centering, corners, edges, and surface * Secure encapsulation (slabbed right in front of you) * Real-time blockchain registration - card is in your account and verified on-chain * You could trade, sell, or vault it the same day through GameStop's marketplace or wallet This solves multiple pain points in the collectibles space: 1. Grading delays and shipping risk 2. Trust and transparency in card condition 3. Difficulty onboarding casual collectors into the ecosystem It’s also a massive opportunity for GameStop: * Increased physical foot traffic from a new customer segment * Recurring kiosk revenue (grading fees, encapsulation, etc.) * Onboarding costumers into their Web3 wallet ecosystem through a real, tangible asset not speculative JPEGs * Tying all of this into a collectible trading platform would instantly set them apart from eBay and Whatnot No, they aren’t doing this yet. But the pieces are there: * GameStop already partnered with PSA * They’ve built blockchain rails and a wallet which they could easily bring back * They’re sitting on thousands of stores that could house these kiosks * And the collectibles market is still red hot, especially among younger collectors People are still sleeping on how big the trading card market is, and how broken the grading experience still is in 2025. Whoever solves it in a streamlined, tech-forward way is going to own the space. GameStop could literally be first to do it at scale. Just imagine: AI grad",

          "text": "PSA Vault Review Pros and Cons !! Hello everyone, I know there was a post a couple months back on getting started using the vault, but I wanted to give my in depth review along with some big pros and cons that you may not be aware of if you arent an active user. I have most of my collection stored there and have been using it pretty much since it started up. Hope this helps some people. The Good: * One of their biggest selling points on the vault is being tax free, since it is located in DE. If you withdrawal early you will still have to pay a fee, but it is negligble compared to the taxes you would pay on high end cards. After 90 days of being vaulted you don't pay this fee. * You can receive cash offers from within their PSA network. Zero fees with immediate payment. The offers can range from laughable lowballs, but occassionaly you might get a really strong one at 90-100% market. For reference I have only accepted two offers this way. From what I understand the \"network\" is mostly businesses trying to obtain inventory, I am guessing they have to pay some sort of subscription/prove they are an actual business to join, but Idk. If someone here is part of it and has more insight would love to know. * You can change listings in real time. This market is changing faster than ever and extremely volatile. If you have sent a consignment with BIN pricing other places, that same price may not hold up by the time it is listed, not an issue with the vault. * You can ship directly from your vault to a private buyer. * For older Certs they will give you the high res scan if one dosent already exist. * Liability is not on you anymore. I know many of yall have sweated watching the tracking of something sent out, Ik I have. * They also provide really convenient data with recent solds, may not always be 100% up to date or accurate approximations of value, but can be helpful as a starting point in figuring out how to price. * The fees are cheaper than selling a card by yourself on ",

          "text": "PSA lost vault card purchased on eBay. Reimbursement offered is under purchase price. EDIT: They are “now” reimbursing full value. TLDR: I bought a rare, low pop slab already in the vault from PSA on eBay for $830. PSA lost it en route to me when I “withdrew” it from the vault the same day. They are now only offering $500 due to comps in the form of a check or credits. Apparently my own comp of $830 is not sufficient. PSA can up charge us all day for card values and what not, yet when it’s time to payout for loss, they’re stingy. My problem with this is the disconnect between eBay and PSA in a short amount of time. I understand the two entities are separate and provide different services, but when they are so heavily advertised as being a seamless experience, it should be handled differently. To preface, I’ve sold AND bought dozens if not now over a hundred items back and forth to the vault and through eBay authentication. I’ve either bought/sold a slab directly in the vault, or had something shipped from the seller/myself to the vault to save on taxes. This is the first time I’ve ever had an issue. I understand that when something is held in the vault for a while, it may rise or diminish based on current comps, but when something was withdrawn from the vault on the same day of purchase from eBay, I think that should be handled differently. Had I purchased something shipped directly from a seller or even in the case of the authenticators, eBay would have reimbursed me the full amount, which I’ve already had happen before. In this case where the sale was initiated on eBay, but the loss was WITH PSA, I am screwed with a comp $330 less than my purchase price, and apparently my own comp is not sufficient.",

I won an auction for this card (a little over $100), seller being PSA and the card listed as being in the PSA vault. That was 2 weeks ago. I originally messaged because it had been like 4 days and never moved from paid to shipped, and they responded quickly and just said it has not been shipped but should arrive within the window of time. Now it is well past the window with no update (2 weeks). I have messaged 3 more times over this last week with no response. I opened a case with EBay that the item has not arrived. Funny thing is I won 2 other PSA auctions around the same time and both of those were processed and shipped normally. IDK if there is anything to be done at this point. EBay says they will step in on April 1. I’m guessing this ends with me just getting a refund but I want to know what BS is going on PSA / PSA Vaults end? Like did they lose this persons card and now can’t complete the sale and just went dark? Or does the original owner that had it in the vault have to OK the sale? I left negative feedback but obviously that is no real repercussion for them.",

One month earlier, GameStop became an authorized PSA dealer. Ryan Cohen’s board is tight and hand-picked. You don’t get a seat for a dealer agreement. Turner receives no compensation for his board role. He’s the CEO of a company valued at $4.3 billion, sitting on GameStop’s board for free. **Why?** Because when this deal closes, he’ll be one of the largest GameStop shareholders. ----- ##What is Collectors Holdings? Collectors has quietly consolidated the entire collectibles authentication industry: |Brand |Category |Position | |-------|----------------------|-----------------------------| |PSA |Trading cards |#1 globally, 71% market share| |SGC |Trading cards |Acquired Feb 2024 | |Beckett|Trading cards & comics|Acquired Dec 2025 | |PCGS |Coins & currency |Industry leader | |WATA |Video games |Industry leader | |Goldin |Auction marketplace |Premium collectibles | According to GemRate, PSA graded 18.3+ million cards in 2025. **Combined with SGC and Beckett, Collectors now owns 79% of all card grading.** They don’t dominate the market.

I'm a 47-year-old sales rep from Houston who spends half his life in airports and bouncing between client meetings. I've got maybe eight cards in my wallet—credit, debit, hotel keys, transit passes. A buddy of mine got his card skimmed at Hobby Airport last year, and someone cloned it. $1,200 in fraudulent charges before the bank caught it. That got me paranoid. I kept seeing ads for this Guardality Safe Card popping up, so I went down the rabbit hole of Googling \"Guardality Safe Card Protection reviews complaints consumer reports\" to see if it was legit or just another piece of plastic that does nothing. **Does It Work?** I couldn't find a formal \"Consumer Reports\" test on RFID blockers, so I grabbed one to test it myself. **Short Answer: Yes, but you have to understand it's about the material, not magic.** It uses advanced RFID-blocking technology—basically a metallic layer inside the card that creates a Faraday cage effect . When you place it next to your contactless cards, it disrupts the electromagnetic signals that scanners use to steal your data . **The Feeling:** The card itself is ultra-slim—about the thickness of a regular credit card, maybe 1.1mm . You slide it into your wallet next to your cards and honestly? You forget it's there. No bulk, no weight. That's the point. **The Test:** I was skeptical, so I did a real-world test. Before using Guardality, I held my work badge (which has RFID) up to the reader at my office—beep, instant access. Then I put the Guardality card behind it and tried again. **Nothing.** Dead silence. The reader couldn't detect it at all. That's when I knew the shielding was real . I've been carrying this in my wallet for the last month everywhere—airports, grocery stores, crowded stadiums. * **Peace of Mind:** The biggest win. I don't flinch anymore when someone stands close to me in line. * **Func",

I’ve pulled out my old binder from childhood and think there’s potential value in these nine cards. I quickly checked a US price chart website for the holo cards I have, but all the prices are in US dollars. The central card seems like it might be worth a bit, but there appear to be two versions. Mine doesn’t have the Japanese text, but I’m struggling to find a good UK price. What’s the best way to sell these and price them correctly? I’m in the UK and was thinking maybe eBay is the only option, or should I try to find an event nearby to take these to? Anything else I should look for to ensure what I have are legitimate? E.g. the Pichu card seems to be a lighter shade of blue on the back bs the others? Thanks! Edit: Ok... thank you Reddit! This is kind of mad... I genuinely thought I might get some feedback of having a few hundred pounds there and just stick them on Ebay, not quite the scale some people are now suggesting. will be buying some sleeves and \"top loaders\" asap! I'm also sticking to the advice of ignoring my DMs for selling these for now until I understand what I'm actually sitting on.",

Now that's a pretty limited run these days. Well surfing the net and watching some YouTube vids has shown me that Backyard Breaks had 50 cases, or 10% of the entire print run. Filthbomb was given a similar allocation, so now we are at about 20% of the print run without factoring in a single other breaker that gets allocation from Fanatics. Single boxes are so limited on the secondary market that they are going for 5x. There are a grand total of 23 available to purchase on eBay at the time I'm writing this. Call me a doomer - I don't really give a shit - but this is why you couldn't get Black & White or Bob Ross. And when you cant get those, and you don't want to pay 5x guess where you're gonna go - to the breakers. EQL or not, this is why these products are sold out in less than 5 minutes. Get used to only buying low end products or be a part of the problem and feed the breakers. When I can't get my hands on a case of Platinum Chrome Anniversary Fanatics I will officially be 100% vintage. Good luck everybody.",

          "text": "Jimmy's Pokemon Deal Finder - A site that finds deals on Pokemon cards on eBay A few years ago, I got into Pokemon collecting, and I'd look for good deals on cards on eBay. For each card I was interested in, I'd search the card on PriceCharting and compare the listing price to the valuation from PriceCharting. I found this really slow and tedious so wanted a way to automate it. I wrote an eBay scraper and PriceCharting scraper in Python that would show listings from eBay where the listing price was lower than the PriceCharting value. It output the best deals to a text file sorted by price different percent so I could see the best deals. This worked really well and I used it for a while to get some good cards. A few years later, I'd been making programming projects for my personal website and decided to turn the deal finder script into a website. Site: https://www.jimmysdealfinder.com I got it working and posted it to the Pokemon TCG subreddits and had really good foodback on it (as well as some fair criticism that I've used to improve the site). I monetized it with eBay affiliate links and I'm now making about £200 a month from the site, with a peak month of £530 a couple of months ago. I'm really happy with how it's come along, and people seem to be actually using the site to find good deals. I get about 25 users a day and the average engagement time is around 2-3 minutes. I'm planning to expand it to other collectibles such as retro video games, Magic the Gathering TCG, Yugioh, and sports cards. Let me know if you check it out and have any feedback or ideas to improve the site. :)",

The more I’ve watched this product get ripped, the more it feels like certain formats, especially Breaker’s Delight, are disproportionately landing bigger hits. We’ve seen some truly absurd cases (looking at you u/blezsportscards). That got me wondering whether the numbers themselves could help validate or challenge that perception across both hobby and retail SKUs. **How I approached this:** Instead of focusing on per-box averages, I asked a different question: How many boxes of each format does it take to pull a “rare hit”? I looked at two buckets: 1) **Low-numbered parallels (≤50 copies)** This includes Gold, Orange, Black, Red, Super, and Frozenfractor parallels, along with those same parallels of Basketballs, Pulsars, Raywaves, and Geometrics. I also included Image Variation and Auto parallels numbered /50 or less. I understand there are meaningful hits numbered higher than 50 (ex: Flagg Blue Auto /150, Flagg Green Image Variation /99), but those apply to only a handful of players and don’t materially change format-level dynamics. 2) **Case Hit or tougher inserts** These include Rock Stars, Let’s Go!, Ultra Violet, Radiating Rookies, Helix, Lightboard Logos, Hidden Gems, Advisory, Glass Canvas, Paradox, Patented, Fanatical, Finals, and Gold Logomen. Using published odds, I can calculate the frequencies of low-numbered parallels and Case Hits without much trouble. What I cannot account for is name distribution. Odds don’t tell us which players land in which formats. If 90% of Gold Cooper Flagg autos are seeded into Jumbos, I can't help you there. The only way to know that is by watching rips. **Quick side note:** Some base Geometric insert and auto parallels are insanely rare. If the published odds are accurate (which I assume is the case because they are consistent), base Geometric parallels of co",

First, the inventory doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be. Second, if anything is good it is often over priced trying to drive you to sellers web age. Third, if I do find what looks to be a decent auction I always seem to lose as \"second highest bidder\". This last one happens so often now it has to be something fishy (even though I don't have proof). I also used to frequent the CGC forum's, inventory also seems scarce there. Are people just sitting on big books because market is down? I know about ComicLink, MyComicShop, and Heritage but would prefer more eBay style auctions. I personally hate social media so don't do Instagram, or whatnot. The later I can't stand you can barely inspect the book before someone buys. I want good pictures, not someone holding it in front of a camera for 5 seconds telling me what the grade is. I want a chance to grade it myself. I just tried FB Marketplace but frankly good stuff is rare where I live. Am I missing someplace, where did all the eBay buyers/sellers go? Feels like the online market is splintered and while I hated eBay for fees, it was a pretty safe place for buyers and it was kind of nice almost everyone/thing was there.",

Before we get any of the standard \"but...\" comments, this is for a specific set of people, if your not one of them, thats great I still hope you learn something. What You Will Need: 1. GB/GBC Pokemon Repro Cart (Haven't worked with gen 3 yet) The one your looking for usually has a 2017 on the back of the board (seen easiest on crystal) You'll know you have one if the game freezes and the music stops for more then 5 seconds when trying to save. 2. Soldering Iron and the skill to use it (Seriously burns suck) 3. Gameboy Cart Flasher (Tested this method with the GBX and \"Flash Boy\") 4. CR2025/CR1616 Batteries (Tabbed) (Tape and wire if you are working on gen 2, as the 2025 batteries are larger than the board tabs) 5. Rom of the game (Obtained however). What We're Doing: We are trying to remove as much \"jank\" from these as possible to make them more playable and accessible to anyone who either doesn't want to sell a kidney, wants to get a copy of green working, or just wants more copies to trade/hunt on. We will be soldering a battery to the board, and flashing the proper rom, so it will properly use the battery and SRAM (This will work with FRAM too, this is just not the guide for it.) Let's Do It! : 1. Solder the new battery to the board, (For Gen 2 you will need to solder wires and tape down your battery). 2. Clean the board, you never know how dirty the rom and ram chips can get, and pop it into your flasher. 3. Flash your game and test it, save the game and reset to see if it holds, if it did congrats you have a fully working game with much less jank and didn't have to sell a kidney. Questions I Expect To Hear (If this post stays up): 1. Why not just use FRAM? You can I prefer the authentic feel of the original gen 1/2 games with the time limits of the batteries, and have the tools to replace them. If you would prefer FRAM, follow a guide on youtube as your not alone, and people have done it before. 2. How do I m",

          "text": "Who’s in the wrong here? (Card show drama) I was at the Dallas card show last weekend, and on the last day, I spotted a card I really wanted for my personal collection. Before I made an offer, I overheard the vendor telling a friend that he hadn’t sold much at all he’d mostly been buying and he was complaining about there being too many flippers and not enough true collectors at the show. The card itself wasn’t super expensive, but it was an RPA of a player most people have forgotten, and I love collecting him. These cards rarely pop up, so despite the vendor being about $130 over the last comp, I still agreed to pay his price. I even offered him a trade, where I’d give him a much more liquid (and more valuable) card in exchange for his, but he valued my card at only half of what it was worth while he was still charging about 75% over comps for his own. Ultimately, I just decided to pay cash outright. We shook hands, and as I started counting out the money, he said, “You know what, seeing how much you want this card, I think I should just keep it.” I was in disbelief. I even tried to pay his full sticker price, which was $15 higher than our agreed amount, but he still refused to sell it. As I was walking away, I said, “I guess that’s why your case is still full.” He got really upset and accused me of taking a cheap shot as I left. I told him he was just being fragile, and he fired back that I was mad I didn’t get my way. I pointed out that we had a deal how was I not getting my way when we’d already agreed on a price? Things got a bit heated, but we ended up just going our separate ways. I just don’t know why you set up at a card show and someone’s offering you way more than you would get on eBay after fees and you still won’t sell a card no one wanted all weekend. Then get mad when someone points out your behavior as a reason as to why you haven’t sold anything. I think the guy needed a wakeup call. I don’t regret anything I said.",

It is going through Ebay's authenticity guarantee verification per the normal process, my question is does anyone know what will happen? Will PSA still authenticate the slab and seal it with an authenticate sticker, will they send it back to the seller, or send it to me the buyer without the sticker saying they can't authenticate? I understand there is no way they will authenticate the signature, which is fine I don't really care. But will they authenticate the slab and card itself? If anyone knows please let me know, being the idiot I am, only thought about this after I paid, and the slab already enroute to PSA authentication. Thank you",

          "text": "eBay Authentication discarded my lawful accessories without clear consent — seller didn’t opt in I’m posting this as a heads-up to other sellers, not a rant. I sold an authentic designer handbag on eBay. The bag itself passed eBay Authentication with no issue. I did not request authentication — the transaction was automatically routed into the Authenticity Guarantee program by eBay / the buyer. Along with the bag, I shipped handmade leather replacement straps. These were: not counterfeit not branded lawful personal property packaged separately disclosed as non-original accessories After authentication, I was notified that while the bag passed, the handmade straps would be discarded and not returned to me. At no point during listing or checkout was there a clear, prominent disclosure that lawful accessories could be destroyed without compensation. There was no checkbox, warning screen, or affirmative acknowledgment explaining that this could happen. Any reference appears to be buried in fine-print terms. I understand authenticators removing non-original items from the shipment — but permanently discarding seller property without a return option (even at seller’s expense) feels like a disclosure and consent problem. I’m sharing this so other sellers know: Do not include replacement or handmade accessories with items routed to authentication Even if they’re legal and disclosed, they may be discarded You may not have opted into authentication, but you’re still bound by its terms",

          "text": "Sent a $600+ Pokemon card to eBay Authenticator in USPS Priority Small box, they sent it back in a beat up bubble mailer. Is this normal? I’m looking for some insight from anyone who has received a card from eBay’s Authenticity Guarantee. I sold a high-value raw Pokemon card ($600+) and took every precaution shipping it to the authenticator. I used a USPS Priority Mail small box, lined with foam and packing paper, with the card securely protected in a sleeve and card saver between two foam pieces. The card was rejected for \"Listing Accuracy.\" While I understand their standards are strict, I feel the need to specify that I didn't hide anything about this card. I specifically called out a small surface dimple on the back border in the description and included a dedicated close-up photo of it. When it arrived yesterday, the mailer was torn and had visible punctures. Even worse, the inspector’s notes were contradictory: they verified the card is 100% authentic, but then added a note saying \"please update your listing to reflect that the card is altered.\" I pulled this card from a pack myself and have not modified it. I'm not sure I understand why they believe it was altered. Maybe because they didn't like the small surface dimple, but I had already disclosed in the listing. It seems okay upon first look, but I'm stressed that a $600 card was treated so carelessly by the people paid to protect the transaction. A few questions for the group: 1. Is it normal for eBay to basically downgrade shipping from a box to a mailer on returns? 2. Has anyone else had a pack-fresh card labeled \"altered\" by an eBay authenticator? 3. If I find any damage upon closer inspection, what is the best way to hold eBay/the authenticator accountable since they discarded my original protective packaging? Appreciate any advice or shared experiences.",

Since I’m charging the buyer extra for the signature. Second question: I know the authenticity badge shows next to the shipping section once the item is posted, but can I see this badge on my draft while I’m writing the description?

          "text": "eBay authentication issue I recently purchased an Omega watch on eBay with the Authenticity Guarantee. The listing explicitly included multiple (3) strap options and an OEM stainless bracelet, which was one of the main reasons I bought this specific watch at the price I paid. The watch just went through authenticity this morning. eBay confirmed that the watch itself is authentic, but flagged a “listing accuracy issue” and stated that the additional strap and bracelet couldn’t be verified and would not be included in the shipment. They gave me the option to accept it without the additional strap and bracelet, or receive a full refund. The problem is that if I want to accept it and just buy a replacement bracelet and strap, just based on a quick search, looks like it’ll be $600-700. So by accepting it, I’m basically overpaying for just the watch head and one strap. Has anyone else had eBay authentication remove things that were clearly shown and described in the listing? Did you accept the item, return it, or get a price adjustment? This is my first time buying from eBay so I’d appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance",

My feedback is great as a buyer but basically non-existent as a seller. The buyer is on the other side of the country so I can't deliver in person. The card is graded and slabbed, but won't go through the eBay authentication process. My thoughts-- please tell me if I should do anything different: 1) Accept the offer 2) Video of myself packing the card at Fedex, every step of the way -- including the tracking number-- and never having focus off the card. 3) Sending it for the full insured amount -- overnight (overkill?) with signature required. Is there anything else I'm not considering? I'm worried about all sorts of things. The buyer has feedback over 60 and 100% and has been an eBay member for almost 20 years.",

I purchased a trading card for ~$1800. Authentication Guarantee was a part of this. At some point in the process there were some damaging depressions made in the card. These damages were very clearly not there in the seller’s photos, but were present when it was delivered to me. This is a one-of-a-kind card, so there is no possible dubious swapping going on. Ebay has suggested essentially that I relist and sell the card in an auction on the site, and that they would reimburse me for the differences in what I paid and the proceeds from the sale. They will not allow me to just return the card. Has anyone else ever experienced this? It just seems odd to me, and I question whether I can trust eBay to follow through with their side of this. How they’ve treated this so far, I don’t feel confident in their processes. EDIT: upon re-reading their recent message, they’re actually only offering to reimburse me for the fees to resell it. Which is definitely a lose-lose situation for me.",

          "text": "Very important rule for EBay buying If you purchase a bag that is final sale but authenticity guaranteed, do not assume the money back guarantee will cover you. For example, my bag had damage that I was not contacted about. When I tried to get a return, they said no because the authenticity guarantee finalizes the final sale. When I questioned their mistake, they said their team doesn’t make mistakes and said my pictures were too blurry to tell if there was damage. The pictures weren’t blurry and you could clearly see damage. I filed a chargeback and they told my credit card company they were willing to take it back, but I wouldn’t return it. I have 3 messages from reps saying no I couldn’t return it. So here I sit in limbo land hoping I didn’t get scammed out of $700 from EBay. From EBay “What buyers need to know about returns Some purchases inspected under Authenticity Guarantee are considered final sale. eBay Money Back Guarantee does not cover final sale purchases on the basis that the item doesn't match the listing. Returns for final sale purchases are only eligible for coverage under eBay Money Back Guarantee when: The item was damaged during shipping, or The seller doesn't honor their stated returns policy”",

I did. The seller, in the original listing, wrote: \"Houndoom H11/H32 Aquapolis Holo **in near perfect condition**. Kept in binder with minimal light exposure, minor curling due to age... **Card has almost no signs of wear**, only things a grader would look for. Definitely a great collector's item, looking to get rid of quickly.\" Evidently, his statements weren't true. Thankfully eBay intercepted this for me. Attached photos from communication by eBay (email/app), and eBay listing shots Just thought I'd share. Kind of feel a bit better buying a card this way, than from a less protected medium like OfferUp or Mercari.

For context about a month ago I had a buyer who bought 2 of my items which was one of my biggest mistakes as this dude went on to try and feedback extort me and so much more and was just a massive hassle, It's now a month later and the dude randomly gave me negative feedback on the other order he bought which was a simple Sylveon Masterball Pattern Pokemon card which I sold to him UNDER MARKET at 16$ where it's currently sitting on TCGPlayer at 27$ in that condition *(* [*Sylveon (Master Ball Pattern) - SV: Prismatic Evolutions - Pokemon - TCGplayer.com*](https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/610664/pokemon-sv-prismatic-evolutions-sylveon-master-ball-pattern?Language=English&Condition=Near+Mint&page=1) *)* It's best if you read the messages it'll explain itself lmao. **Buyer(Leaves review):** *\"Not a great value\"* **Me:** *\"I'm sorry was there something wrong with your order? \"Not of value\" isn't a reason to give negative feedback you knew what you we're buying and you chose to purchase it for that price just because you probably assumed it would go up in value and it didn't isn't grounds for negative feedback\"* **Buyer:** *\"Why don't you relax. It was overpriced as hell\" \"Ur feedback is garbage already fam\" \"Not my fault it was a bad value is it? Don't sell overpriced garbage\"* **Me:** *\"If it was \"overpriced\" then why'd you buy it Imao, nothing about it is \"overpriced❞ either Imao market value according to TCGplayer pulling sales from ebay put it at 26 which is far above the price you paid for it dude js wanted to be petty bcz he couldn't resell it Imao\" \"Imagine leaving irrelevant feedback a month later because you decided you willingly paid more than you wanted to go ahead nd tell me what about it is \"not of value\" unless there's some physical defect that falls under INAD your feedback goes against Ebays policies Imao\"* **Buyer:** \"Blocked!\" P.S.

Spent days on end tinkering, trying apps, setting up launchers, getting meta data, installing apps and pushing the thing as far as I can with HD packs and the like. The thing is, now I have pretty much everything up and running, I find myself not really using it. I think I enjoyed the tinkering and problem solving of getting things to run, such as gamehub/ gamenative games, project Zomdriod, the 3ds HD packs and Wii U controls for Mario Galaxy. Now most things either run well or I've hit a wall where they aren't likely to according to various community sources, I find myself going to play something much as Pokemon ZA on Eden or FF Crisis Core on Gamenative and end up just switching to my MSI Claw, Switch 2 or PS5/ PS Portal as generally the MSI handles emulation better or being Windows can just run the games without needing emulation and obviously the PS5 and Switch 2 play things without issue. I love the duel screens, but at nearly 44, outside of nds, wii U or 3ds, I don't really use both unless I'm reading a guide while trying to sort something out as I don't have the brain power to play a game and actually take in anything in a meaningful way other than what's on the top screen without pausing. So I'm wondering, now the tinkering is done, is it worth hanging onto for anything outside of 3DS emulation and smaller form factor than my Claw. The prices for them on Ebay here in the UK are going for around the price I paid for it or more and I'm just worried that now I don't seem to be using as much, it will decrease in value as the batches get shipped out and I'll lose money if I decide to part with it in the near future. Anyone have any hot takes to talk me into/ out of selling?",

I have good service status with 100 % and it has been confirmed from a capable supporter a month ago that my status is not the issue. ebay does this randomly. when I call the hotline the person is so clueless they don't even know what ebay is doing and I have to repeatedly explain to them, who supposedly are experts, that my issue is general and not specific to a certain sale. the support quality is so low it is not funny. it is not that I do not get what ebay does here, but there is zero transparancy, the supporters aren't informed, there is no time line, no outlook. on top of course the system does not work, meaning usually at least one item hangs where supposedly everything went well, but ebay still recognizes it as not ready for payout. this post got removed without any reasoning from the main ebay sub.",

A chunk of them - buying and selling - have been on eBay, but it seems like I am the only one that has to follow the rules on that platform. When I send in an offer on a BIN price, I get a pop up that tells me exactly how much my credit card will be charged if the offer is accepted. The moment a seller accepts it, my card gets charged and the transaction is finalized. However, more and more frequently of late, someone will send me an offer on a BIN listing that I have up, I will accept it and..... nothing. It just sits in limbo. It's not listed under the \"Awaiting Payment\" section but, if I go to manage offers, I see it's listed as \"pending\" and has a grayed out \"awaiting payment\" logo next to the price. Nothing ever happens and that's it. No sale. On auctions, when I bid on something, I also get a popup telling me what I will be paying, and that all bids are binding. The auction ends and, if I win, my card gets charged a couple hours later and that's it. Deal is done. However, when I set up my own auctions, people will bid on my item, win the auction and..... nothing. No payment. Nothing. It just sits there. I've had this happen six times in my last forty auctions. I even have the settings in my seller dashboard to restrict people with \"non-payment\" marks from bidding on my items. I do not want them..... yet I always seem to find them. How is it that all my bids and offers are \"FINAL\" and everyone else's seem not to be? Are there more settings that I'm missing? Does eBay just not give a shit?",

They made $14,000 in sales (after eBay fees, before cost of goods). My bank account was linked but eBay never paid out. eBay suspended my account in January 2026 before any payout. **Current situation:** \\- $14,000 in sales (Dec 2025) \\- Account suspended (Jan 2026) \\- Funds still held by eBay \\- Never received a single penny in my bank account \\- Friend says he can't pay me and will only pay \"once eBay releases the funds\" \\- Research shows eBay can hold funds 180+ days on suspended accounts **Questions**: 1. Do I owe taxes on the $14,000 for 2025 even though I never received the money? 2. How do I handle this on my tax return when the funds are still held? 3. What if eBay never releases the funds? I don't have invoices for cost of goods (friend was supposed to provide them but hasn't). I'm in Canada if that matters. I'm really stressed about owing taxes on money I never got.

Klarna has been giving me an ID Verification error on any purchase I try to make in the app. So I thought if I just put $200 into my Klarna balance I should be able to spend that with no problem in the app. I was wrong. I added the card to my Apple Wallet and tried to pay that way (for a PAY NOW purcase in the Klarna app for an ebay gift card) and it says \"We cannot process your card.\" So I tried using the actual Klarna debit card # for the purcahse and I get the same error. I don't see a way to choose KLARNA BALANCE at checkout. But I show a $200 balance in my account. So now I don't have the $200 in my bank account anymore AND Klarna won't let me spend it. What is going on?! How can I buy a freaking gift card in their app?!? I have been on chat hold for almost 24 hours waiting for a supervisor about the ongoing ID Verification problem.

NOW a guy just bought 3 cards after the change and he paid $3.96 for shipping and we are left with a $6.37 label and make the difference in cost. how can we fix this?",

I am very NeuroDivergent A Lair of Disappointment: How Wizards of the Coast’s Botched Secret Lair Drop Became a Scalper’s Paradise Byline: Jonathan Fink Date: October 19, 2025 For thousands of Magic: The Gathering fans, Monday, October 13th, was a day marked by anticipation. It was the launch of the \"Secret Scare Superdrop,\" a highly sought-after collection of premium, limited-edition card sets. But within minutes, that anticipation devolved into a now-familiar ritual of frustration, futility, and fury. Customers who logged on at the 9 a.m. PST launch were thrust into a virtual queue, with wait times ticking into hours. The most agonizing part, however, wasn't the wait. It was the false hope. Multiple players reported the same crushing experience: after finally getting through the queue two hours later, they would successfully add the desired $40 bundles to their cart. They would proceed to checkout, enter their payment and shipping details, and click \"confirm.\" Only then would they be met with an error message: the items were sold out. Their carts were empty. The product had been sold from under them while they were typing in their credit card number. This \"cart jac",

We all see ebays popups saying \"lower your handling time to 1 day\" to get a theoretical increase in sales and I believe its required to get TRS rated. Anyhow, there are several times where I will often ship within an hour or 2 of getting the item sold notice - full product packaged for shipping, label printed, attached, and dropped off at the post office and off it goes. Ive seen people discussing accepting ebay offers on their listed items but getting a payment failed notice. Does it ever happen for auctions or BIN item sales? If so, what happens if you've already shipped the order and then a day or 2 later while the funds are stuck in processing - you get a payment failed notice. Will ebay cover the payment and go after the buyer?",

I have been selling some of my things on my Ebay account to assist me with my bills recently. However, this morning Ebay put my payouts on hold while my account has a 'periodic review'. I spoke with Ebay customer service today and they told me that this review started because I had a noticeable increase in the amount I have sold lately & that it was a standard review. Ebay customer service said it would take likely 5 business days at minimum to finish this review and have my account hold lifted so that I can receive my funds. Since I am in need of these funds now to pay my bills, I am hoping that someone would be willing to loan me the money needed for my bills, and then I could repay them after my account hold is lifted. I am requesting two weeks to pay back the funds as I need to wait at least 5 days for my funds to be released from my Ebay hold and then I will need to have the funds transferred from Ebay to my bank account, which can take another 3-5 days. (Two weeks allows me the time needed plus a few ",

Here’s how to sell smartly: Step 1: Pick Your Platform For speed: Try CardSell (app) or eBay (auction-style, but fees eat profits). For max value: Negotiate P2P (OfferUp, Craigslist). Insist on secure payment (Zelle/Venmo only after verification). Safe trade: Reddit’s r/giftcardexchange or r/GCTrading(Always check the trust and scam lists) Step 2: Price It Right Physical cards fetch 5-10% more than e-codes. Bulk discounts? GiftCardBin buys large quantities (e.g., corporate leftovers). Step 3: Safety Checks Never share PINs before payment. Use escrow services (like Bisq for crypto-minded folks). Fun Fact: Some charities accept gift cards as donations (tax deductible!). What’s your horror story or surprise win? Let’s commiserate/celebrate below.",

Lately I’ve been noticing some random delays with my ebay payouts even though not super frequent but enough to be annoying. Sometimes it’s flagged for review sometimes it just takes longer than usual for no clear reason. I made a couple changes to try and smooth it out. One thing that seemed to help was switching to a US based account fron Adro banking that can receive ACH and wires directly. Since doing that I think things have felt a bit more stable and I think it’s made my seller profile look a bit more established to the platform. I also started reviewing my return policy and shipping settings to see if anything there might be triggering hold ups especially for new buyers. Cleaned up some of my product listings too just made them a bit more US market friendly with clearer shipping times and localized pricing. Still figuring it all out though. Curious if others have run into the same issues. Is this just part of the game, or are there things you’ve done to reduce the friction with payouts?",

Mythic rares and rares often command higher prices,especially if they are staples in popular constructed formats like Standard,Modern,or Commander. However, if a set as a whole is not highly sought after, even these rarer cards can end up in clearance bins.

Hi everyone, I recently started an eBay dropshipping store and quickly realized how painful the reconciliation process is. eBay gives me payouts, and I need to match them with every single supplier transaction. But the supplier side often has delays or missing entries, and manual reconciliation is super time-consuming and error-prone. To save time, I built an automated system that parses and analyzes both sides and flags discrepancies or missing data. It’s made my life a lot easier. Here is the screenshot: [EBay payout screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/qtX4Q7D) I'm curious: * Are you facing the same problem? * Would you consider paying a monthly subscription for a tool that automates this process? * What features would be a must-have for you?

My apologies if this situation is common for most of you. The seller in question is small. Only 15 items sold and 6 current listings. Among them are a few comics valued between $40-80 each. I won at auction the most valuable of these comics for under $30. Seller then cancelled and refunded payment due to “missing or damaged item.” They then preceded to re-list for auction that same comic, but this time with a starting price double what I just paid. They didn’t even wait a few days! They put the book I won back up for auction immediately after claiming they’d lost it and couldn’t honor my win. I’m so sick of stuff like this. I’d never think of treating my buyers like this. I’ve only been buying and selling for a few months now, and this is the third time something like this happened. I reported it this time cause it was so brazen and insulting. Does anyone know if eBay takes these complaints seriously? It’s upsetting that I can’t leave feedback on this exchange. Seller only has a 89% rating with only 15 sales though. So I’m not the first person they’ve screwed with. Sorry. Rant over. That item has been on my list for years now. I was excited. Now I’ve got emotional whiplash and I’m trying to avoid going to bed angry. Thank you to anyone who read this far. I hope you’re getting a better site experience than I have lately. EDIT: Whoa. This blew up a bit. So sorry I haven’t responded to you all. I’ve been on the road for work and didn’t think this would generate so much discussion. I’m grateful to everyone here, and I did manage to find a way to leave feedback eventually. Took me till 3am to figure out how, but I was motivated. And I’ll definitely be checking out seller reviews more thoroughly in the future. Thank you everyone.",

          "text": "Does eBay always hold funds? Does eBay always hold funds for sellers? I thought after 30 or 90 days they don’t hold the funds until 3 days after order delivery? Here was my response from eBay when asked about it. I have 100% seller feedback and 44 sales for a total of around $7,400 in around 100 days. Just making sure this is true and not a line of BS. From what I have read, holds are only supposed to happen for 30 days..sometimes longer..up to 90 days. That’s why I reached out to eBay. Below is the email response from eBay: Hello Christopher, Thank you for contacting eBay Customer Service regarding holds on funds. My name is Abhishek. I understand you wish to know the reason why it is still 3 days. I am more than happy to assist you. First of all, I am really happy to know that you have been doing really good in terms of your selling performance. I can see that you are becoming truly a great seller day by day. There are numerous reasons why funds may be held temporarily. We use holds to encourage best selling practices and to ensure both the buyer and the seller have a safe and smooth transaction. Funds are placed on hold to ensure transactions are completed successfully. In some situations, this means allowing extra time after the buyer has received the item – even if they have left feedback – to review their purchase. This also means funds are available to sellers if they need to accept a return or provide a refund to the buyer. eBay must adhere to certain legal and compliance obligations, outlined in our Payments Terms of Use, which require us to place funds on hold in certain circumstances. We must also ensure eBay remains a safe marketplace for both buyers and sellers. This means we may place a hold on funds for some transactions. These 3 days time is actually a normal time line for every sellers to get their funds, there are cases where funds can be hold for longer than that. But, you have been on eBay now for 100 days there are very less chances to getting l",

I've had problems with impulse buying before however it was always real life shopping in a mall or a store and was about much smaller amounts. I think it's important to mention that I suffer with bpd and currently I'm very lonely and looking for ways to escape the reality full with boredom and loneliness which I think was the main factor to this breakout. Even though I realized the amounts I'm spending and that I'm having a serious problem and I'm trying to control it, I'm still opening the app a few times a day and scrolling looking for anything good. Whenever I see anything I want it takes me less than a minute to go to checkout. What do I do? How do I stop this? I'm not in a dangerous financial situation but at this point I feel stupid and annoyed at myself for this. Is anyone else having the same problem? How do I distract myself?",

I bought it on eBay after selling a huge Yankees card from Triple Threads Topps decided they couldn't make the card. 3 of the 10 guys on it have now passed away. It's not unreasonable, but they substituted the first card here without even an email or a question, despite multiple emails saying I did not want a substitution. A Shohei auto /199 die cut. It's dope, but it's not even close to what I wanted, despite it being worth almost the same as what I paid for the redemption originally. I called Topps and spoke with a dude named Jesse. He was floored at the names on my original redemption. He sent a message to the redemption team requesting some Cardinals stuff to make up for failing to produce the card I desired so much, but made no guarantees. Fast forward a week and a half, and I had another shipment coming from Topps. They sent me a Gilded Collection Pujols auto /10 and a sweet Goldy relic /10 from Diamond Icons, I think it's a piece of his elbow guard. Jesse, you're the man. This isn't what I originally wanted but the extra swag you convinced the redemption team to send me softens the blow quite a bit. At least I have a couple sweet PC cards to put in my display case and may end up selling the Shohei to make my money back. Topps sure as hell ain't perfect, but they made this right, and I appreciate it. Hope y'all had a great Easter and enjoy seeing these beastly cards!",

The most common piece of feedback I’ve seen given here by experienced bookkeepers is that you don’t have enough information from the client. It’s not enough to know the number of accounts and number of transactions. You need to know the COMPOSITION of those transactions. If a client has 300 transactions, are those 10 invoices via direct ACH deposit and 290 simple expenses via credit card that can be sorted via auto add rules? Or is it a cacophony of 147 invoices in a POS system where fees need to be entered manually or via a clearing account, 16 returns, 4 credit card credits, 34 checks that need to be verified against the bank statement, 8 transfers to PayPal, 10 owner’s draws, 2 random AR in Quickbooks because the POS wasn’t compatible with a few client payments, 6 loan payments split between principal and interest, 8 payroll transactions (4 for wages, 4 for taxes), 2 charges for little Betty’s soccer camp that should’ve been on the client’s personal card instead, 15 purchases of fixed assets (via accrual basis, needing original cost and depreciation sub accounts created for each one, each time a new asset is added to the books), and 47 simple expenses (i.e. monthly software subscription costs, utilities, etc..)? To give the right pricing, you need to ask the right questions. Does the client want to track individual invoices per customer name or are they okay with recording more general bulk sales deposits? Do they want to track by location, by project, by product line (class and location tracking). Do they want receipt tracking? How is your client currently keeping their books? Will you have to transition them into new software or are they already set up? Do they accept USD only or do they accept 14 foreign currencies? Do they sell on just Etsy? Or Ets",

          "text": "Opinions on where to set up shop online? I have a shop, website (currently under construction to speed up processes, ease of checkout and better inventory system) as well as an eBay store where I mainly sell basketball cards; but have a little of everything. I decided to open the eBay store 3 years ago to try and widen my audience to help get rid of some basic cards that were taking up too much room, but still selling all my graded cards or even raw cards worth money that had been pulled. So basically a decent balanced selection....I’ve been a Top Seller on eBay since month 3 of my store being opened. I had to upgrade my store within the first year, because I was expanding so quickly with the amount of cards, memorabilia, and sports card products. At this point, I’m still a Top Seller and everything was going smoothly as I have around 1K cards or listings active right now. February marked my first month of not being a Top Seller, but Above Average due to eBay hitting my metrics with stuff like “tracking not uploaded or updated”, “Not shipped on time”, and a refund to a customer who lives outside the US and used a reshipper to get his card via PWE and complained within the first week and then on week two opened an “item not received request”. I’ve contacted eBay about all kinds of issues and it’s just circle talk, they won’t allow you to speak with a supervisor. They just put you off on someone else in the same department and won’t answer any questions or issues as an actual human. They just circle back around again.....so I’m ready to close up shop and set up on a different platform where I can still bulk upload, and hopefully bulk edit. So, ridiculously long story short....if you were going to or have started from scratch on a platform with 1K cards or so, what platform would that be? I’m a member of a lot of platforms, some that are semi-private and the rest wide open to the public. All fine with me. But I hate eBay so much right now and have since around October-",

I think I spent like 1.5k on completing it (that’s including the LR++ cards being the most expensive). So what I’m asking here is if I just buy the 12 box case of the new Steel Requiem, which is around 1.5k, what are the chances that I complete the whole set with just that 1 purchase?

One of the most common, if not the most common questions being asked by any new collector is “How much is this card worth”. Knowing the price of any card is useful when buying, selling or trading. This post will make an attempt to provide a simple, step-by-step guide to finding the realistic value of your Pokémon cards. The aim is to help collectors prevent underselling cards or overpaying when buying the cards.

My personal preference is visiting a website like [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Trading_Card_Game) to search for the card details. Alternatively, one can also use any search engine by typing the name of the Pokemon and the set number. This will usually give an image match with which the other details can be found out.

I prefer the cleaner look of the base cards, where you can see the field, fans, stadiums, etc VS parallels editions that block or blur out with gimmicky graphics. I had all my cards from the 80/90s stolen but recently started to get interested in collecting a handful of my favorite players. I'm not a fan of the company Fanatics and them buying Topps turned me off from buying packs. Instead of directly giving Fanatics money I'm buying individual cards on ebay.
