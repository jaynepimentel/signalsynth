Here’s the kicker though……I’m not really a sports fan. \n\nI don’t have the room to display it, so it just sits in storage. Pretty much everything is autographed most are certified by JSA. I have signed basketball shoes, signed football and baseball jerseys, Pennants, lots of photos and plaque mounts. Baseballs, a huge poster of the entire kings playoff team.l, all sorts of crazy shit. \n\nI really don’t want to split the collection up but it’s extremely broad. Everything from baseball, football and basketball to golf, nascar and motorcycle racing. How would one go about finding a buyer? Is there a sports specific auction house? I don’t really want to do eBay or marketplace.",

Basically the house always wins but once in a while may get something back, but you’re really paying for the entertainment. \n\nSo we played and we weren’t going to pay for a whole team but toward the end they grouped several teams together (not sure what that’s called) and then you could buy a 1 of 10 positions - basically sharing with 9 other guys. I have no idea how they divide the cards if something in your group gets something. \n\nBut I saw the charge ($20) hit my Apple Pay and then saw after the cards broke that I had something waiting to be mailed (or to get a mailing slip…something) \n\nThen this showed up in the mail. \n\nI couldn’t find something exactly similar (21/25) but the 3/3 cards were asking for a lot. So hoping to break even. But it was fun but I still don’t know exactly how it worked because we didn’t buy a whole team. ",

Huge audience, auctions or Buy It Now. Great for liquidity, but you really need to know what you’re doing with authentication.\n\nGoldin\nMore high-end, auction-focused. Best for rare or valuable signed pieces. Not ideal for low-value items, but strong buyer confidence.\n\nFanatics Collect\nGrowing fast. Focused on authenticated items with auctions and vaulting. Feels more “modern” and collector-oriented.\n\nPristine Marketplace / Pristine Auctions\nVery popular for signed memorabilia. Lots of daily auctions, especially for hats, jerseys, and photos.\n\nBeckett Marketplace\nGood if you’re already dealing with graded cards or Beckett-authenticated items.\n\nI know these Specialty Memorabilia Shops (Mostly Buying, Sometimes Consignment)\n\nSportsMemorabilia.com\n\nPro Am Sports (Canada)\n\nFrameworth (Canada)\n\nImperial Sports (Canada)\n\nMintink (cards & autos)\n\nEast Coast Sports Collectibles\n\nThese are great for buying with confidence, though prices can be higher than peer-to-peer marketplaces.\n\nWhich platforms do YOU trust the most for signed caps or memorabilia? Where have you gotten your best deals? Any platforms you avoid — and why?\n\nAre there any underrated sites or communities I’m missing?\nAlways good to learn from other collectors.",

    "text": "On January 24, 2026, in Downers Grove, Illinois, 19-year-old Nedas Revuckas reportedly bought a 1994 Ford Ranger pickup truck from Gabriel Morales, Eliza’s husband, after he listed it for sale on Facebook Marketplace. \n\nTwo days later, on January 26, 2026, Revuckas came back to return license plates and get a bill of sale. It was at that time, that he allegedly attacked Eliza — who was 5 months pregnant with her second child — by stabbing her 70 times, primarily in the head and neck, ultimately killing her and her unborn child.\n\nRevuckas also stabbed the family dog, which survived, and set the apartment on fire. \n\nHe was caught shortly after the murder through a combination of digital evidence, physical surveillance, and direct identification of his vehicle. \n\nInvestigators quickly learned Revuckas lived in Westmont and located the 1994 Ford Ranger pickup truck parked in the driveway. \n\nBuilding security cameras showed him arriving to the Morales’ apartment at approximately 5:30 p.m. to return the plates. Although he claimed to have left through the main entrance, the footage did not show him exiting the building.\n\nA search warrant executed at his home on Spruce Lane uncovered bloody boots and clothing. Additional evidence, including a blood-stained jacket, bloody gloves, and Eliza’s work IDs and lanyard, were found in a trash can at a nearby Ace Hardware where Revuckas had attempted to clean himself.\n\nFollowing his arrest, he reportedly confessed to the killing, stating he was frustrated with the condition of the truck he had purchased and decided to take it out on Eliza.\n\nRevuckas is charged with multiple felonies, including first-degree murder, intentional homicide of an unborn child, armed robbery (for taking Eliza’s work ID and her husband’s debit card), aggravated arson, and aggravated cruelty to animals.\n\nFollowing a court appearance on January 29, 2026, a judge ordered him to be held in jail, citing him as a danger to the community. That same day, he was hospitalized in critical condition after injuring himself while in custody at the DuPage County Jail.\n\nAs of February 1, 2026, Revuckas was released from the hospital and returned to the DuPage County Correctional Facility.\n\nProsecutors are seeking to have the case deemed exceptionally brutal and heinous, which could result in a natural life sentence or up to 100 years in prison.",

It took 4 days to get down to the last few teams. They had to serial one due to the price then it was down to just the Nationals. \n\nThe Nats were discounted several times over 6 hours and no bites. I offered 50 dollars for the laughs but they took it. 😂 The chat thanked me for “taking one for the team.” The break finally begins.\n\nThe first box he pulls a Randy Johnson First Inscriptions card and the chat is excited and the host seems to be mildly amused and moves on to box 2. The third card he pulls causes his face to look like he’s going to puke. Here’s the pulls from the 20 cards total 😆.\n\nWhich leads me to the question…..there’s not a ton of data that I can find.

It's really sad seeing how many fakes are popping up and how ebay does literally nothing about it.  \nHas anyone had experience with getting ebay to do anything?  \n(btw I never thought for a second this was a real card but someone did)\n\nI also provided ebay with a side by side picture showing the fake vs real. I pointed out every detail that you can easily identify. They need to have a department that looks into claims better. I also see a ton of sellers selling fake silver and gold even us currency. They wont delete or take any of those serious. Ebay is using AI to determine if these are fake and they dont even have an option to get a human to look into it. ",

    "text": "Hi all — I have a Kiangnan “Old Kiangnan” dollar (LM-210A), currently in an older-generation NGC holder graded AU55. I mainly sell/consign via Heritage HK / SBP HK.\n\nI’m debating whether it’s worth doing a PCGS crossover vs keeping it in NGC. Ideally I’d only want to cross if it can stay AU55, but I’m also considering whether an AU53 outcome could still make sense.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* For Chinese silver (late Qing / provincial), how often do you see NGC AU55 cross to PCGS AU55?\n* Is crossover generally more conservative than cracking and submitting raw?\n* Any advice on minimum grade setting (AU55 vs AU53 vs ANY)?\n* If the coin can only cross at PCGS AU53, is that still a reasonable move in terms of market acceptance/value?\n* Does pedigree/provenance help at all with PCGS decisions, or is it purely surface/grade?\n\nThanks!",

    "text": "I see a number of posts lately that all have some form of the following statement:\n\n“Why should I keep buying from my LCS when their prices are higher than Walmart or Target?”\n\nLet’s break it down.\n\nFrom basically the beginning of card shops in the 70’s, those card shop owners all got business accounts with the various card companies. At first, just Topps/Bowman/OPeeChee. Then later Upper Deck/Leaf/Panini.\n\nLike almost all “retail agreements”, they entered into a contract where they got “X amount of product” at “X amount of money” per case. Per their agreement, they would sell at an agreed upon MSRP. Those were the rules. As long as you followed them; you kept your allocation and good standing.\n\nThat was pretty much how it went until 2020. That’s when the COVID boom happened; and all the sudden the sleepy little hobby that hasn’t been mainstream popular since the late 90’s, became extremely relevant again.\n\nOnce there’s money involved; the big players will figure out a way to exploit the situation.\n\nEnter Fanatics.\n\nIn 2021, they secured the rights and licenses to be the exclusive producer of cards for MLB, NFL, NBA and a few smaller sports. Essentially ending Panini’s reign.\n\nThe problem was, they had the licenses, but they didn’t have any way to actually produce cards.\n\nEnter Topps acquisition. In January of 2022, Fanatics purchased Topps Inc for around $500 million. This now gave them the infrastructure, brand name, and immediate rights to MLB, MLS, UEFA, Bundesliga, F1 & more. They also bought some smaller brands (like Mitchell & Ness), to help co-brand apparel and trading cards.\n\nWe’re now in 2026, and Panini is on its last breath. Their NFL license expires in April, which will then give Fanatics 100% control of all major sports.\n\n. . . . . . . .\n\nOk cool? So what does that have to do with my LCS and their high prices?!?\n\nGlad you asked.\n\n\\[and for the record, this is direct knowledge from two local card shop owners who I know very well, and have let me peek behind the curtain. This is legitimate information from real people in the space. \\*\\*\\*Not\\*\\*\\* speculation\\]\n\nSlowly, over the past three years, Fanatics has been shifting the landscape. When they first bought Topps, allocations and accounts were same old, same old. But then something curious happened.\n\nBecause of the insane demand, and (at the time) limited supply, aftermarket prices starting creeping up. Fanatics/Topps would sell a box to your LCS for $100. That same box would sell for $175-$200 within a week. For the bigger, ultra popular releases, you’d see up to a 300% price in the aftermarket.\n\nAs an example (because I’m a baseball guy) 2022 Topps Chrome Cosmic, sold for $185 a hobby box. 2025 Topps Chrome Cosmic, on the aftermarket, now sells for around $700 a box. That’s almost a 400% increase in price in less than five years.\n\nFanatics (and this is where I give them a bit of a pass) saw that their products that they were selling to your LCS, were being sold and scalped for \\*\\*\\*significantly\\*\\*\\* more in the open market. They decided that \\*\\*\\*they\\*\\*\\* should be the ones getting those prices. Not the LCS. Not the scalpers.\n\nThat’s when they initiated their long term plan.\n\n1. Drastically reduce allocation at release date. Your LCS used to be able to buy case after case after case of whatever they sold, at a reasonable price. Fanatics realized that they were being cut out of the profits of the final sale price on the aftermarket, so they basically said “instead of dozens of cases at the same price, we’re now going to give you one or two cases. Then, once we see what market conditions look like, we’ll allow you to buy more, but this time it will be dynamic pricing.\n\nExample: My LCS got exactly one case of ‘25 Cosmic Chrome. He showed me the invoice. It cost him $385 a box. For one case. He sold them for $425. After he sold out of that, he was offered two more cases, at $440 a box. He bought those, and sold them for $500 a box. He then got a third chance from Fanatics directly; at $610 a box. He sells them for $700 each, and they’ve been sitting there for a while and I don’t know if he can move them at that price.\n\nHe’s one of the lucky LCS that has a decent sized account. So he gets slightly better treatment than most. Your average LCS isn’t so lucky. So they do the only thing they can.\n\nBuy at aftermarket prices, just like you or me can.\n\nThe difference is, they have a brick and mortar store to pay for. Rent. Insurance. Employees. Utilities. Etc. So they have no choice but to bake that into their pricing. If they pay $500 for a box, they can’t sell it for $500. They have to sell it for $550 or more. If they didn’t, they couldn’t keep their lights on.\n\nThis is where it gets wicked.\n\nFanatics saw the writing on the wall, and realized that in essence, the LCS is just a middleman taking food out of their mouths. So what do you do with a middleman? You systematically eliminate them.\n\nAnd that is \\*\\*\\*exactly\\*\\*\\* what Fanatics is currently in the process of doing.\n\nThey’ve now moved to step two. Keep cutting allocations, and keep raising prices so the LCS has no real reason to stay open. If you can hop on Fanatics.com as a consumer and pay less than what it costs at your LCS, that’s exactly what most consumers will do. Fanatics is well aware of this.\n\nSo they aren’t directly cutting ties with the LCS. They’re just making it impossible to make the numbers work. In essence, they aren’t pointing a gun at the LCS and pulling the trigger. Instead they’re basically starving them. And after long enough without food, they \\*\\*\\*will\\*\\*\\* die.\n\nWhich brings us to step three.\n\nThe FanaticsVerse.\n\nThey now, own not only the licenses, and the production…. But they also now own distribution. And they are forcing everyone to buy either direct from Fanatics, or worse, through their carefully curated breakers on their FanaticsLive platform. Breakers are their biggest profit maker. Because they can charge them insane prices, knowing that the breakers will split it 30 ways and make paying for one team, or one player, the “new normal”.\n\nAnd it’s already working. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen “it’s not that bad spending $50 to get my favorite team that I PC. Thats way better than paying $1,000 for a box.”\n\nWhat average Joe doesn’t realize is that $50 a team multiplied by 32 teams is $1,600. For a $1,000 box (that the Fanatics breaker paid ≈$700 for). And that’s assuming it’s a breaker who isn’t selling for even more of a markup (spoiler alert: there are some \\*\\*\\*really\\*\\*\\* bad ones out there).\n\nFanatics then gets to take their cut from all sales on FanaticsLive. So they’re basically double dipping. They sell direct to their preferred breakers at a big markup, \\*\\*\\*then\\*\\*\\* take a slice of every sale on their platform.\n\nTheir plan is to have essentially removed all LCS from the picture by 2030. And based on current projections, they may be ahead of schedule.\n\nAnd what does that mean for you the consumer? It means the same thing it always does when one company controls almost 100% of any market.\n\nPrices rise. Selection decreases. And if you choose to stay in the Hobby, you’re going to be doing so at the mercy of Fanatics and their billionaire playboy owner Michael Rubin.\n\nIt’s going to be an interesting few years ahead to say the least.\n\nEDIT: To those saying “just stop buying and it fixes everything”… unfortunately that’s a simplified view that glosses over the other thing Fanatics has done that I didn’t even touch on in this manifesto: turning cards from a hobby, into hardcore gambling. You may laugh at me, but I’m telling you right now modern collecting is no different than the casino. In fact; it may be worse. At least casinos are regulated. And I’m also telling you there are tens of thousands of “collectors” out there, with addictive personalities that have been exploited… and those people have lost everything. Money. Spouses. Cars. Homes. It’s \\*very\\* real and very sad.",

    "text": "# Randa Abdel-Fattah: The Untouchable Extremist\n\nPreaching intimidation, vilification and harassment under the mantle of scholarship has made her a hero of the cultural Left.\n\n[**HENRY ERGAS**](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/author/henry-ergas)\n\nu/HenryErgas\n\n10 min read\n\nFebruary 3, 2026 - 7:35AM\n\nRanda Abdel-Fattah, and one of her many interactions on social media. Artwork: Frank Ling.\n\n\n\nOn October 7, 2023, as the gates of hell opened for some, the gates of fame opened for others. And for no one more so than Randa Abdel-Fattah. An obscure academic at Macquarie University, whose intellectual output had not even caused a ripple in radical sociology’s crowded waters, she was known, if at all, for her children’s books. Turning catastrophe into opportunity, she vaulted into public visibility by adopting a style of political performance in which provocation displaced argument and outrage replaced judgment.\n\nThe effect was immediate. What began as a series of shock interventions rapidly coalesced into a recognisable persona, one rewarded by constant amplification. Invitations followed, platforms multiplied, and outrage became not merely a tactic but a credential. In a time that values performative antagonism over measured reflection, she proved an ideal fit: reliably newsworthy, quotable, and always available.\n\nInstant [notoriety thus hardened into an expanding public presence](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/i-wont-back-down-on-moment-of-freedom-says-randa-abdelfattah/news-story/680af1964d60bd404bcc92cf479fe99a) – one that made her, for the first time, a star and a fixture on the progressive elite’s indignation-driven cultural scene. Nowhere was that clearer than in the [uproar surrounding the Adelaide Writers Festival](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/how-adelaide-writers-week-collapsed-under-the-weight-of-its-own-hypocrisy/news-story/aa6ba2e47c2958e9fc24811b373d621d), when many seemingly decent people accepted her assertion that she was the carefully selected victim of a smear campaign – a campaign [Louise Adler](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/inquirer/louise-adler-knows-fullwell-the-randa-abdelfattah-controversy-is-about-her-hate-for-israel-and-its-people-not-her-palestinianness/news-story/98a99c73d40d0d9471a79492716220c4) characterised last week as part of an incipient wave of McCarthyism.\n\nThe style she adopted made those protestations of innocence far easier to sustain. Because so much of her public presence takes the form of short, disjointed social-media interventions, its overall content is inherently difficult to reconstruct, allowing her to brush aside the objections her vitriolic statements regularly provoke. Yet when reassembled, those fragments cohere into a moral and political universe that leaves little room for persuasion, inquiry, or disagreement – and whose unqualified exaltation of violence, adamant rejection of intellectual and political pluralism, and strident advocacy of harassment and intimidation sharply contradict her self-presentation as an academic rationally and peacefully advocating for Palestinian rights.\n\nSocial media interactions involving Randa Abdel-Fattah are regularly vitriol-infused. Picture: Instagram\n\nAt the heart of that style, which has now become her trademark, lies its incessant tempo. The sheer pace and intensity of Abdel-Fattah’s outpourings continuously stoke her supporters’ rage while leaving opponents flat-footed and disoriented. The need to remain at the front of the pack leads her to constantly escalate the vehemence of her rhetorical aggression, generating torrents of increasingly incendiary claims that gain traction not by withstanding scrutiny, but by permanently outrunning it.\n\n# ‘Demons … committing a Holocaust’\n\nRemarkably for an academic – more remarkably still for one lavishly [funded by taxpayers](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/calls-to-strip-antiisrael-academic-randa-abdelfattah-of-870000-research-grant/news-story/701ca658fd7b239f4e0d03e04a45fd6c) – her aim is not to inform, much less to debate. “Dealing with a Zio,” declares a social-media post she retweeted, is pointless, “as they will bring up questions instead of admitting you are right”.\n\nWhat Israel’s defenders deserve, she insists, is not the opportunity to question and rebut their critics; it is only to “never know a second’s peace in (their) sadistic, miserable lives”. Even respected scholars whose views differ from hers and those of her supporters “are not our peers, not our acquaintances”. Rather than dialogue, their proper fate is erasure, to be delivered in what she chillingly calls “the time of reckoning”.\n\nNor is there any doubt, in her mind, as to who those opponents really are. The “demons” who are “committing a Holocaust”, as she tweeted in an unguarded ­moment, are “the people of the Holocaust”: that is, the Jews.\n\nThere are, to be sure, a few Jews she deems acceptable – just as Stalin, while butchering Soviet Jewry’s finest thinkers for being “Zionists” and “cosmopolitans”, flaunted Ilya Ehrenburg and Lazar Kaganovich as proof that his regime was not antisemitic. But if “the majority of Jewish people allow themselves to be used as human ideological shields for Zionism, that is not a problem for Palestinians to solve” – and the price “the majority of Jewish people” will pay is their own fault alone.\n\nRanda Abdel-Fattah is prolific on social media site X, whether tweeting, commenting or re-tweeting. Picture: X\n\nThe fact that the line between virulent opposition to Zionism and inciting hatred of Jews is perilously thin therefore gives her no pause. “It’s not my job to manage my words because Zionists have deliberately linked Jewish identity with a violent racist political ideology”.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that her accusations unerringly echo the oldest antisemitic tropes. The principle underpinning their selection is simple. Anything Hamas, its sympathisers or fellow travellers assert, however outlandish, is treated as self-evidently true; anything Israel says is dismissed as self-evidently false, without the slightest need for ­further inquiry.\n\nThe allegations she assembles on the basis of that premise – a premise that has nothing to do with academic ethics and everything to do with propaganda – are saturated by a virtually pornographic fixation on the carnal destruction of bodies. “The Zionists”, she repeatedly tells her followers, “harvest organs” from Palestinians, “burn civilians alive as they laugh on camera”, “annihilate children in viral TikTok videos”, “torch homes for fun”, free prisoners only to “then execute them”, and “have people raped violently by animals”.\n\n# ‘Genocidal slaughterhouse’\n\nIt is not Hamas and Hezbollah – who fight for “the best of humanity” – but the Israelis, “the worst of humanity”, who are trapped in a “psychopathic death cult ritual”. As for Israel itself, a “genocidal slaughterhouse” that is “dripping in Arab blood”, it stands condemned as a “cursed stain on humanity”.\n\nOne can readily see how, ­within this vision, the paraglider of October 7 is effortlessly transformed from a symbol of wanton rape and murder into a motif of “insurgent hope” and “prison escape”. It is obvious too that any ­future of coexistence is literally unthinkable, given that “we cannot co-exist with our genocidal oppressors”. The only solution is “the end of the US-Israeli imperial scourge”, which in turn requires “the abolishment of the death cult of Zionism and the end of US empire”. Regardless of its human costs, the eradication of Israel and the final defeat of the US will “snowball collective liberation, because the tentacles of Western imperialism oppress and dehumanise us all”.\n\nPreaching intimidation, vilification and harassment under the mantle of scholarship has made her a hero of cultural Left\n\nYet Zionism, fused with American power, is not merely a deadly adversary. It is a system so pervasive and corrupting that it invariably seeks to crush any opposition, including in Australia. And as “a brown woman with a platform” she is a natural target of the “malicious pro-Israel propaganda machine”, which has deployed “the same eliminatory logic that powers the bombs in Gaza” to secure her “bureaucratic and cultural assassination”.\n\nBut if the “Zionist lobby” gains any traction on our shores, it is only because this country – dismissed by her as “so-called Australia” – is “a racialised colony where Palestinians are evicted from the category of human”. Permeated by a “white supremacist logic” that slots Palestinians into the “bestial, savage, predatory” tropes used against “brown and black communities in service of Empire”, the self-proclaimed “progressives” who govern Australia amount to little more than a despicable “Diet Coke (version) of the far right”.\n\nAnother Abdel-Fattah social media post about Jewish people and Zionism. Pictures: Supplied\n\nTheir refusal to entirely sever our ties with Israel follows directly from that lineage: both states, she insists, are “built on a shared history of frontier violence” and remain committed to “the ongoing maintenance of white supremacy in the Global South”.\n\nFor the same reason, the progressives’ obsession with “dialogue” and “civility” is no more than a “velvet glove on the iron fist of colonialism”. The fantasies they peddle of the “marketplace of ideas” are also just a trap, a shield of “cotton wool” wrapped around racism to prevent the “reckoning”. And as for “all this hysteria about the social cohesion of Australians”, including the wave of concern that has followed the murderous antisemitic attack at Bondi, it is mere froth that reflects “the domestic anxieties of the ­coloniser”.\n\nIn effect, with “whiteness” finally under serious threat, the “weaponisation of grief, tears, outrage, shock, and horror by the coloniser” is another thinly veiled cover for treating “the challenge to the settler-colonial peace as a national security threat”, stepping up repression. As the slide towards open authoritarianism progresses, “words are being criminalised, jobs are being threatened, and our very history is being erased to satisfy the demands of the Zionist lobby”.\n\nTo believe that there can or should be, in this “racialised battlefield”, any scope for compromise is entirely delusional. At this “pivotal moment in the collapse of Western moral authority,” when the “kingdom of the dark” – Western imperialism and its inherently “racialised” colonial outposts – is finally being unmasked by the “unrelenting light of Palestinian resistance”, “you ­either stand with the oppressed and their right to resist, or you stand with the machinery of death and the institutions that facilitate it. There is no middle ground”.\n\nThat Manichean choice applies every bit as clearly here as in the Middle East. “To stand with Palestine in Australia,” she writes, “is to confront the foundational lie of the Australian state: that this is a land of the ‘fair go’ rather than a site of ongoing racialised dispossession.” Only through that strategy of subversion and resistance will it be possible to begin “the dismantling of the white supremacist structures that govern every aspect of life in this colony, from the classroom to the courtroom”.\n\nShortly after Hamas terrorists parachuted into Israel to massacre civilians at a music festival on October 7, 2023, she said \"there is a feeling of pride'' at what has happened\".\n\nThe alternative is to allow the “structural Islamophobia” which is an entrenched feature of Australia to persist: a “structural Islamophobia” which “the white supremacist state (requires) to justify its policing of racialised bodies at home”.\n\nTaken together, these elements cohere into a single, internally consistent cast of mind that is driven by a closed and unforgiving logic. The world is divided between “the oppressed and their right to resist” and “the machinery of death”, with “no middle ground”. Zionism, fused with Western power, is cast as a “white supremacist” system that saturates states and institutions; Australia itself becomes a “racialised colony” whose “white supremacist logic” polices, suppresses and brutalises “racialised bodies” at home.\n\nBecause power is thus imagined as total and racialised – embedded in institutions and even in grief itself – persuasion is ruled out in advance. Disagreement becomes complicity; civility and dialogue are recoded as ploys designed to defer the “reckoning”. Political and intellectual pluralism are nothing but shams.\n\nJust as eradication is reframed as “collective liberation”, coercing opponents into silence therefore appears as mere justice, while dismantling Australia’s “Whiteness” is presented not as extremism but as a moral necessity – one that promises a redemptive future for Palestinians and Indigenous Australians alike.\n\nIt is not difficult to discern, in this phantasmagoria, the sediment of older ideological monstrosities. There is, to begin with, the legacy of Marxism in its crudest forms, with its insistence on relentless, remorseless struggle as the engine of history and its utopian promise of total human emancipation. Even clearer is the imprint of Lenin, who dismissed “bourgeois ethics” as “moralising vomit” while justifying terror in the name of “cleansing” the world of the “cursed stain” of reactionaries. Starkly Leninist too is the Manicheanism, with Lenin proclaiming that “the only choice is either the bourgeois or the socialist ideology: there neither is, nor can there be, a middle course” – so that all those who are not on the “right side of history”, including social democrats, liberals and other moderates, have no right to exist, much less to speak.\n\nAbel-Fattah updated her Facebook profile with the image of a parachutist in the colours of the Palestinian flag, a day after Hamas terrorists parachuted into Israel to murder and kidnap hundreds of civilians.\n\nCrucially transposed by Frantz Fanon into a struggle between “White faces” and Black, that Manicheanism was later recast into a “racialised” battle in which the enslaved peoples of the “Third World” would “bring about not only their own liberation, but also the world-historic destruction of the power-apparatus oppressing all humanity”, thereby “permanently alter(ing) the human condition”.\n\nAnd implicit in those 1950s adaptations of Leninism were the seeds of what later hardened into Critical Race Theory. Most importantly, Albert Memmi – a central figure of that moment who would later repudiate the movement over its genocidal anti-Zionism – famously argued that the coloniser possesses “Whiteness” as a birthright privilege, quite independently of personal conduct or merit.\n\nOnce that premise is accepted, moral responsibility dissolves into racial essence. Arbitrarily “killing a European settler” accordingly ceases to be a crime and becomes – in the notorious words of Jean-Paul Sartre’s 1961 preface to Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth – a “two birds with one stone” act that destroys both oppressor and oppressed, “creating a free man”: a grotesque moral alchemy that elevates executioners into the saviours of their victims.\n\nIt is all of this that underpins Abdel-Fattah’s cast of mind, and most notably her cult of violence, though there is no reason to believe she has any close familiarity with the intellectual history from which it descends. Merged in her academic work with a large – and potentially lethal – dose of poorly digested Foucault and Bourdieu, it yields an analytical outlook that despises the very idea of intellectual objectivity, bears no meaningful relationship to even the most elementary requirements of rigorous empirical validation, and serves a single instrumental purpose: to help cloak the advocacy of intimidation, vilification and harassment in the mantle of scholarship.\n\nAcademic freedom is thereby invoked not to protect inquiry, but to license silencing and coercion, notably by obliterating the “cultural safety” of the Zionists and liberals she abhors. The privileges of the academy are claimed in full, while its ethical obligations – including respect for the diversity of opinions and the value of intelligent discussion – are repudiated wholesale. Shielded by notoriety from what would otherwise be the professional consequences of thus breaching the norms that underpin academic freedom, Abdel-Fattah is able, at the taxpayer’s expense, to indulge in the Intifada of the faculty lounge, where the vicarious thrills of revolutionary violence are prosecuted from the safety of Macquarie University before breaking for lunch.\n\nMeanwhile, her followers – who are even more confused than she is – can luxuriate in fantasies of storming the Winter Palace, all the while wailing about their supposed victimhood at the hands of a repressive order at whose teat they suck.\n\nBut none of those absurdities can hide far more sinister undertones and realities. Voltaire put it best, in his entry on fanaticism in the Encyclopaedia: it is rogues, masquerading as thinkers, who guide fanatics and put murderous daggers in their hands.\n\nAnd it is no accident that all of the worldviews she has inherited have ended in calamitous disasters which – far from bringing human liberation – have wrought only death and destruction.\n\nYes, Randa Abdel-Fattah may, in this fatuous era of ours, be the fatuous hero of a fatuous herd. But read as a whole, her words lead to only one end – an end which is forever painted in blood and sorrow on the sand, the stone, and the shattered lives of Bondi Beach.",

    "text": "# A legendary racing car pulled from Lake Maggiore in 2009 revealed mysteries about pre-war automotive history.\n\nA 1925 Bugatti Type 22 Brescia Roadster emerged from Lake Maggiore in 2009, dragged from depths where it had rested for over 70 years in circumstances that remain disputed to this day. The recovery, witnessed by historians, collectors, and local authorities, revealed a vehicle remarkably preserved by freshwater submersion, its delicate mechanical components encrusted with silt and aquatic growth but structurally intact beneath decades of lake bed accumulation.\n\nThe Brescia represented one of Bugatti's earliest production sports cars, built during the 1920s when Ettore Bugatti's small Alsatian factory produced vehicles that dominated motorsport and captured the imagination of wealthy enthusiasts worldwide. Approximately 2,000 Type 22 and Type 23 Brescia models were produced between 1921 and 1926, with surviving examples today commanding values from £400,000 to over £1 million depending on specification, history, and condition.\n\nThis particular car's condition would charitably be described as requiring complete restoration, though that description fails to capture the magnitude of what 70 years underwater does to aluminum bodywork, steel chassis components, leather upholstery, and mechanical assemblies designed for precision engineering rather than aquatic environments.\n\n# How It Got There\n\nThe circumstances surrounding how a valuable Bugatti ended up at the bottom of Lake Maggiore depend on which version of events you believe, with theories ranging from smuggling operations gone wrong to insurance fraud to wartime activity that left the car abandoned and eventually submerged.\n\nOne account suggests the Bugatti belonged to a wealthy Swiss or Italian owner who attempted to hide the vehicle from authorities during World War II, when luxury cars faced confiscation by occupying forces or governments desperate for metal to support war production. Submerging the car in the lake, according to this theory, represented an attempt to preserve it until hostilities ended and retrieval became safe. The owner either died during the war or circumstances prevented recovery, leaving the Bugatti forgotten until divers discovered it decades later.\n\nAlternative theories propose smuggling operations across the Swiss-Italian border. Lake Maggiore straddles the frontier, with portions in both countries, making it historically attractive for smugglers moving goods to avoid customs duties or wartime restrictions. A Bugatti might have been loaded onto a boat for clandestine transport across the border, only for weather, accident, or authorities to force the vehicle's abandonment in deep water where evidence disappeared and retrieval proved impossible.\n\nThe most prosaic explanation involves a simple accident where the car rolled or was driven into the lake, whether through driver error, mechanical failure causing loss of control near the shore, or deliberate abandonment for reasons lost to history. Lakes have claimed countless vehicles over decades through mundane accidents that require no elaborate conspiracy theories to explain.\n\nWhatever the true circumstances, the Bugatti remained undiscovered until recreational divers exploring Lake Maggiore's depths encountered something that shouldn't exist in underwater environments: the unmistakable shape of a vintage automobile.\n\n# The Recovery Operation\n\nRecovering a 70-year-old car from significant depth requires specialized equipment and careful planning to prevent damage during the extraction process. The Bugatti rested in approximately 50 meters of water, deep enough to require technical diving expertise but shallow enough that recovery proved feasible with commercial diving equipment and crane apparatus.\n\nThe operation, documented through photographs and video that subsequently circulated widely across automotive media and enthusiast forums, showed the Bugatti emerging from the lake coated in thick layers of silt, aquatic vegetation, and the accumulated detritus of seven decades underwater. Water poured from every orifice as cranes lifted the car onto a recovery barge, the aluminum bodywork remarkably intact despite the extended submersion.\n\nFreshwater preservation proved crucial to the car's survival in recognizable form. Saltwater would have corroded aluminum and steel components beyond recognition within years, dissolving the vehicle into unidentifiable wreckage. Lake Maggiore's fresh water, while still destructive over decades, acted more gently, allowing the basic structure and many components to survive in forms that restoration specialists could potentially work with.\n\nThe chassis number, stamped into metal and still legible beneath silt accumulation, allowed researchers to identify the specific vehicle and trace its history through Bugatti factory records. This provenance documentation revealed the car's original specification, delivery details, and early ownership history, though it couldn't explain definitively how the vehicle ended up submerged.\n\n# What 70 Years Underwater Does\n\nThe physical condition of the recovered Bugatti fascinated automotive historians and restoration specialists, who rarely encounter vehicles subjected to such extreme environments for such extended periods. The damage patterns and preservation characteristics provided insights into how different materials and components respond to prolonged submersion.\n\nThe aluminum bodywork, while discolored and pitted, retained structural integrity and recognizable shape. Aluminum oxide formation, the white powdery substance that forms on aluminum exposed to water, covered exterior surfaces but hadn't penetrated deeply enough to compromise the basic panel structure. Restoration would require removing these corrosion products, assessing underlying metal condition, and likely fabricating replacement panels where damage exceeded repair capabilities.\n\nThe chassis, constructed from steel, suffered more severely. Rust formation compromised structural members, particularly at joints and stress points where water intrusion and corrosion combined to weaken material that once supported the vehicle's weight and driving forces. Whether enough original chassis remained to justify restoration rather than replica construction would require detailed structural analysis.\n\nMechanical components including the engine, gearbox, and final drive showed extensive corrosion both externally and internally. Water had penetrated these sealed assemblies, corroding precision machined surfaces that once operated with tolerances measured in thousandths of an inch. Pistons fused to cylinder walls. Bearings corroded into solid masses. Gear teeth pitted and corroded beyond salvageable condition.\n\nThe leather upholstery, wooden floorboards, and fabric components that once provided creature comfort had largely disintegrated, leaving only fragments and residue that indicated their former presence without retaining any structural integrity.\n\nRemarkably, certain components survived in surprisingly good condition. Glass lenses from headlights and instrumentation remained intact, protected by their non-reactive properties. Brass fittings and bronze bushings showed surface corrosion but retained dimensional accuracy beneath deposits. Even some wiring harnesses, protected by fabric insulation, preserved enough original material to allow analysis of the car's original electrical system.\n\n# The Restoration Question\n\nDiscovering a rare Bugatti creates immediate questions about restoration feasibility and philosophy. Should such a vehicle be restored to running condition, preserving as much original material as possible while replacing components too damaged to function? Should it remain in as-found condition, preserving the evidence of its extraordinary history even at the cost of never running again? Or should it be partially restored, maintaining its patina and history while stabilizing components to prevent further deterioration?\n\nThe automotive restoration community divides sharply on these questions, with strong opinions about the correct approach to historically significant vehicles in unusual conditions. Purists argue that the Lake Maggiore Bugatti's historical significance lies precisely in its condition as recovered, with restoration eliminating the evidence of its unique history and transforming it into merely another restored Type 22, indistinguishable from the hundreds of other examples that survived through more conventional means.\n\nPragmatists counter that Bugattis were built to be driven, that Ettore Bugatti intended these cars as functional racing and sporting machines rather than static museum pieces, and that restoration honoring his vision serves the car's purpose better than preserving it in corroded non-functional state.\n\nFinancial considerations complicate the philosophical debate. A fully restored Type 22 Brescia might command £600,000 to £800,000 depending on specification and restoration quality. The Lake Maggiore car, if restored to concours condition, could potentially exceed £1 million given its extraordinary provenance and story. However, restoration costs for a vehicle in this condition would likely approach or exceed £500,000, requiring complete mechanical rebuilding, extensive bodywork fabrication, and countless hours of specialist labor.\n\nPreserving the car as found, by contrast, requires minimal investment beyond stabilization to prevent continued deterioration. The vehicle retains its unique character and historical evidence while avoiding the enormous costs and philosophical compromises that restoration entails. However, it remains forever frozen in recovered condition, unable to demonstrate the performance and engineering excellence that made Bugattis legendary.\n\n# What Happened To The Car\n\nThe recovered Bugatti's current whereabouts and ownership remain somewhat unclear, with various reports suggesting it passed through multiple collections and may currently reside in a private European collection. Unlike many significant automotive discoveries, the Lake Maggiore Bugatti hasn't appeared at major auctions or been displayed at prominent automotive events, suggesting the owner prefers privacy over publicity.\n\nPhotographs from years following the recovery show the car in similar condition to its initial emergence, suggesting restoration hasn't been attempted or at least hasn't progressed to visible completion. This indicates the owner either embraced the preservation-in-place philosophy or encountered financial or practical obstacles preventing restoration from proceeding.\n\nThe lack of public information creates frustration among enthusiasts who would like to know the car's fate but also reflects reasonable desire for privacy from owners who don't wish to subject their possessions to constant public scrutiny and debate about appropriate conservation approaches.\n\n# Other Submerged Automotive Discoveries\n\nThe Lake Maggiore Bugatti represents the most famous but hardly the only significant automotive discovery recovered from underwater environments. Lakes, rivers, and coastal waters worldwide have yielded vehicles ranging from mundane to extraordinary, each with stories about how they ended up submerged and what happened after recovery.\n\nA 1932 Lancia Dilambda emerged from an Italian lake in similar circumstances to the Bugatti, also apparently hidden during wartime and never recovered. Various Alfa Romeo racing cars have been found in European waterways, their presence attributed to wartime chaos or smuggling operations.\n\nThe pattern suggests that using bodies of water as hiding places for valuable vehicles during World War II occurred more frequently than most people realize, though the success rate of subsequent recovery proved dismal as owners died, memories faded, and exact locations became impossible to pinpoint decades later.\n\nModern sonar and diving technology has made locating these submerged artifacts easier, but legal questions about ownership, salvage rights, and historical preservation complicate recovery even when vehicles are found. The Bugatti's case benefited from relatively clear legal situation, but other discoveries have generated disputes lasting years between finders, original owners' descendants, insurance companies with theoretical claims, and governments asserting cultural heritage interests.\n\n# The Broader Significance\n\nBeyond the specific vehicle and its particular circumstances, the Lake Maggiore Bugatti represents something larger about our relationship with automotive history and the extraordinary lengths people will go to preserve or recover objects they deem culturally significant.\n\nA 1920s sports car, however rare and historically important, remains fundamentally just a machine built to transport people more quickly and enjoyably than walking or using public conveyance. Yet the recovery operation required substantial planning, expense, and effort to extract this particular machine from its resting place and preserve it for study and potential restoration.\n\nThis level of commitment reflects values that transcend simple transportation function. The Bugatti represents engineering achievement, design excellence, and historical connection to an era when automobiles were transforming from expensive novelties into transformative technology reshaping human civilization. Preserving these artifacts preserves tangible links to that transformation and the people who created vehicles that still inspire enthusiasm nearly a century after their construction.\n\nThe questions about appropriate conservation approaches, restoration philosophy, and ultimate disposition apply to countless historically significant vehicles facing similar decisions about how best to preserve them for future generations. The Lake Maggiore Bugatti's unique circumstances created particularly stark choices between preservation and restoration, but the underlying tensions exist for any old car worth more as functioning vehicle than as static artifact.\n\nSomewhere, presumably in a European collection, the Lake Maggiore Bugatti sits as it has since recovery, covered in the patina of seven decades underwater, mechanically frozen but structurally intact, a monument to both human folly that resulted in its submersion and human determination that enabled its recovery. Whether it will ever run again, whether restoration will transform it into another beautiful Brescia or whether it remains forever as found, preserving the evidence of its extraordinary journey, only the owner knows.\n\nBut the story persists, reminding us that automotive history contains mysteries still being discovered, that lakes and rivers may harbor treasures waiting for the right diver to stumble upon them, and that a 1925 Bugatti can survive 70 years underwater and emerge to tell tales that speculation alone will never definitively resolve. That's magic worth appreciating regardless of restoration outcomes or ownership details. Some stories simply deserve telling, and the Bugatti that spent seven decades at the bottom of Lake Maggiore ranks among automotive history's best.",

    "text": "# Magnus Walker Is Auctioning His Porsche Collection\n\nThe man who turned a leather jacket and a dream into one of the world's most famous Porsche collections is finally letting go, and the automotive world is watching.\n\nMagnus Walker has spent the better part of three decades assembling one of the most recognizable Porsche collections on the planet. The British born entrepreneur, who arrived in Los Angeles in the 1980s with virtually nothing and built a fashion empire before discovering his true passion lay four wheels and a flat six engine away, has accumulated dozens of significant Porsches spanning generations of the iconic German sports car. Now, after years of speculation about whether his legendary garage would ever see the light of day at auction, Walker has confirmed he is selling.\n\nThe decision has generated excitement, anxiety, and genuine sadness among Porsche enthusiasts worldwide. Walker's collection isn't simply a wealthy man's accumulation of expensive cars. It represents decades of passionate, sometimes obsessive pursuit of specific machines at specific moments when they were overlooked, undervalued, and available to someone willing to look beyond conventional wisdom about which Porsches mattered.\n\nWalker built his reputation not by buying the obvious cars at obvious prices but by identifying machines that most collectors ignored. When the rest of the world chased 911 RS models and factory lightweight versions, Walker gravitated toward unique examples, unusual specifications, and cars with stories that transcended their mechanical specifications. His collection tells a narrative about what makes a Porsche special that price tags alone cannot explain.\n\n# How Walker Built His Empire\n\nMagnus Walker's journey from fashion entrepreneur to Porsche legend represents one of automotive culture's most compelling origin stories. Arriving in Los Angeles from Sheffield in the mid-1980s, Walker initially made his name in fashion, building a successful clothing brand that generated the wealth necessary to pursue automotive passions without financial constraint.\n\nHis first significant Porsche purchase occurred in the early 1990s, acquiring a 911 that captivated him in ways no fashion achievement could match. The mechanical engagement, the design heritage spanning decades, and the emotional connection that driving a great Porsche provides created an obsession that fashion could never satisfy.\n\nWhat distinguished Walker from other wealthy Porsche collectors was his willingness to research, travel, and negotiate for cars that others overlooked. While mainstream collectors focused on the most obvious desirable specifications and the cleanest provenance, Walker pursued cars with interesting histories, unusual factory options, and character that standard examples lacked.\n\nHis collection eventually grew to include over 50 significant Porsches spanning from the 1950s through the 1990s, including numerous 911 variants, 356 models, and special editions that collectively represented some of the most interesting examples of each generation ever assembled in private hands. Several cars in his collection have never been publicly shown, their existence known only to close associates until auction catalogues reveal them to the wider world.\n\nWalker's documentary appearances, social media presence, and willingness to share his passion with enthusiasts built a following that transcended traditional collector circles. Younger Porsche fans who discovered the brand through Walker's infectious enthusiasm and accessible storytelling represent a generation of collectors who might never have pursued vintage Porsches without his influence.\n\n# The Cars That Matter Most\n\nWhile the complete auction catalogue hasn't been fully disclosed as of early 2026, early indications suggest several cars that will generate extraordinary interest and potentially record-breaking results.\n\nWalker's 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS, one of the iconic homologation specials produced in just 1,580 examples to qualify the Carrera for racing, represents perhaps the collection's crown jewel. This particular example carries significant history and specification details that Walker spent years verifying and documenting. RS models have traded from £1 million to over £3 million in recent years depending on specification and provenance, with Walker's example likely commanding the upper reaches given its documented history and the provenance premium his ownership adds.\n\nA 1967 Porsche 911 S in factory Bahia Blue represents Walker's appreciation for early 911 aesthetics and the era when Porsche produced cars of such visual perfection that color choice alone determined whether a specific example achieved iconic status. Factory original Bahia Blue 911s in exceptional condition have traded above £500,000, with Walker's example potentially exceeding this given its specification and condition.\n\nSeveral 356 models in the collection, spanning from the early 1950s through the final 1965 examples, represent Walker's acknowledgment that Porsche's story began before the 911 and that earlier models offered driving experiences and design qualities that deserve equal reverence. The 356 market has strengthened considerably over the past decade as collectors recognize these cars as the foundation upon which Porsche's entire sporting identity was built.\n\nWalker's collection reportedly includes several 911 Turbo models from the 1970s and 1980s, the period when turbocharging transformed the 911 into a genuinely frightening performance machine. Early turbocharged 911s, particularly the legendary 930 Turbo with its notorious throttle lag and explosive power delivery, have appreciated dramatically as collectors recognize them as representing a unique and somewhat terrifying driving experience that modern turbocharged cars deliberately sanitize.\n\n# Why Sell Now?\n\nWalker has addressed the inevitable question directly in interviews and social media posts, though his answers have been characteristically thoughtful rather than providing a single definitive reason.\n\n\"I've had these cars for a long time,\" Walker explained in comments to Robb Report in December 2025. \"Some of them I've owned for 20 years or more. At a certain point you have to ask yourself whether you're actually enjoying the collection or whether you're just maintaining it. I wanted these cars to go to people who will drive them, enjoy them, and love them the way I did when I first acquired them.\"\n\nThe practical considerations also influence timing. Walker is approaching 60, a milestone that naturally prompts reflection about legacy, priorities, and how best to enjoy remaining decades. Holding a collection of this magnitude involves responsibilities including insurance, maintenance, storage, and security that consume time and resources regardless of how much enjoyment the cars provide.\n\nThe auction market's current strength provides favorable conditions for selling. Classic Porsche values have remained robust through 2025 despite broader economic uncertainty, with genuine enthusiast demand supporting prices at levels that might not persist if economic conditions deteriorate. Selling into strength rather than weakness represents shrewd financial thinking alongside the emotional considerations Walker has articulated.\n\nSome speculation suggests that Walker might retain certain cars while selling others, though official statements haven't confirmed which examples might remain in his personal collection. The possibility that Walker keeps one or two personal favorites while dispersing the remainder would represent a compromise between emotional attachment and the desire to see these cars experience new ownership and new adventures.\n\n# The Auction Dynamics\n\nSelling a collection of this significance requires careful planning and strategic positioning to maximize both financial returns and the likelihood that cars reach appropriate buyers rather than simply the deepest pockets. Auction houses including RM Sotheby's, Bonhams, and Gooding and Company have all expressed interest in handling the sale, with the final selection likely depending on which house offers the most compelling marketing strategy and demonstrated ability to attract serious Porsche collectors.\n\nThe timing of the auction matters enormously. Major classic car auction events including RM Sotheby's Amelia Island event in March, the Monaco Historic Grand Prix auctions in May, and the Monterey Car Week sales in August attract different buyer demographics and generate different price levels for similar cars. Strategic placement across multiple events rather than dumping the entire collection at once would likely maximize returns while generating sustained media attention.\n\nThe documentation Walker has assembled over decades of ownership adds substantial value to each car. Provenance records, maintenance histories, acquisition documentation, and photographs showing each car's condition over time provide buyers with confidence that purchases represent genuine examples rather than misrepresented or fraudulently documented vehicles. This documentation becomes increasingly important as values rise and buyers invest six or seven-figure sums based partly on trust in provenance claims.\n\n# What This Means For The Market\n\nWalker's collection sale represents a significant event in the classic Porsche market regardless of individual car results. The volume of desirable material entering auction simultaneously could create pricing pressure on specific models, particularly if multiple examples of similar specification compete for the same pool of serious collectors.\n\nHowever, the rarity of seeing a collection of this quality and significance dispersed through auction creates opportunity rather than purely downward pressure. Collectors who have wanted specific cars for years, waiting for examples with the right specification, history, and condition to appear, will find unusual opportunities within Walker's dispersal.\n\nThe sale also functions as a market benchmark, establishing current valuations for dozens of significant Porsche models simultaneously. Dealers, insurers, and collectors will reference Walker's results when assessing values of similar cars in their own portfolios, making the auction outcomes influential beyond the individual transactions.\n\n# The Cultural Significance\n\nBeyond financial and market considerations, Magnus Walker's collection sale represents something larger about automotive culture and its relationship with physical objects in an increasingly digital world.\n\nWalker spent decades assembling cars that represent Porsche's greatest moments of design and engineering. Each vehicle in his collection embodies specific decisions made by specific engineers at specific moments when Porsche pushed boundaries of what sports cars could be. The 911 RS represented homologation obsession taken to its logical extreme. The early 911s captured the moment when Porsche's identity crystallized around rear-engine sports car perfection. The 356s preserved the brand's origins in Ferdinand Porsche's original vision.\n\nThese cars aren't museum pieces. They're meant to be driven, experienced, and loved by people who understand what makes them special. Walker built his collection not to display wealth but to preserve and celebrate automotive achievement that deserves reverence.\n\nWhoever acquires these cars inherits not just vehicles but responsibility for maintaining them, driving them, and keeping them alive as functional expressions of automotive art rather than static investments sitting in climate controlled garages accumulating value without purpose.\n\nWalker's willingness to let go of cars he's loved for decades reflects genuine understanding of what these vehicles represent. They existed before he owned them. They'll exist long after he's forgotten. His role was custodian rather than owner, preserving them through one chapter of their existence before passing them to the next custodian who will cherish them equally.\n\nThe automotive world watches Magnus Walker's collection disperse with the same reverence it watches great art collections sell. These aren't merely cars. They're cultural artifacts that represent humanity's finest achievement in combining engineering, design, and emotional connection into machines that move us, literally and figuratively, in ways nothing else quite manages.\n\nWhether Walker feels liberation or loss when the last Porsche leaves his garage, he's created something that endures beyond ownership. The cars he found, saved, restored, and loved will continue inspiring enthusiasm and passion in whoever drives them next. That legacy matters more than any auction result, and it's the one thing no hammer price can ever diminish.",

    "text": "Apologies in advance for the long post, but looking for any help or guidance here.\n\nI bought into a Chrome Update break on Fanatics Live on December 14th. One of the cards I hit was a Marcelo Mayer Radiating Rookies Superfractor Auto redemption card. As a lifelong Red Sox, obviously I was floored. Fast-forward to a week later, it never arrives. USPS tracking showed that it was \"pending delivery.\" I inquired at the post office, they weren't able to find it, so it's lost. I reached out to Fanatics Support via phone, was told that I'd have to reach out to Fanatics LIVE support, of which there is no phone or chat support, only email. I got a response back (spoiler alert, the ONLY response I've received throughout this issue) that I'd need to file a claim with USPS and then they'd be able to resolve pending the claim outcome. I did as instructed, USPS deemed it lost and unretrievable, and I forwarded as much to Fanatics Live. Complete radio silence onward. Not even a \"we're looking into this\" type message, just nothing, despite 3-4 separate tickets on the issue.\n\nMy thought is that since Fanatics is the manufacturer and distributor here, they should be able to verify that I'm entitled to the card, that the shipment is lost, that it hasn't been redeemed by me, and that they should be able to provide some alternative method of redemption, but this seems too tall a task. Fanatics boasts their \"Fanatics ONE\" account experience of a unified account across all their platforms, but their customer service couldn't be more disparate. I called into Fanatics (not Live) support this morning to see if they could maybe get in touch with Live to escalate or something and was told they have no connection whatsoever with Fanatics Live and wouldn't be able to help and was advised to just spam the email or complain on social media. Unbelievable that this is their recommendation. By nothing they are ensuring only two possible outcomes:\n\n1. A superfractor rookie autograph card never see the light of day\n2. The card is somehow redeemed by someone who has no right to it.\n\nAnyway, I guess the learning experience here is either don't break with Fanatics Live or be sure to insure big hits or get overnight shipping. I hadn't had any issue with fulfillment prior to this so it didn't occur to me at the time. \n\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated.",

Kirk looks something like Rick Springfield, and I was always jealous of him for always having the girls flock around him.\n\n\n\n5. Barclay Shaw “Shockwave Rider” Paperback Cover Painting Illustration Original Art—Barclay is one of my closest friends and a GREAT guy. I know I sound like a broken record saying I love so many artist’s work, but I love Barclay’s paintings. He is also an amazing sculptor, and his paintings always look sculpted to me. My wife Cathleen bought this for me directly from Barclay years ago, and it has hung on my studio wall ever since. He got involved with pre-visualizations for DARPA years ago, so his illustration work became more scarce. We worked together in an ill-fated video game project with Alan Dean Foster, and we became even closer friends enduring the ups and downs of that project.\n\n\n\n6. Miro Sinovcic “Regulator #3 Deadly Justice” Wraparound Paperback Cover Illustration Original Art—I met Miro when I first moved to New York, and we both attended each other’s weddings.

    "text": "The Grand Tour presenter offloads classics from his collection including a Ferrari, Porsche, and two British icons as he reshuffles his garage.\n\nRichard Hammond, the television presenter best known for The Grand Tour and formerly Top Gear, is selling four vehicles from his personal collection through specialist dealers and auction houses in early 2026. The cars span decades and continents, from 1960s British sports cars to modern Italian exotics, reflecting Hammond's eclectic automotive tastes developed through years of driving virtually every significant car produced for television audiences worldwide.\n\nThe sale doesn't represent financial distress or collection liquidation. Instead, Hammond described the decision as \"making room for new obsessions\" in comments to automotive publications, suggesting the departures create space for different vehicles that currently interest him. For collectors and Hammond fans, the sales offer rare opportunities to own cars with documented celebrity provenance and, in some cases, appearances in television programmes that introduced millions to these vehicles.\n\n# 1969 Porsche 911T\n\nThe oldest vehicle in the sale, a 1969 Porsche 911T finished in Light Ivory with black interior, represents Hammond's appreciation for air-cooled Porsche engineering and classic sports car purity. The T designation indicated the base model 911 of that era, producing 110 horsepower from its 2.0-litre flat six engine, substantially less than the contemporary 911S's 170 horsepower but offering the same basic driving experience in more affordable packaging.\n\nHammond purchased the car approximately eight years ago and has used it regularly for weekend driving and classic car events. The odometer shows roughly 78,000 miles, respectable mileage for a 57-year-old vehicle suggesting regular use rather than garage hibernation. Service records document consistent maintenance at Porsche specialists, with recent work including engine rebuild, brake system overhaul, and suspension refresh totaling approximately £35,000 over Hammond's ownership.\n\nThe car is being offered through Romans International, a specialist dealer in Surrey, with an asking price of £145,000. This positions it in the middle range for early long-wheelbase 911s, which vary from £80,000 for project cars requiring restoration to over £200,000 for concours-condition examples with impeccable provenance.\n\nAir-cooled 911 values have appreciated substantially over the past decade as collectors recognized these cars as the last purely mechanical Porsches before electronics, turbocharging, and water cooling transformed the model into something fundamentally different. The T model, once overlooked as the poverty-spec 911, has gained appreciation as offering the purest driving experience without the power and complexity that later, faster variants added.\n\nHammond's ownership adds modest premium to value, though celebrity provenance matters less for classic cars than for modern collectibles. Buyers purchasing 1960s Porsches prioritize condition, originality, and driving experience over previous ownership, making Hammond's stewardship relevant primarily as assurance of proper maintenance rather than as value multiplier in itself.\n\n# 2005 Ferrari F430\n\nThe F430 represents Hammond's ownership of a model that featured extensively during his Top Gear tenure, though this specific car never appeared on the programme. Finished in Rosso Corsa red with tan leather interior, it exemplifies the classic Ferrari colour combination that works on virtually every model the company produces.\n\nThe F430, produced from 2004 to 2009, marked Ferrari's transition from the 360 Modena to more modern designs incorporating Formula 1 technology including electronic differential and manettino driver mode selector. Its 4.3-litre V8 produced 483 horsepower, delivering 0 to 60 mph in approximately 4.0 seconds and a top speed of 196 mph, performance that seemed extraordinary in 2005 but has since been surpassed by mainstream performance cars.\n\nHammond's F430 shows 31,000 miles, higher than typical for Ferraris of this era but still modest for a 21-year-old car. The service history includes annual maintenance at Ferrari-approved specialists with major service completed in 2024 including timing belt replacement and clutch renewal, significant expenses totaling approximately £8,000 that the next owner won't face for several years.\n\nThe car is being sold through specialist dealer Tom Hartley Jnr with an asking price of £115,000. F430 values have remained relatively stable over the past five years, trading in the £100,000 to £140,000 range depending on mileage, specification, and condition. The model represents an accessible entry to V8 Ferrari ownership, offering genuine supercar performance and Ferrari character without the seven-figure prices that earlier models including 360s and F355s have reached.\n\nThe F430's market position proves interesting. It's modern enough to be reliable and usable as regular transportation, lacking the fragility and constant maintenance demands of 1980s and 1990s Ferraris. However, it's old enough to have depreciated substantially from its original £120,000 list price, making it affordable for enthusiasts who couldn't justify new Ferrari purchases.\n\nHammond reportedly purchased the car in 2018 for approximately £105,000, meaning he's likely to achieve modest profit if the asking price is met. This reflects F430 values stabilizing after the depreciation curve flattened around 2015, with prices remaining relatively constant since as the model achieved modern classic status.\n\n# 1968 Lotus Elan S4\n\nThe Elan represents Hammond's documented appreciation for Colin Chapman's lightweight philosophy and British sports car character. The S4 variant, produced from 1968 to 1971, represented the final evolution of the original Elan design before the Plus 2 and Europa took Lotus in different directions.\n\nFinished in white with black interior, Hammond's Elan features the 1.6-litre twin-cam engine producing 115 horsepower, modest power that nonetheless delivered sparkling performance thanks to the car's 680-kilogram weight. The Elan pioneered the backbone chassis that Lotus used for decades, combined with fiberglass bodywork that avoided the rust issues plaguing contemporary steel-bodied British sports cars.\n\nHammond has owned the Elan for approximately twelve years, making it one of his longest-held vehicles. He's referenced it frequently in columns and interviews as exemplifying why lightweight matters more than power, a philosophy Hammond embraced enthusiastically during his television career.\n\nThe car shows 67,000 miles and benefits from comprehensive restoration completed approximately six years ago including chassis refurbishment, engine rebuild, and interior retrim. Total restoration costs reportedly exceeded £40,000, substantial investment in a car worth perhaps £35,000 to £45,000 depending on market conditions.\n\nThe Elan is being offered through classic car dealer E-Type UK, specialists in British sports cars, with an asking price of £48,000. This prices it at the top end of Elan S4 values, justified by the comprehensive restoration and Hammond's ownership adding modest provenance premium.\n\nElan values have appreciated steadily over the past decade as collectors recognized them as among the finest-driving classic British sports cars, offering handling and involvement that contemporary MGs and Triumphs couldn't match. However, values remain modest compared to E-Types and other iconic British sports cars, making Elans accessible to enthusiasts rather than purely investment buyers.\n\n# 2014 Porsche 911 GT3\n\nThe newest vehicle in the sale, a 2014 Porsche 911 GT3 in Guards Red, represents Hammond's ownership of a modern performance icon that bridges classic naturally aspirated engines and contemporary chassis technology. The 991-generation GT3 produced 475 horsepower from its 3.8-litre flat six, achieving 0 to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds while maintaining the driver engagement and mechanical purity that GT3 models exemplify.\n\nHowever, this particular GT3 carries controversial history. The 991 GT3 suffered from engine fires caused by faulty fasteners in some engines, prompting Porsche to recall the entire production run and replace engines in affected vehicles. Hammond's car received a replacement engine under the recall, though this history affects values despite Porsche's comprehensive fix.\n\nThe car shows 18,000 miles, relatively high for a GT3 given many owners treat them as garage queens driven sparingly. Hammond apparently used the car as Porsche intended, enjoying the performance and driving experience rather than preserving it purely as investment.\n\nService history documents annual maintenance at Porsche Centers with no issues beyond the engine replacement. The car features desirable options including carbon ceramic brakes, lifting system for speed bump clearance, and sports exhaust, specification that adds substantial value over base GT3 pricing.\n\nThe asking price through specialist dealer Paul Stephens is £145,000. This prices the car below current market rates for 991 GT3s, which typically trade from £160,000 to £200,000 depending on mileage and specification. The discount likely reflects the engine replacement history, which some buyers view negatively despite Porsche's thorough resolution of the problem.\n\nGT3 values have appreciated substantially over the past five years as collectors recognized these cars as the last naturally aspirated GT3s before turbocharging arrived with the 991.2 generation. The combination of modern performance, classic engine character, and Porsche's GT3 racing heritage makes them increasingly collectible.\n\n# Why Sell Now?\n\nHammond hasn't disclosed specific motivations beyond vague references to making room for new interests. However, several factors might influence the timing. Classic car values have remained strong through 2025 despite economic headwinds affecting other luxury markets, creating favorable conditions for sellers.\n\nThe specific cars being sold suggest Hammond might be consolidating his collection toward particular eras or manufacturers rather than maintaining diverse representation across decades and countries. Selling both Porsches, the Ferrari, and the Lotus while reportedly retaining other vehicles hints at shifting collecting focus.\n\nTax considerations might play roles, though Hammond's financial advisers would need to structure sales carefully to minimize capital gains liability on vehicles that have appreciated during his ownership. The Porsche 911T and Lotus Elan likely show substantial gains if Hammond purchased them at 2016-2018 prices, while the F430 and GT3 may have appreciated modestly or remained stable.\n\nCelebrity car collections often churn as owners' interests evolve and garage space limitations force choices about which vehicles to keep versus which to sell to fund new acquisitions. Hammond reportedly maintains a substantial collection beyond these four vehicles, suggesting the sales represent normal collection management rather than wholesale liquidation.\n\n# What This Means for Buyers\n\nThe Hammond provenance adds modest value through documented maintenance, assurance that cars were properly cared for rather than neglected, and the cachet of owning vehicles from a known enthusiast's collection. However, buyers should evaluate these cars primarily on their individual merits rather than celebrity ownership.\n\nThe pricing appears reasonable across all four vehicles, with asking prices reflecting fair market values given condition, history, and specifications. None seems dramatically overpriced to exploit Hammond's celebrity, suggesting the cars will sell based on fundamentals rather than purely on provenance premium.\n\nBuyers considering these vehicles should conduct normal due diligence including pre-purchase inspections by specialists, verification of service history claims, and assessment of whether prices align with current market rates for comparable examples. Celebrity ownership provides interesting backstory but shouldn't override practical evaluation of mechanical condition and value.\n\nThe sales also offer insights into which cars Hammond chose to part with versus retain. The diversity of the four departing vehicles suggests he's keeping an equally diverse collection, maintaining representation across eras and styles while simply rotating specific examples. For enthusiasts, this provides rare transparency into how a well-known car person manages a collection over time, making choices about which cars matter enough to keep versus which can be released to make room for new obsessions.\n\nWhether those new obsessions involve other classics, modern performance cars, or entirely different automotive directions remains unknown. But given Hammond's decades of driving virtually everything significant on four wheels, whatever replaces these four departures in his garage will almost certainly prove interesting when eventually revealed.",

    "text": "# 1966 Daimler V8 250\n\n**At a Glance: Recent Bodywork Restoration | Rebuilt Gearbox | Beautiful Condition**\n\nFor hundreds of photos and videos, as well as a detailed write up, click here: [https://www.tradeclassics.com/auctions/daimler/1966-daimler-v8-250/](https://www.tradeclassics.com/auctions/daimler/1966-daimler-v8-250/)\n\n**Fixed price: £18,950**\n\nThe Daimler V8 250 represents one of the finest examples of British motoring heritage, blending timeless elegance with refined performance. Introduced in 1962, the 250 was Daimler’s version of the Jaguar Mk2, sharing much of its graceful styling and engineering but distinguished by subtle design cues, including the signature fluted Daimler grille.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the 250 had evolved into a more luxurious saloon, combining the sporting appeal of the Mk2’s handling with Daimler’s focus on refinement and comfort. Its leather-trimmed cabin, polished wood veneers and elegant proportions made it a favourite among those seeking understated prestige without sacrificing driving enjoyment.\n\nOwned by our vendor Terry for the past three and a half years, it's clear to see that he has thoroughly cherished the Daimler following a full body restoration when he purchased the car.\n\n*We’ve carried out our usual seller checks, including verifying photo ID, the V5C and an HPI check. This confirms the car has not been stolen, written off or has any outstanding finance. Please note: this check does not include mileage verification.*\n\n*We’ve visited this car, taken the images and written the description below – we’ve also verified the seller’s ID and actioned a HPi report –* [*learn more*](https://www.tradeclassics.com/buy-a-classic-car)",

This is the silver Hilfiger‑branded display with the yellow GBC mounted in the center, originally used in Tommy Hilfiger stores as a promo piece rather than sold to the public.\n\nPhotos: https://imgur.com/a/5JHRFZm\n\nConsoleVariations documents this exact kiosk and estimates only about 100–500 units were ever produced, giving it a very high rarity score as an official limited release.\n\nTo give a sense of value: Heritage Auctions sold a brand‑new, boxed example of this same kiosk for 5,760 USD in 2022, which you can verify in their archived lot description (links posted below). A more recent private purchase documented in an unboxing video shows a mint boxed kiosk changing hands for around 1,500 USD shipped.\n\nMy unit is in good vintage condition overall. The kiosk shows light scuffs and typical wear from age and handling, but the colors and logos still present really well on display. There are no cracks or structural damage. The original box has edge and corner wear, yet it’s intact and still does its job protecting the kiosk. I’m happy to send detailed close‑ups of any area and a video walk‑around so you can judge the condition yourself.\n\nBecause of the documented rarity and the sales mentioned above, I’m asking \\*\\*$4,500 OBO\\*\\*. I’m open to reasonable, well‑explained offers (especially from serious collectors who’ve been hunting this piece and understand how seldom a boxed example appears).\n\nI’m located in Pensacola, Florida (Panhandle). Local pickup is strongly preferred due to size and value, but I can ship within the \\*\\*US ONLY.\\*\\* If shipped, it will be professionally packed, fully insured for the agreed price, and sent with signature confirmation.\n\nFor payment, I’ll take cash in person for local pickup, or PayPal Goods & Services for shipped deals so both sides have protection. I’ll provide packing photos, tracking, and any documentation you’d like from the references mentioned above.\n\nIf you’re interested, send me a DM and I’ll share a full photo set and videos.\n\nHere are the key references and sources that back up the rarity, past sales and background of this kiosk:\n\n• Heritage sale: https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/other/game-boy-color-tabletop-kiosk-brand-new-tommy-hilfiger-edition-gbc-nintendo-1999-usa\n\n• Rarity info: https://consolevariations.com/collectibles/nintendo-game-boy-color-tommy-hilfiger-kiosk\n\n• Nintendo Gameboy Color Tommy Hilfiger Kiosk - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCx7KQNQ7WU\n\n• Rare Tommy Hilfiger Game Boy Color tabletop kiosk-  https://www.cllct.com/sports-collectibles/auctions/rare-game-boy-color-tommy-hilfiger-tabletop-kiosk-headed-to-auction",

    "text": "Hello everyone! I’m back with more obscure hobby drama! I discovered this topic by browsing wikipedia- it was one of the daily highlights on the front page. Anyway...enjoy!\n\n**What is a chair?**\n\nIn the simplest terms, a chair is a piece of furniture you sit on.\n\nBut what else can a chair be? Can a chair be a status symbol? A metaphor for cultural division? A prime target for smugglers?\n\nWhat if a chair is ALL of those things.\n\n**Indian independence and Chandigarh**\n\n[After World War II](https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/independence-and-partition-1947), Great Britain gave India its long awaited independence. In [1947](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-62467438), due to religious and political tensions, it hastily split its Indian territory into two countries: India and Pakistan.\n\nThe result was a mess. Between 200,000 and a million people died, and tens of thousands of women suffered rape and other atrocities as a result of the botched partition. Pakistan and India have [fought wars](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-62467438) over Kashmir, the region at the centre of their tenuous shared border. There are still [lingering tensions ](https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/independence-and-partition-1947)between them today.\n\nJawarharlal Nehru, [the new prime minister of India](https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-chandigarh-chair), also had to contend with the fact that Lahore, the capital of Punjab- another region on the Indian-Pakistan border- was now located in Pakistan. Thus he decided to do the logical thing: build a new cutting edge capital for Punjab. It was called [Chandigarh](https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-chandigarh-chair).\n\n>Nehru wanted Chandigarh to be a city \"unfettered by the traditions of the past\" and “a model for our glorious future growth of the country”.\n\nHe hired two British architects, a couple- Jane Drew and Maxwell Fry, who in turn hired Le Corbusier, a renowned Swiss-French architect, to help them design the city. In yet another turn, Le Corbusier hired his cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, to help him on the project. Jeanneret would oversee the construction site on the ground, with [help from local architects and designers](https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-chandigarh-chair).\n\n\\>Nehru wanted the project to be a 'living school' for a new generation of Indian architects and he stipulated that the Europeans must train local architects on the job, rather than bringing their own staff with them.\n\nThe most notable of these architects was a woman called [Eulie Chowdhury](https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-chandigarh-chair). Thanks to her fathers diplomatic career, she had travelled across the world in her youth and even studied overseas. She knew French- allowing her to forge a close working relationship with Corbusier and Jeanneret. She helped Jeanneret design several buildings in Chandigarh, and even designed several herself. Later in life, she held a number of important offices in India, including Chief Architect of Chandigarh and Chief Architect of Punjab.\n\nJeanneret and his team also designed most of the furniture in Chandigarh.\n\nIncluding one very sexy chair.\n\n**The Chandigarh Chair**\n\nPicture this-\n\nWait, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, we can quite literally picture it:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkyyf6q5c3fg1.jpg?width=991&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3f41623875bf1f2b445722da6870c59d5ba9e07\n\nLike all the furniture Jeanneret and his team designed, the chairs were manufactured locally, with [local materials ](https://collectiononline.design-museum.de/#/en/object/40354?_k=wfosyz)(such as teak, sissoo (Indian rosewood), and [cane mesh](https://www.cntraveller.in/story/scrap-in-india-star-abroad-the-chandigarh-chair-is-a-hot-mesh/)). Jeanneret also [didn’t patent](https://www.cntraveller.in/story/scrap-in-india-star-abroad-the-chandigarh-chair-is-a-hot-mesh/) any of the designs, letting them be used in government and public buildings across India in the 50s and 60s.\n\n>“At the time, the concept of a chair was very alien to the aesthetic of the Indian [home](https://www.cntraveller.in/story/this-four-bedroom-home-in-jaipur-is-an-ode-to-the-pink-city/) because we used to sit on the floor or had seating like *khatiyas* and *mooras*,” points out architect Ashiesh Shah. “Corbusier and Jeanneret understood the hardiness of Indian materiality and the need for slim forms that we see on these chairs, the legs of which were ironically inspired by a compass—the quintessential tool of an architect, playing such a specific role in every design. And if you go to Chandigarh, you’ll see the buildings there also inspired by similar designs. The duo’s role in starting the movement of modernism in Indian design is so important. Till then, we only had colonial designs taking over our landscape, such as Indo-Saracenic, Gothic, Regency, and the like. They created a distinct, minimalist aesthetic that was so indigenous to our climate and materials, and also what we could afford. So this chair is a symbol of this rich design history.”\n\nUnfortunately, while Jeanneret’s role has been recognised over the years, Chowdhury and other Indian designers and architects [have not enjoyed the same recognition](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/chandigarh/standing-out-remembering-eulie-chowdhury-the-only-indian-woman-architect-in-le-corbusiers-chandigarh-project-team-553396/):\n\n>“However, unlike Corbusier, the Indian architects were apparently not as keen on claiming authorship. As a result, their work continues to be overshadowed by the Western architects who worked here. In the absence of archival documentation, it is difficult to ascertain the extent of her involvement but we know that the Chandigarh team had a highly collaborative structure and that several Indian architects were involved in the making of the furniture.”\n\nWhat we do known is that Chowdhury [managed the production of the furniture](https://archive.is/5eAqb#selection-2413.0-2413.450):\n\n>According to Casciato, the job of managing the furniture production fell to a young architect named Eulie Chowdhury. Fluent in Punjabi, French and English, “she was basically the go-between,” Casciato says. “They had, let’s say, a kind of network, and she was extremely important in creating that network and supporting the production and all the detailing.” Chowdhury even shared a design credit with Jeanneret, for an X-base chair with a wood back.\n\nShe also adapted Jeanneret’s designs to better fit [Indian physiques](https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/the-chandigarh-chair):\n\n>Jeanneret's own designs used the dimensions of Le Corbusier’s modular system – a universal system of proportions based on the height of an average French man (initially 1.75 metres and later increased to 1.83 metres), which underpinned much of the planning and detailing of all his projects in Chandigarh. Eulie Chowdhury carefully reconsidered and adapted these proportions to create furniture more suitable for smaller, potentially female statures.\n\nJeanneret himself acknowledged the role of the Indian designers:\n\n>As Casciato sees it, Jeanneret himself was quite clear on the question of authorship with his designs: They also belonged to the local artisans who constructed them by hand. “Many times, everywhere, Pierre said that he not only respected but was learning from his Indian experience,” she says. “So, for him, a hundred percent they are attributed to India. They are Indian made.\n\nAfter the project ended, Jeanneret [remained in India](https://archive.is/5eAqb):\n\n>Jeanneret fell in love with India and its people. He stayed on in Chandigarh for 13 years, well beyond the scope of his initial commitment, and was appointed head of the Chandigarh College of Architecture in the early 1960s. When his health began to falter in 1965, he moved to Geneva, where he died two years later. His ashes were scattered over Chandigarh’s Lake Sukhna.\n\n30 years later…\n\n**A new millennium and a new style**\n\nBy the late 1990s, the sleek and sexy Chandigarh chair, along with most of the other furniture created by Jeanneret, Chowdhury, and the others, was out of fashion. Therefore the Chandigarh administration replaced them with cheaper, [mass-produced](https://www.1stdibs.com/introspective-magazine/pierre-jeanneret/) goods, leaving them to rot in warehouses and junkyards, or even worse, selling them off for firewood.\n\nWord reached Europe. Especially the French. Soon, [Parisian art dealers](https://archive.is/5eAqb) made their way to Chandigarh, buying up as much of the furniture as they could lay their froggy little hands on. The most notable of these was Eric Touchaleaume, owner of Galerie 54, who [confirmed](https://www.1stdibs.com/introspective-magazine/pierre-jeanneret/): “I was able to buy very large quantities (of furniture) at auctions organized by the administration.” At the time, India’s export laws classified antiques as objects that were [over a hundred years old](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/world/asia/19chandigarh.html), meaning the dealers faced no opposition in taking the furniture out of the country.\n\nThe dealers squirrelled their new treasures back to France, where they refurbished them- sometimes by [as much as 40%](https://archive.is/5eAqb)\\- in preparation for sale. François Laffanour, a dealer who started selling the restored pieces, [commented](https://archive.is/5eAqb):\n\n>“People were responding very fast,” says Laffanour, who’d been worried that the furniture would come across as too rustic. “It was surprising to me to see how positive the response was, especially for the armchair.” He concluded that functionality was a big part of its appeal. “Prouvé and Perriand specialized in bookcases, tables, desks—but sofas, comfortable armchairs, there was no production. It was missing in the apartments of our collectors. We had the opportunity to sell something that was comfortable and affordable. That was also part of the success.”\n\nIt took years for the authorities in Chandigarh to realise the [cultural worth](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/world/asia/19chandigarh.html) of the furniture and what they had lost:\n\n>Rajnish Wattas, principal of the Chandigarh College of Architecture, was stunned when he saw the catalog for a sale at Christie’s New York last June, titled “Chandigarh.”\n\n>“We found out that we were sitting on a pot of gold, quite literally,” he said. “But the dealers had realized much earlier that there was big money to be made.”\n\n>There was nothing illegal about the purchase by foreign dealers of the furniture, much of which was being thrown out or sold by the city’s administration. But very belatedly, heritage experts in Chandigarh are lamenting the loss of a vital part of the city’s original design.\n\n>\"It is a tragic misunderstanding,” Mr. Wattas said. “I wish the scandal had come out earlier and then maybe we could have clung on to much more than we have now.” Last fall, he founded Chandigarh’s Heritage Furniture Committee, in an attempt to archive the remaining stocks of the Jeanneret designs. But little progress has been made.\n\n>Gradually, as the furniture fell into disrepair, it was thrown into government storerooms and occasionally auctioned “for peanuts,” Mr. Wattas said, usually to local carpenters who broke it up and reused the increasingly expensive teak. “People wanted new and glossy stuff: synthetic leather, Scandinavian design, metallic furniture.”\n\nThe dealers [defended](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/world/asia/19chandigarh.html) [their](https://archive.is/5eAqb#selection-2447.0-2447.556) actions, saying they had rescued the furniture from certain destruction:\n\n>In an e-mail message from his Paris showroom, Galerie 54, he (Eric Touchaleaume) said that such was the level of neglect for Mr. Jeanneret’s designs that disused furniture was being chopped up for firewood. “I always paid on average 100 times more than what the local dealers were offering,”\n\n>Laffanour speaks eloquently for the defense. “It’s only because dealers have this kind of interest—of course they think they can make a profit—but also they have the patience” to hold onto material until the fashion cycle revolves, he points out. “Because you are working on something which is totally rejected by everybody. You have to believe in it. If you are really in the mood of the piece, it’s like your treasure. You feel like you are a little bit lonely with your treasure, because nobody wants to take it from you. But it’s also really exciting.”\n\n**An old style and a new appreciation**\n\nOver the years, auction prices have risen sharply for refurbished Chandigarh furniture, largely thanks to the efforts of the French dealers in [advertising and hyping up the pieces](https://archive.is/5eAqb#selection-2471.355-2475.192). In [2006](https://archive.is/5eAqb), some armchairs from the Chandigarh senate building sold for $12,000, but by 2019, the price had increased to $30,000.\n\n[Some other pieces have sold for much more](https://www.1stdibs.com/introspective-magazine/pierre-jeanneret/):\n\n>On 1stdibs, Chandigarh offerings include a [set of six library chairs](https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/seating/chairs/pierre-jeanneret-library-chair-ca-1959-1960/id-f_7116563/) from [Galerie Patrick Seguin](https://www.1stdibs.com/dealers/galerie-patrick-seguin/), priced at over $100,000. The same sum will buy a pair of teak easy chairs from Luxembourg’s [Galerie Denoyelle Europe](https://www.1stdibs.com/dealers/galerie-denoyell-europe/) (they have been reupholstered, a fact made clear by the gallery’s [photo of them in their previous state of disrepair](https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/seating/armchairs/upholstered-sofa-easy-chair-pierre-jeanneret/id-f_12904722/)). For those without $100,000 to spend, Zurich’s [P! Galerie](https://www.1stdibs.com/dealers/p-galerie/) is offering a [simple wooden library chair](https://www.1stdibs.com/furniture/seating/chairs/pierre-jeanneret-library-chair-from-chandigarh-pj-si-51/id-f_7182543/) (listed as restored in 2016 but with original woodwork and screws) for $4,075. Graetsch currently has 19 Chandigarh items on display at [MDFG](https://www.1stdibs.com/dealers/mdfg/), his street-level gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn (and on 1stdibs), ranging from an iconic ca. 1955 V-leg office armchair ($8,000) to a 1955–56 sofa set designed for the High Court and Assembly ($150,000).\n\nOver time, some in India have challenged the role of the French dealers in \"rescuing\" the furniture, asserting that they [tactfully ](https://darknlight.com/projects/article/the-chandigarh-chair-exploring-the-nuances-of-a-revival/)released the refurbished pieces in a slow trickle, carefully crafting a narrative of the furniture’s scarcity and rarity to justify their high prices.\n\nIn [2010](https://www.epoch-magazine.com/post/modernist-design-from-chandigarh-to-christies), Touchleaume and another of the original dealers wrote a book called “*The Indian Adventure: Design, Art, Architecture”, in which they rhapsodised further about their roles in saving the furniture. This too was* [*heavily criticised*](https://www.epoch-magazine.com/post/modernist-design-from-chandigarh-to-christies)*:*\n\n>One particular publication was foundational in the elaboration of this now-popular narrative. Le Corbusier, Pierre Jeanneret: L'AventureIndienne: Design, Art, Architecture (The Indian Adventure: Design, Art, Architecture) (2010), by Eric Touchaleaume and Gérald Moreau, the very dealers who initially removed much of the furniture from Chandigarh, has become the principal text of reference for dealers, auction houses and collectors alike. Alongside biographies of Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret and black and white archival images of both men at work, this large and expensive book recounts the dealers’ own travels to India, positioning themselves as the saviours of the furniture, depicting scenes of disused stacks of chairs in inconsistently captioned photographs.\n\n>Notably, the last 76 pages of *The Indian Adventure* contain an inventory of Chandigarh’s furniture compiled by the dealers, listing many different forms of chairs, tables, and lamps divided into categories, devised by the dealers. *The Indian Adventure* contains only a short bibliography, with few references tying particular claims within the text or the inventory to specific and/or accessible primary evidence. Even before its publication, *The Indian Adventure* and particularly its inventory served as the sole reference and proof of claims made about Chandigarh furniture within auction listings.\n\nEven worse, sometimes auction houses and dealers [downplay](https://www.epoch-magazine.com/post/modernist-design-from-chandigarh-to-christies) the role of Chowdhury and the other Indian designers in the creation of the furniture, focusing only on the Corbusier/Jeanneret connection to push prices up even further. [Fake pieces](https://archive.is/5eAqb) have also made their way into the marketplace, further muddying the waters.\n\nBecause of this, it’s hard to [authenticate the furniture](https://archive.is/5eAqb):\n\n>Conservative estimates put the original production of Chandigarh furniture at roughly 30,000 pieces, but the number is devilishly difficult to pin down because the most common models were produced continuously for almost 30 years—and then as needed, when a shelf’s joints loosened or a chair’s cane seat blew out. Within the past decade, inmates at the central jail in Chandigarh have made new batches of chairs. Authenticating the objects is also no easy task. “If Jeanneret lived to be a thousand, they couldn’t make that much furniture,” says Reed Krakoff, a longtime art and design collector and the chief artistic officer of Tiffany & Co. Krakoff admires Jeanneret’s Chandigarh material; 12 years ago, he bought a major-league library table at [Sotheby’s](https://archive.is/o/5eAqb/https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/BID) that he still loves and uses. But he’s lost trust in the market. “I know for a fact there are people still making this furniture,” he says pointedly. “And they’ll leave it out in the rain for a year so it looks old if you want that.”\n\nThere’s also the issue of ‘[gene-splicing](https://archive.is/5eAqb#selection-2471.355-2475.191)’:\n\n>Michael Jefferson of Christie’s says Jeanneret prices have vacillated but are largely holding firm. Acknowledging the influx of fakes, he nonetheless notes that “the spectrum of acceptance for restoration in Chandigarh material is very broad”—because so much of it was essentially pieced back together in the first place before hitting the sales floor.\n\n>“There are ethical questions,” he admits. He describes the practice of “gene-splicing,” where “you have one arm and you create a complete chair out of that. That’s wrong, and you can spot it.\n\nBy the late 2010s, the desire for Chandigarh furniture had risen to a fever pitch. Many furniture collectors, interior designers, and people who liked sexy chairs fell in love with the Chandigarh chair. The chairs[ ended up ](https://www.cntraveller.in/story/scrap-in-india-star-abroad-the-chandigarh-chair-is-a-hot-mesh/)in expensive villas and homes across the globe, appearing in multiple [designer magazines](https://archive.is/5eAqb). The most illustrious owner is probably Kourtney Kardashian, who showed off her own collection of chairs in a 2016 issue of *Architectural Digest:*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/19ht3hu1d3fg1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e53dee9daf52760bcc05d2aad243b54645f8bfdf\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5xzu1q2d3fg1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d159c904e9c03f477509dd8135526a05377844d8\n\nWow, what a privilege!\n\nEven modern reproductions [sell well](https://www.cntraveller.in/story/scrap-in-india-star-abroad-the-chandigarh-chair-is-a-hot-mesh/):\n\n>There are no exclusive licenses for the production of Chandigarh chairs, as Jeanneret \"never filed for patents or copyrights\". As their popularity has grown in the 21st-century, multiple studios across the world have produced their own versions.\n\n>Shah also points to current architects and aesthetes who have been responsible for bringing back an awareness of the beauty and importance of these pieces of furniture. While one can get an open-ended edition from brands like Phantom Hands, Cassina or Restoration Hardware, with prices ranging from Rs4,000 to Rs40,000, to rely on the provenance of the original would require relying on the authenticity of the [gallery](https://www.cntraveller.in/story/husain-raza-and-the-pope-walk-into-a-gallery-what-happened-before-and-after-is-art-history/). “And I don’t think anyone in India is currently selling an authentic piece,” he warns. He also advises that one cannot truly tell the difference between a fake or an original, since these pieces aren’t even a century old. “We’re not talking about antiques here. And there wasn’t much done at the time to formally document this work. We’ve only relied on oral history, and I think it’s mostly the furniture that was initially discovered and taken out of the country by the French gallerists that can probably be coined as the original,” he says.\n\n*….*\n\nThere are two versions of the Chandigarh story: in one, a group of French art dealers heroically rescue some underappreciated furniture from an ignorant administration and a destructive fate, while in the other, the same group of dealers knowingly and willingly took the furniture with the intention of restoring it and selling it off for a profit, while not bothering to inform the Chandigarh administration of the real cultural or financial worth of the items.\n\nMaybe both versions are true. Maybe neither of them are.\n\nBut some things are certain: today, Chandigarh furniture sells for tens of thousands, sometimes even hundreds of thousands, of dollars in foreign auction houses, and many pieces have a murky provenance.\n\nUnfortunately, this has led to rampant smuggling, and even death, back in India.\n\nThanks for reading part 1!\n\n[Full index of all of my Hobby Drama writeups](https://www.reddit.com/user/Tokyono/comments/z73vas/a_collection_of_all_of_my_hobby_drama_posts/)",

    "text": "One of the most popular complaints I see in the Hobby involves folks saying some form of “breakers get all the products”. Then, a hobby simp or Fanatics burner account will always chime in with “Fanatics has a public presale where you can always buy boxes at MSRP!”\n\nIs that \\*technically\\* true? Yes.\n\nHowever, my main question is what’s the actual allotment put aside for the public?\n\nMy theory is that Fanatics releases an EXTREMELY small number of boxes for the general public. I’m talking less than 5% of the total available inventory. It’s the one and only way you can explain how EVERY SINGLE RELEASE “sells out” within 90 seconds.\n\nFanatics wants you to believe it’s because millions and millions of people are flooding Topps.com or Fanatics.com and buying tens of thousands of cases.\n\nI think it’s because they release an extremely small amount of actual cases in a public release. That way they can pretend “everyone” has a fair shot at regular pricing, before the aftermarket monster takes hold and suddenly you’re paying 50% to 125% more for the same box.\n\nThen, after they offer all their preferred breakers a case or two at MSRP… they come back a week later and say “you’re entitled to another two cases, but now they are \\*market price\\*. Which means even breakers are now paying a 50% to 125% markup, which much like tariffs, those costs are passed on to who? You nailed it. The consumer.\n\n2025 Topps Cosmic Chrome is a perfect example. Fanatics had a “presale” at $335 a box I believe. Now? They are $625-$700 on all resale sites.\n\nI don’t even care that Fanatics is shady as fuck with their pricing. They’re a business. They can do whatever they want. What I wish happened, was that much like the lottery or casinos… they had to be 100% transparent about everything.\n\nThat way if they are only offering ten cases to the public, and then 10,000 cases to breakers… at least we know. And at that point can make a much better decision on what, if anything, we want to buy.\n\nAnd make no mistake… Fanatics is very much trying to eliminate the local card shop. Both of the ones I go to are both considering closing up shop, because their allotments are next to nothing, and then the only way they can even get more is via Fanatics at “market price”, or through BlowOut of Dave and Adam’s, who are more or less directly aligned with Fanatics.\n\nWhen your LCS can’t get product from the producer, it’s only a matter of time before the numbers no longer work to be profitable and stay open.\n\nAt that point, Fanatics will have completely destroyed the physical market, and if you want to stay in the Hobby, you have to deal with them directly (if you’re extremely lucky at presale), or what they REALLY want… is for you to have no choice but to buy directly from their Fanatics Live breakers.\n\nI hope I’m wrong.",

Curious how they compare in reality. Who brings more serious buyers for rare soccer cards?\n\n🔹 Experience & reliability — Communication, transparency, and overall consignment experience.\n\n🔹 Marketing/promotional guarantees — Placement in auctions, highlighted lots, etc.\n\nIf you’ve sold big soccer cards (especially high end Messi cards) on either of these platforms, I’d love to hear your experience and what you’d recommend.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "text": "I used to collect as a kid but as of last week I’m back in the hobby. Unfortunately, my reintroduction was through breakers on fanatics as I was unaware of how problematic breaking was (please don’t yell at me! I am now aware of how bad breaking is for the hobby and will not be breaking with card breakers going forward). Anyway, I got a decent hit off a case break. I got the card yesterday and it has damaged in the corner. I didn’t notice any damage on the live stream, nor did the streamer indicate that the cards in the case were damaged in any way. There was no damage to the shipping from what I could tell. The damage is to one corner of the card, and my guess would be that it was damaged while the breaker was loading the card based on how the corner looks.\n\nAnyway I messaged the shop that I purchased the spot in the case break through about the damage. They asked what they could do to make this right and I said send a comp card or refund my purchase entirely. They instead replied by saying they can send me an empty card package for the particular case and I can send it back to Topps. They said that they receive cards that are already dinged up, which I can understand. However, I don’t want to risk submitting a claim with topps for a damaged card because if they deny my claim I will be screwed, especially because I have 30 days from date of purchase to raise any issues with an order on fanatics live.\n\nAnyway, just looking for some advice from those that have dealt with receiving damaged cards from a break on fanatics live",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I used Claude to help write this post. If that bothers you please close your eyes. Ain’t no fucking way I’m writing a post like this from scratch, but I do think it’s a good pitch and should be considered. I’m here for good DD, if ai can help, why are we limiting ourselves from discussion?\n\n**TL;DR:** Collectors Holdings CEO sits on GameStop’s board for free. PE investors (including Steve Cohen’s family office) need an exit after 5 years. GameStop has $9B+ in cash. The same Steve Cohen who bailed out Melvin Capital in January 2021 may have no choice but to sell Ryan Cohen the dominant force in collectibles authentication.\n\n-----\n\n##The Board Seat That Doesn’t Make Sense (Unless It Does)\n\nIn November 2024, GameStop appointed Nat Turner—Chairman and CEO of Collectors Holdings—to its Board of Directors. One month earlier, GameStop became an authorized PSA dealer.\n\nRyan Cohen’s board is tight and hand-picked. You don’t get a seat for a dealer agreement.\n\nTurner receives no compensation for his board role. He’s the CEO of a company valued at $4.3 billion, sitting on GameStop’s board for free.\n\n**Why?** Because when this deal closes, he’ll be one of the largest GameStop shareholders.\n\n-----\n\n##What is Collectors Holdings?\n\nCollectors has quietly consolidated the entire collectibles authentication industry:\n\n|Brand  |Category              |Position                     |\n|-------|----------------------|-----------------------------|\n|PSA    |Trading cards         |#1 globally, 71% market share|\n|SGC    |Trading cards         |Acquired Feb 2024            |\n|Beckett|Trading cards & comics|Acquired Dec 2025            |\n|PCGS   |Coins & currency      |Industry leader              |\n|WATA   |Video games           |Industry leader              |\n|Goldin |Auction marketplace   |Premium collectibles         |\n\nAccording to GemRate, PSA graded 18.3+ million cards in 2025. **Combined with SGC and Beckett, Collectors now owns 79% of all card grading.**\n\nThey don’t dominate the market. They ARE the market.\n\n-----\n\n##The PE Exit Clock & Steve Cohen’s Problem\n\nIn February 2021, an investor group took Collectors Universe private for $853 million:\n\n- **Nat Turner** (sold Flatiron Health for $1.9B)\n- **D1 Capital Partners** (Dan Sundheim)\n- **Cohen Private Ventures** (Steve Cohen’s family office)\n- **The Chernin Group**\n\n**Read that again.** Steve Cohen’s family office.\n\nThe same Steve Cohen whose Point72 provided $750 million to bail out Melvin Capital during the January 2021 squeeze.\n\n**We are now exactly 5 years into the hold period.** PE funds typically exit within 5-7 years. The pressure to find liquidity is mounting.\n\nBy March 2022, Collectors raised $100 million at a $4.3 billion valuation—a 5x return in 13 months. They’re sitting on massive gains. They need an exit.\n\n-----\n\n##The Trap Steve Cohen Built for Himself\n\nHere’s the supreme irony:\n\n**January 2021:** Point72 deploys $750M to bail out Melvin Capital, trying to crush GameStop shareholders.\n\n**February 2021:** While GameStop shareholders are reeling, Cohen Private Ventures closes on Collectors Universe for $853M.\n\n**2021-2024:** Steve Cohen watches his Collectors investment multiply 5x as the company consolidates 80% of the grading market. Meanwhile, he probably assumed GameStop would fade into irrelevance.\n\n**2025-2026:** The PE exit clock is ticking. Cohen’s family office needs liquidity. And who’s sitting there with $9 billion in cash?\n\n*The same company he tried to destroy.*\n\nSteve Cohen didn’t just fail to kill GameStop. **He spent four years building the perfect acquisition target and now has to sell it to the guy whose shareholders he tried to crush.**\n\n-----\n\n##GameStop’s War Chest\n\nQ3 2025 actuals:\n\n|Metric                         |Value                        |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n|Cash & Marketable Securities   |$8.8 billion                 |\n|Bitcoin Holdings               |$519 million (~4,710 BTC)    |\n|Convertible Notes (0% interest)|~$4.2 billion (due 2030/2032)|\n|**Net Liquid Position**        |~$5 billion                  |\n\nGameStop didn’t raise $4.2 billion in 0% convertible notes to sit on cash earning interest. The SEC filings state proceeds are for “general corporate purposes” and “potential acquisitions.”\n\n-----\n\n##The Forcing Function\n\nCollectors’ investors face a difficult situation:\n\n1. **They need an exit.** Five years into the hold, LPs want liquidity.\n1. **IPO is complicated.** Congressman Pat Ryan has formally requested an FTC investigation into Collectors’ market consolidation. An IPO roadshow explaining 80% market share while regulators are circling is awkward.\n1. **Strategic buyers are limited.** Fanatics backs competitor CGC.

What better way than announcing the acquisition of a company that transforms GameStop from dying retailer to infrastructure layer for the entire collectibles economy?\n\n-----\n\n##What GameStop Becomes\n\n**Post-Acquisition:**\n\n- **Intake Network:** 2,000+ stores become PSA/SGC/Beckett submission points\n- **Authentication Monopoly:** 80% market share in card grading\n- **Vertical Integration:** Submit → Grade → Vault → Sell on Goldin. All in-house.\n- **Video Game Grading:** WATA is the leader—perfect fit\n- **High-Margin Business:** Grading runs 40%+ margins vs retail’s ~10%\n\nGameStop stops being a “meme stock” and becomes the trust and transaction layer for the entire collectibles economy.\n\n-----\n\n##The Bear Case\n\n- **Valuation uncertainty:** We don’t know if Collectors is $4B or $8B today\n- **FTC risk:** Regulatory scrutiny could complicate a deal\n- **Integration risk:** Retail + tech services mergers are hard\n- **Collectibles cyclicality:** The card market has cooled from 2021 peaks\n\n**Counterarguments:**\n\n- PE exit pressure creates motivated sellers\n- FTC concerns are about Collectors’ consolidation, not GameStop buying it\n- GameStop’s retail footprint is uniquely valuable to a grading company\n- The strategic fit is undeniable\n\n-----\n\n##Conclusion\n\nRyan Cohen didn’t put the CEO of a $4B+ company on his board for a dealer agreement.\n\nHe didn’t raise $4.2 billion in 0% convertible notes to earn interest.\n\nHe didn’t build a $9 billion war chest to watch it sit.\n\nThe PE investors didn’t hold for 5 years to walk away without an exit.\n\nAnd Steve Cohen’s family office didn’t expect their collectibles investment would end up in the hands of the guy whose shareholders they tried to destroy.\n\n**The acquisition target is Collectors Holdings. The timeline is 2026. And the man who tried to end GameStop gets to watch as he hands over the keys.**\n\n-----\n\n*This is not financial advice. Do your own research.*\n\n**Position: Long GME since 2019 and never sold a share*\n\n*Edit: Watch for announcements before the March/April 2026 shareholder meeting.

    "text": "**TLDR**\n\nTopps released the 2025 Black and White Set and did not include the the most anticipated and sought after hits (Golden Hours) in their \\~5,000 Pre-Order Boxes.  Instead, they packed them into the remaining Release Day Boxes.  Pre-Order buyers had a 0% chance to hit a Golden Hour.  Full analysis and data breakdown below.\n\nBefore you react or respond, know that with all the evidence available to myself, and frankly to everyone, it has become a forgone conclusion that this *did* occur.  There are, however, unanswered questions such as \"how\" this occurred and \"why\" Topps has not acknowledged the mishap, which has become self-evident.\n\n=======================  \n  \n**2025 Topps Black and White Collector’s Box Format**\n\nA 2025 Topps Black and White Collector’s Box contains 10 packs with 8 cards each.  The “hit” of each pack is located in the second to last card slot.  The 10 hits across the packs consist of the following:\n\n* 5 Numbered Cards /99 or lower (Note: Although the description states “4,” the boxes have 5 numbered parallels in them)\n* 1 Numbered Auto /99 or lower\n* 2 Legend Vault Base (#116-#125)\n* 1 SP or SSP Image Variation\n* 1 Prized Portaits Insert (Rare chance of being numbered)\n\n**Base Card Parallels**\n\nThe base card (including #116-#125) rainbow of parallels contains 265 total numbered per subject:\n\n* /99 Green Parallel\n* /75 Yellow Parallel\n* /50 Blue Parallel\n* /25 Purple Parallel\n* /10 Red Parallel\n* /5 Orange Parallel\n* /1 Full-Color Parallel\n\nThere are 125 Base subjects.  \nThis means there are **33,125** total Numbered Base Cards.\n\n**Insert Parallels**\n\nThe insert parallels have the following rainbow of parallels, which includes 41 numbered per subject:\n\n* /25 Purple Parallel\n* /10 Red Parallel\n* /5 Orange Parallel\n* /1 Full-Color Parallel\n\n*Rookie Resolution*  \n20 Subjects  \nThis means there are **820** total Numbered Rookie Resolution Cards.\n\n*Shutter Speed*  \n20 Subjects  \nThis means there are **820** total Numbered Shutter Speed Cards.\n\n*Frame Rate*  \n10 Subjects  \nThis means there are **410** total Numbered Frame Rate Cards.\n\nNOTE: Prized Portaits contain /25 and /1 Numbered Parallels, however they replace the Prized Portrait Hit in the box.  \n  \n**Total Numbered Parallels**\n\nThe Base, Rookie Resolution, Shutter Speed and Frame Rate Numbered Parallels are all in the observed “5 Numbered Per Box” pool.  \nWhen you combine the totals for each, that equates to 35,175 Numbered Parallels total.  \nWhen you divide that amount by 5 per box, the result is 7,035.  \nTotal Collector’s Edition Box Run: **\\~7,035 Boxes**\n\n**Golden Hour Parallels**\n\nThere are 20 Golden Hour subjects.  \nEach subject contains 50 Numbered cards.  \nThis means that there are a total of **1,000** Golden Hour cards.  \nLike Prized Portraits, these cards are not in the “5 Numbered per Box” pool.  \nThis means that 1 Golden Hour card should appear in **every \\~7.035 Collector’s Boxes**.  \nThis mostly aligns with the rate seen in previous years.\n\n=======================\n\n**The Pre-Order**\n\nOn November 6th, 2025, Topps dropped the pre-order for Black and White Collector’s Boxes and Cases, as well as the Mega Boxes.  At that time, Topps allowed you to view how much inventory was left for a given sku.  They have since removed that feature for the public (causing more transparency issues, of course).  Luckily, that data was able to be logged and here was the count:\n\n* 4,318 Collector’s Boxes\n* 50 Collector’s Cases (10 Boxes per Case)\n* 2,080 Mega Boxes\n\nThis means they provided a total of **4,818 Collector’s Boxes** in the pre-order.  \nThis is important, because given the above data, this leaves a remaining 2,217 Collector’s Boxes that could possibly be available.  \nWe also do not know how many of those 2,217 were distributed direct or via some other pre-order methodology, thus leaving the possibility that the remaining boxes could be much lower.  \nWe do know that **2,217** Collector's Boxes is the **maximum** remaining.\n\n**The Pre-Orders Ship**\n\nAfter about a month and a half, and a mysterious delay that bumped the “street date” from December 18th to December 23rd, the Pre-order boxes were shipped.  Instead of the usual “arrive by street date,” these were actually *shipped* on 12/23/2025.  This means that the first batch would arrive on the 24th, and the majority remaining would arrive on the 26th and 27th, followed by stragglers.  Personally, I received *my* boxes on the Friday, the 26th of December.\n\n**Where are the Golden Hour Parallels?**\n\nI know many people have differing opinions on breaking, however a huge positive to come out of it is that people are putting things on video way more often.  Videos (and even more so live streams) are the best evidence.    \n  \nMy trading card friends and myself, as we usually do, started watching for Black and White rips/breaks to appear.  What we found, which became obvious after each and every rip, was that Golden Hour parallels were not included in the product.  Evidence was gathered and documented.  Here is a summary breakdown:\n\n*Pre-Order Box Data*\n\n* 106 Collector Box rips from 15 Whatnot streamers\n* 56 Collector Box rips from 27 Youtube videos\n* 10 personal Collector Box rips\n* 92 Collector Box rips from friends and discord servers\n\nThat is a total of **264 boxes**.  \nIn that documented total, **0** Golden Hour parallels were pulled.  \nIn case you are wondering, the odds of going through 264 boxes and not pulling a card that is \\~1:7.035 boxes is **1 in 379 quadrillion**.   \nFor those with common sense, and I expect all that are reading have it, that means impossible.  \nThe Golden Hour parallels were missing from the product in the Pre-Order Boxes.\n\n**Wait a minute… Online Exclusive Release Day Boxes?**\n\nSo, after the initial delay of Black and White, they announced that they would be selling more.  This did not make too much sense, because in the past, with Online Exclusives, there has generally just been one “order date” and then eventual shipment.    \n  \nAt the time of the “street date,” and thus the “release day,” Topps had already removed the ability for everyone to see stocked inventory.  Therefore, we do not know how many of the (maximum) 2,217 Collector Boxes went for sale on the 23rd.\n\nThe boxes that went for sale on the 23rd of December, 2025 will be known as “Release Day Boxes.”    \n  \nFrom the evidence collected, it appears these boxes were picked up on the 30th of December, 2025, which means they started hitting Florida shortly afterward (minus the January 1st, 2026 holiday halting/delaying operations).\n\nThat's when this ordeal took a turn.  After a whole week of Pre-Order box breaks and rips, the following post appeared on X:\n\n[The first Golden Hour appears in a Release Day Box](https://preview.redd.it/koqn2ek5xccg1.jpg?width=501&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aef0ff5d58126fae918b60b9152a0febea6ebbaf)\n\n\n\n[The user confirms they are Release Day Boxes and that he received them quickly \\(due to proximity to Rex3\\)](https://preview.redd.it/vc8kjk7dxccg1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51f39f34c42a2a924bf93132a5269623fa6eeaf7)\n\nWith the Golden Hours missing, there were basically 2 theories:\n\n1. They completely neglected putting the Golden Hour parallels in the product.\n2. They ended up accidentally placing the Golden Hour parallels in the wrong SKU (Mega Boxes)\n\nThose were both incorrect, and it appears that they could have stuffed all the missing Golden Hour parallels into the remaining Collector's Boxes (and thus, the \"Release Day Boxes\").  \n  \n**The Golden Hour Begins - Exclusive to Release Day Boxes**\n\nAs Release Day Boxes start rolling into households, Golden Hour parallels start making their way onto social media and Ebay (after a week of not one listing).  We predicted that since there were at most 2,217 Collector's Boxes left, since they put them in the Release Day Boxes, we were going to see Golden Hours hit at a rate of 1 out of every 2 boxes.  This is because they need to distribute the 1,000 Golden Hour parallels to the remaining pool of boxes.  Boy, did we overestimate that.\n\nThe following are some examples of Release Day Boxes that were documented:\n\n[The above 5 Golden Hours came from 5 Release Day Boxes](https://preview.redd.it/gxdd1p41zccg1.jpg?width=689&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22726bf19fa71e305ec5be84e85f22d59a6429ca)\n\n\n\n[eBay user kopanda22 seemed to get really lucky with his hit rate on confirmed Release Day Boxes](https://preview.redd.it/syo3hwebzccg1.jpg?width=891&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=152a1fec4c4dbb2d228112404415475a61d6c2f6)\n\n(Ebay sales are public record, and you are welcome to go look for yourself.  There are several users with an average of 4+ golden hours listed/sold.  It’s actually quite impressive).\n\nJust two nights ago, the whatnot user *jklsouled* conducted 2 breaks.  In the first break of 5 boxes, he clarified that they were pre-order boxes.  Then he conducted a second break in which he disclosed that they were Release Day Boxes.  Take a look at the results of the second break (4 boxes):\n\n[Release Day Box 1 Golden Hour](https://preview.redd.it/olruxlzw0dcg1.jpg?width=682&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d36641ed00f032a2ea678cbe4fc8de252fd4da86)\n\n\n\n[Release Day Box 2 Golden Hour](https://preview.redd.it/vmkwdpb01dcg1.jpg?width=625&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46754aa7b916ecf1fe61feced42e590d4e73332d)\n\n\n\n[Release Day Box 3 Golden Hour](https://preview.redd.it/dszab4611dcg1.jpg?width=784&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ff6fbf5999615389658f6e9a8f24a0aa5de0215)\n\n\n\n[Release Day Box 4 Golden Hour](https://preview.redd.it/xziysr821dcg1.jpg?width=742&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdd30b5a6ec945071c497f46bd0b2df6467a76ec)\n\nThat's right.  That is 4 more Golden Hour parallels out of 4 Release Day Boxes.\n\nNext, a few discord members were lucky enough to have received Release Day Boxes, because, well they knew what was coming.  These are a sample:\n\n[Release Day Box #1 User 1](https://preview.redd.it/m1zomukw3dcg1.png?width=271&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce9596324ac2bfecfb687963b6606517bb46fd2)\n\n\n\n[Release Day Box #2 User 1](https://preview.redd.it/n2venwn14dcg1.png?width=487&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c402dcb6433a95bc6d88b092a0c541715c2016a)\n\n\n\n[Release Day Box #3 User 1](https://preview.redd.it/7ghtqr1c4dcg1.png?width=337&format=png&auto=webp&s=2dd89f040d1b539a9a55b45d79c840aa3c309bf8)\n\n\n\n[User 2 Release Day Box](https://preview.redd.it/b3kcgc9f4dcg1.png?width=547&format=png&auto=webp&s=c58b5a724ad50e606f8691336dccdd5798e61207)\n\n\n\n[User 3 Release Day Box - I am sure you are seeing a trend with another type of card](https://preview.redd.it/qnrjv4vr4dcg1.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8a37391acced2b4a923107a9539ba7d488ae4ef)\n\n\n\nSo, the Golden Hour hit rate is not 1:2 in Release Day Boxes.  So far, out of approximately 24 Release Day Boxes logged, only 2 did NOT have Golden Hour parallels.  \nThis means that Golden Hour parallels are coming out of Release Day Boxes at an almost **1 per 1.1** box rate.\n\nI am sure everyone noticed the ink signatures as well.  Up to this point in time, I have seen 5 ink signatures (of the 60) all hit in Release Day Boxes.  It's very likely that they received the same treatment as the Golden Hours.  It can't confidently be concluded, however, as we are talking about 60 (ink signature) cards vs. 1000 (Golden Hour) cards.\n\n**Everyone Knows**\n\n[eBay users are making sure buyers know what their boxes do and do not contain](https://preview.redd.it/g6bw06vp5dcg1.jpg?width=617&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d8d4c2b9a0f130d9cf29e7bbc67f378293500af)\n\n  \nEveryone knows.  Every break that I have seen, users are asking if the boxes are Release Day or Pre-Order boxes.  Above are some of the ebay listings that include disclosure in the title (there are more with disclosures in their description).  People are sending messages to sellers asking if they are Release Day Boxes.  Breakers are making sure they are telling their customers whether they are Pre-Order boxes or not.  Everyone seems to know...\n\n...except Topps?\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTopps Black and White is one of the most anticipated releases for collectors such as myself.  What Topps did is **not** OK.  Whether it was a mistake or intentional (I am giving them the benefit of the doubt that it was a mistake), we as a card community **cannot** stand for something this egregious to be swept under the rug.    \n  \nIf you ordered a pre-order box, there was **0%** chance that you would pull the Golden Hour parallel, despite Topps telling you it was in the boxes.  This was further exacerbated by the fact that they stuffed them in the limited Release Day Boxes.\n\nTopps/Fanatics **must** be held accountable for this.  It was beneficial that we as a community caught this, but we have to **pursue** it.  Personally, I am looking for them to at least *acknowledge* it.  I don’t know how they can actually *fix* the issue, but if we let them ignore it, then we are telling them that we are OK with this happening.\n\nWe need answers.",

    "text": "First off, what an incredible first viewing.\n\nWhen Marty meets his son at the end of the movie, you can see just the last name \"Mizler\" in the crib. No first name. We can assume that Marty wants the baby to take his last name, as his ego would not accept any less. This is where my theory comes into play. The baby is named Howard Mauser and grows up to be none other than the Howard Ratner we came to know and love in Uncut Gems. Thus the Safdie-verse is created.\n\nMy assumption is that Marty either was not around for Howard's upbringing or was in and out of his life because he could never have anything but ping pong truly be the center of his attention. After years of heartache, as soon as he could, Howard changed his last name to distance himself from his father.\n\nHoward heard three constant tales growing up:\n\n1. Marty brought back a literal piece of the pyramids that his ancestors built for his mother.\n2. How his father tried to pawn off costume jewelry to fund his trip to Japan and was seen right through immediately\n3. Marty viewed ping pong to be a superior sport to others and how he felt humiliated being the halftime show for basketball of all sports.\n\nHoward decides to make it his life mission to one up his father and do all of those things bigger and better. This is why he becomes a successful jewelry dealer who actually gets away with selling fake watches for legitimate prices. A dig at his dad for the costume jewelry. Howard also made it a life mission being obsessed with obtaining an Ethiopian Opal that is connected to his Jewish ancestors/heritage and selling it for a million dollars at auction to make the piece of pyramid his father brought back home be literally worthless. When Kevin Garnett enters his shop, this is Marty's chance to connect himself to basketball greatness as he has always admired the sport that his father despised. Why else would he be so loose with letting KG borrow the opal? He wants to stick it to his dad by helping out a star basketball player and help him excel.\n\nBut, as much as Howard tries to distance himself from his father- he is truly his father's son. There are so many similarities between the two. Whether it be paying off debts/funding his ventures with money and possessions that aren't his own, womanizing, etc. Howard is Marty.\n\nThank you all for reading and I hope these thoughts connected with you as much as they did in my delusional brain.",

    "text": "Forgive me if it sounds like a big ol ramble lol; I should be asleep but this topic is so intriguing, I just have to see if anyone else knows about it and what not so I’m basically just spewing whatever I know about this topic + some theories to see if a conversation can get going\n\nLike Alice, I legitimately went down a rabbit hole regarding this topic; what I found is that this topic is some of the most understudied in terms of Disney lost media, which is incredibly surprising considering it’s connected to one of the most well known works of the company. I must shout out raretendo6879 on YouTube for making the most thorough compilation of Alice in Wonderland lost media I’ve seen. Here’s the video in question: https://youtu.be/fhyepuS4hhA?si=U1NkR_6Q57jqIXan\n\nSo for reference, I originally posted on a different subreddit; I was inquiring about an animation cel that caught my eye while browsing Ebay: https://ebay.us/m/aCi5Ru\n\nThis thing looked so darn weird, I had to know more about it; I looooove Alice in Wonderland but I’ve never seen anything like this before. I looked at the listing, which stated: \n“This animation cell is from Disney's 1980 film :\n Alice in Wonderland \"For dinner or for dinner\"\n\nFurthermore, it elaborated on the Jabberwocky character seen with Alice in the cel:\n“The Jabberwock dragon was a villain character which was deleted from the original\n 1951 Disney film \"Alice in Wonderland\". Film producers decided in late production that the character Jabberwock was too scary for the films intended audience and the scene too violent.\nOnly one original cel from that deleted 1951 scene has ever been brought to market, selling in 2012 for over $15k by Heritage auctions.”\n\nI was stoked because, quite frankly, as a fan of both the books and the movie, I always wanted to see a Disney Golden Age Era version of the dragon- I felt it was sorely missed in the movie; finding out that at the end, they actually DID end up doing something with him made me excited to see the films he was featured in\n\nHowever, there was a problem; I scoured the internet and couldn’t find this “For Dinner or For Dinner” film that was mentioned in the listing. I made my post, was directed to raretendo’s video about the topic, and realized that this cel actually came from a piece of lost Disney media. I was stunned because honestly, I’m not new to Disney lost media whatsoever and thought I was familiar with a good chunk of it considering how well the company documents its projects; furthermore, considering it was from one of the company’s most iconic films, I thought that this would have been a more well known topic. However, what I found is that this topic has been seemingly forgotten to time; nevertheless, as I saw in the comments of the aforementioned video, there absolutely are people who remember seeing this film; this confirms that not only were these cels made, but the project it was for came to fruition and was actually shown to people, namely children in schools as  most of the lost media discussed here ended up being part of a Disney sponsored educational campaign for schools.\n\nUsing the video as a guide, I looked into other cels connected to the film or the Jabberwocky in general; like I stated earlier in the post, there was actually a cel sold on Heritage Auctions featuring the Jabberwocky and Alice waaaaaaaay back in 2012. Comparing this cel with the one on Ebay made me POTENTIALLY realize something: these cels, though legitimately from Disney, look like they’re from two different projects. This is somewhat confirmed based on my research but at this point in the post, I want to make something abundantly clear: I will try my best to give as accurate information as I can- however, I am going to delve into speculation at this point forward. TAKE WHAT I SAY WITH A GRAIN OF SALT; this is such an obscure topic that there is naturally more than ample room for error. \n\nThat said, I want to bring your attention to these cels:\n\nhttps://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/1980-alice-wonderland-dinner-dinner-4892557005\n\nhttps://www.ebay.com/itm/167768715165\n\n\nhttps://www.ebay.com/itm/167793163305\n\nhttps://comics.ha.com/itm/animation-art/production-cel/alice-in-communication-land-alice-production-cel-and-key-master-background-walt-disney-1976-/a/7235-99711.s\n\nhttps://wonderland.fandom.com/wiki/Jabberwocky_(1951)\n(For this one, pay attention to the Jabberwocky pic on the wiki)\n\nAccording to raretendo’s video, amongst the lost media of the franchise, there are two lost films I’d like to point out: “For dinner or for dinner” and “Alice in communication land”. Once again these are both films suspected to have been shown to schools, as evidenced by a magazine clipping in the video giving teachers directions for class activities to do after showing the film and as evidenced by people’s recollection of the films themselves. “Alice in communication land”, released on 1976(?), seemed to have had animated, “PowerPoint-esque”, and hybrid segments and was focused on the topic of teaching children how to exercise clarity in their speech; “For dinner or For dinner”, released on 1980, was recollected to be very “PowerPoint-esque” in that it was a collection of pictures with overlying narration; the topic was similar to the 1976 film in that it was primarily about clarity of speech. There are different accounts about what the actual plot was of these films so I’m not going to get into that as they kind of melt into one another for reasons I will touch on later here. However, one thing to note is that there is tentative confirmation that the Jabberwocky appeared separately in both films; on the folder seen in the eBay listing in the third link I sent in the list above, you can see the words “Twas Brillig”. In the original Ebay listing that sparked this search for me, the one with the goofier version of the dragon, the folder featured the title “For Dinner or For Dinner”. The source of the later is self explanatory but what about the former? For that, I bring your attention to yet another cel:\n\nhttps://www.ebay.com/itm/375924700558\n\nSupposedly, this is a cel from “Alice in Communication land”; interestingly, if you draw your attention to the top left corner, you can see “‘Twas Brillig” written upside down (apparently this Cheshire Cat scene was supposed to be upside down). Additionally, if you compare the 4th cel in the aforementioned list, which is a Communication land cel, and the actual picture of the Jabberwocky as seen in the Wiki I posted, you can see that the same exact background art is used for both cels (which begs the question, where is THAT Jabberwocky cel? I personally haven’t found it sold yet- it appears in the wiki and that’s it). So there’s a possibility that the “scarier”Jabberwocky was used in “Communication land” and that the goofier one was used in “For dinner or for dinner”; this would explain the difference in color values as the “Communication land” one looked more cinematic for lack of a better word, which in part leads me to believe that the one sold in 2012 was also from “Communication land” as both the backgrounds and the colors match.\n\nI then began delving more into the history of “Communication land” as that seemed to have more substance in terms of featuring the elusive Jabberwocky than “For Dinner or For Dinner”. As I compared the non-Jabberwocky cels of this project, I noticed something.\n\nFor reference, I’ve watched Alice in Wonderland an absurd amount of times, so I caught on quickly to the fact that they traced a good chunk of the frames from the original movie; they did this as well in “For Dinner or For Dinner” but for whatever reason, I felt that “Communication-land” had a glaring amount of reused frames. Again, most were copied but I suspect that some were repurposed “rejected” frames from the original movie; in a sequence supposedly featured in the lost film, there is a nearly identical recreation (in terms of cels) of the walrus and the carpenter:\n\nhttps://www.artnet.com/artists/walt-disney-studios/alice-in-communication-land-playing-walrus-and-REwOGbGvVyEPRWZmOVd6Qg2\n\nHowever, in the original film, despite the frames looking nearly identical, the walrus doesn’t open his mouth and the carpenter doesn’t smile but, rather, grimaces; by that metric, we can make the conclusion that these frames were traced but I feel like there’s something worth to note before automatically doing that. If you slow down the sequence in the original movie and pay attention to the carpenter’s fingers as he’s taking off his shoe, you can note that, interestingly, his fingers phase in and out; at the exact frame in the original film that is being compared with the “Communication land” version, he has his fingers. However! In the “Communication land” version, he doesn’t have his fingers, which makes me beg the question as to whether or not that is, in fact, a repurposed frame from the original movie that was taken out in favor of the aforementioned “grimacing” frame.\n\nSeveral other things to note before making my final point: \n\n*Correct me if I’m wrong, but I have never seen another Disney property be subject of reused frames as much as Alice in Wonderland; I know especially in the 70s they’d reuse animation but it wasn’t, like, straight up tracing (or perhaps reusing) the frame- even in their other educational shorts, I haven’t really seen that. Again, I could be horrifically wrong lol\n\n*The song for the Jabberwocky actually was made for the film! https://youtu.be/y_gyHtI4hwA?si=wvnzejS_ImP1Vhts\nIt was cut from the film around 1947, around 3 years prior to the original movie but yeah, they even had a voice actor planned for the character: Stan Freberg! They had every intention to include the character; a storyboard of the Jabberwocky scene (as seen on the wiki), and multiple concept art was made and everything, albeit with wildly different designs\n\n* There was a lot of back and forth regarding the design; a lot of goofy/experimental concept art of the creature was made and a piece of Jabberwocky concept art is known to have been reused, namely in the official Disney Jabberwocky poem (also seen in the wiki). Again, super different design. Additionally, there was a lot of back and forth regarding whether or not to make the Jabberwocky menacing, silly, or both. One thing that was consistently mentioned during the research was the fact that the Jabberwocky was supposed to be threatening and chasing Alice all throughout Tugley wood after she left the Mad Hatter/March Hare tea party in the original film.\n\n* This is incredibly subjective but I can’t help but notice the wildly differing quality of cels connected to “Communication land”; Alice, the walrus, and the carpenter are sometimes so off model, which is expected from a lower budget educational film, even if it is from Disney. In contrast, from what I can find in terms of the Jabberwocky cels in “Communication land”, they are consistently “cinematic” imo- down to the color choice; I can’t help but to feel as if I’m looking at a frame of the original movie when I look at them.\n\nSo with alllllll of this information, two overall questions remain on my end:\n* Where are those lost films?\n* Most intriguingly imo, are the “Communication land” Jabberwocky cels repurposed cels from the original 1951 movie? Is this the actual deleted/cut scene repurposed for another project?\n\nLet me know what yall think and most importantly, if you guys know something that wasn’t mentioned or wish to clarify something that was said, please comment! I’m not an expert in things like this! I consume a lot of content about lost media but I am in no way an expert!!!! However, I just wanted to bring this topic to yall because honestly I feel like it’s grossly overlooked despite being incredibly interesting \n\n\n\n",

    "text": "What is a (Google) Pixel these days? What is its purpose in the mobile (not just phone) marketplace and product landscape? Is it just a super simple and accessible device with a showcase of Google's latest AI… and that’s it? \n\n*I want to strike up a bit of a discussion here with my rant.*\n\nI’ve been a loyal user for years (currently rocking the Pixel 10 Pro, before that I was on the 7, also using the Watch 3 and Buds Pro, and many other Nest devices and all Google Workspace software), but I am not a Google fanatic, I also own an iPhone for work, had an Apple watch for a while and own a OnePlus Pad 2 (no way in hell would I use the Pixel Tablet, lol), I used Xiaomis before moving to Google (first stock, then with pixel-like custom rom) and still like and recommend their budget devices for the price. My family mostly uses Samsungs, and as my job is software development, I am the family \"technician\", so I’m familiar with all their quirks and features.\n\nI kinda loved what the Pixel represented (clean native software, fast and useful updates, great cameras) when I first looked into it deeper in around 2019 (soli radar ftw), I still love the idea itself, but to be honest, I feel like we are stuck in a loop while the competition is lapping us. I want to love this \"ecosystem\", but currently it feels like a collection of great features rather than a cohesive product. Honestly, the only reasons I have not switched to Apple is my excitement for Android XR glasses and my curiosity for Android Desktop. These 2 new products **can** be true game changers, but a solid foundation is still missing. Let me elaborate, I’ll focus on 3 main parts which are bugging me:\n\n**1. Pixel phones**, **now not much more than a showroom for Gemini**\n\nI’ll start with the **cameras**, as this was the main reason I always wanted a Pixel. We have remnants of what were once excellent cameras. In almost 2026 however, ‘computational photography’ isn't enough, especially when the person responsible behind the magic has been long gone.. Google wants to save costs (this will be a recurring theme in this post), so they don’t use the latest and greatest sensors like the Chinese brands. And that’s okay, we could partially solve it by good software features *(by the way, we now have had the main GN1/GNV sensor for the same time as the Sony sensor from P1\\* to P5 before)*. \n\nWhat’s not okay for me is that I bought the \"Pro\" phone - where are the actual Pro features for creators? Apple users have had Apple Log, ProRes, and an ecosystem of 3rd party tools (like Halide) for years. On Pixel, we still can't properly record in a flat Log profile natively (or even in a semi simple way in a 3rd party camera app, although… bless MotionCam). If this is a ‘Pro’ phone, let me deal with the raw Video Boost footage like a professional myself! No 4K HDR at 60 fps? I won’t even start, because there is nothing to be said about this. A damn shame. \n\nBut that’s all okay now, because Pixel is the king of **AI**, right? Google saves a lot of money by using Tensor instead of Snapdragon. By buying Pixel we choose not to have the best raw performance (I don’t play intensive mobile games), but where is our actual AI advantage? By artificially locking down Google apps features to the *newest* Pixel? In the on-device AI, even iPhones are beating us in on-device inference now, and their FMF seems to be taken more seriously than Gemini Nano adjacent features… Gemini (the app) is everywhere now so that is not any advantage for Pixels. Magic Cue is almost as disappointing as Apple Intelligence, other Androids or unsupported Pixels can get many of the other Google AI features working by installing an apk (remember when Google limited Magic Eraser, a **cloud** feature at that time, to the newest Pixel?). The voice recognition baked into Gboard and Recorder is excellent, but these features lose 80% of their utility the moment you step outside the english language. If Google wants to be the ‘AI for everyone’ company, they need to stop region-locking the intelligence that is supposed to be the selling point of the device. Especially, when Google almost certainly lost the phone \"war\" in the US. Because I am in the EU and have **no** pixel calling features and had to sideload magic cue, screenshots, studio and probably more apps in the future, what is my incentive to get a Pixel?\n\n**2. (Dis)connected ecosystem**\n\nI love my Pixel watch. I like Fitbit. I hate the way it is integrated with the rest of my ecosystem. You have owned Fitbit for years now. Stop treating it like a third-party accessory and **make every Pixel a Fitbit.** Google Clock, Modes (including bedtime) and Digital wellbeing should work well with Fitbit, not force me to have duplicate bedtime and wake up settings and so on. And why do I have to hunt on the Play Store for a decent Compass app or a Noise Meter? These are safety/health features that should be pre-installed and calibrated by the manufacturer. All equivalent Apple devices are \"Apple Health\" devices. I want my Pixel Buds to feed the hearing protection data (decibel exposure) directly into my health metrics. I want \"Walking Steadiness\" analysis using the phone's accelerometer (fall prevention). Nest Hubs are still pushing sleep data into Google Fit in (almost) 2026! Wtf? \n\nWhere is the \"Google/Android Shortcuts\" app? It is (almost) 2026. Why do I still need Tasker to automate my life? MacroDroid is also great, but my point is that this kind of feature needs to work on the system level. Gemini also wants to make my life simpler, but I don’t need a LLM for everything! Apple Shortcuts is the gold standard, powerful, deeply integrated into the OS, and accessible to normal people. Samsung Routines are also great. Pixels want to be accessible, right? The \"Routines\" in the Google Home app are a joke compared to the granular control iOS users have had for half a decade. Why can't I build simple automations that trigger across my watch, phone, and home?  A Google dev intern can make this happen in a day or two. The system APIs are there already, we just need to be able to access them. Slap on some M3E components, connect it to Google apps, and give 3rd party devs an API, that’s it. \n\nAnd to finish off this section: Google talks a big game about the \"Better Together\" ecosystem, but they miss the simplest QoL features. On my Pixel phone, I can see the battery of my Watch and Buds. Great. But why can't I see my phone's battery level on my Watch? Why can't I see my tablet's battery on my phone? Apple and Samsung figured this out ages ago. Can’t you just bake it into the Play services? Digital wellbeing again, why can’t I share screen time data between my devices? There are many other little things like this that would make the ecosystem so much better to use. These don’t add any cost to hardware, just a couple of work mandays to Google developers. But instead they focus on developing their apps on iOS first, Android second.\n\n**3. Consistency and QA**\n\nGoogle Support. That’s it. I won’t even go further into this topic, because the many posts you can find on this subreddit do it for me. Again, this is a shameful example of cost cutting, no going around it. The problem is that every Pixel seems to have its quirks (swelling batteries, green lines on display, camera modules ungluing, watch backs falling off, buds ANC issues) so chances are that you might need their support. Good luck to me when the Pixel 10 series’ issue comes out, hopefully not the camera module like last year’s model.\n\nWe, Pixel users are often beta testers of further ecosystem features. That’s okay by me. But what in the planned obsolescence has Google been doing these past recent years? Locking down basic apps like Screenshots or Journal, recently releasing a feature update for the new Pixel watch which added one hand gestures. Why did these not come to my barely over a year old watch? It has basically the same chip as the newest watch 4.\n\nGoogle **can** do many good things, M3E is a clear example. Some people might not like the design language itself, but the important thing is that Google went their own way instead of just following others, like the chinese brands often do. Google also keeps implementing technical standards faster than others these days, BT 6, WiFi 7, Thread, Qi2(!). That’s great progress. Repairability has also improved a lot from just a couple of years ago.\n\nI don't want to switch to an iPhone. But Google, if you want to copy something from it, do not copy the restrictions, copy the *cohesion*. You have the ecosystem to do so, and if Pixel is the reference Android, its experience should be the reference Android experience. Stop with just showing off (admittedly cool) AI demos and give us a platform that actually talks to itself. Or…  perhaps I should just accept that Google does not really care all that much about these things, and move on.\n\n**TL;DR: Quo vadis Google Pixel? And what do you people think Google should do to make a Pixel the desired device, if we cut off the AI marketing jargon?**  \n\n*Disclaimer before some people come for me in the comments: This text was proofread and translated with Gemini, as english is not my native language. No, the AI did not construct the content or the bullet-pointy structure, that was fully me.*",

We’ve seen some truly absurd cases (looking at you u/blezsportscards).\n\n  \nThat got me wondering whether the numbers themselves could help validate or challenge that perception across both hobby and retail SKUs.\n\n  \n**How I approached this:**\n\n  \nInstead of focusing on per-box averages, I asked a different question:  \n How many boxes of each format does it take to pull a “rare hit”?\n\nI looked at two buckets:\n\n  \n1) **Low-numbered parallels (≤50 copies)**  \nThis includes Gold, Orange, Black, Red, Super, and Frozenfractor parallels, along with those same parallels of Basketballs, Pulsars, Raywaves, and Geometrics. I also included Image Variation and Auto parallels numbered /50 or less.\n\n  \nI understand there are meaningful hits numbered higher than 50 (ex: Flagg Blue Auto /150, Flagg Green Image Variation /99), but those apply to only a handful of players and don’t materially change format-level dynamics.\n\n  \n2) **Case Hit or tougher inserts**  \nThese include Rock Stars, Let’s Go!, Ultra Violet, Radiating Rookies, Helix, Lightboard Logos, Hidden Gems, Advisory, Glass Canvas, Paradox, Patented, Fanatical, Finals, and Gold Logomen.\n\n  \nUsing published odds, I can calculate the frequencies of low-numbered parallels and Case Hits without much trouble. What I cannot account for is name distribution. Odds don’t tell us which players land in which formats. If 90% of Gold Cooper Flagg autos are seeded into Jumbos, I can't help you there. The only way to know that is by watching rips.\n\n  \n**Quick side note:**  \nSome base Geometric insert and auto parallels are insanely rare. If the published odds are accurate (which I assume is the case because they are consistent), base Geometric parallels of common inserts are limited to roughly 2–3 copies each. Very few people will actually realize this, so their relative value will almost certainly be amiss.\n\nBase Geometric autos are similarly scarce. They’re limited to about 20–25 copies each and are far tougher to pull than their Purple or Gold counterparts.\n\n  \n**What this exercise is actually trying to answer:**\n\n  \n1) Relative pricing, not secondary wax insanity.  \nNot “are current wax prices justified?,” but rather:  \nIs Breaker’s priced at 3× Hobby because you’re \\~3× more likely to land a rare hit?  \n2) What about retail? Are Hangers truly “bangers\" when it comes to rare hits as well? Or does it just feel that way due to volume?\n\n3) Which formats offer the best rare hit potential, including hobby and retail?  \n4) Are Breaker’s Delight boxes really as loaded as they seem?  \n5) Is there any realistic value to be squeezed from $50 blasters or $85 megas? Spoiler: maybe. But your wallet may disagree. \n\n  \n**Enhanced Hit Frequencies**\n\nSee my original breakdown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseballcards/comments/1nzvw3y/202526_topps_basketball_breakdown_and_deep_dive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) to see a complete list of hit frequencies by format.\n\n  \n**How many Hobby boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 3.85 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 9.78 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 2.76 boxes (4.35/case)  \n2.76 boxes × $625/box (Blowout) = $1,725 per rare hit\n\n  \n**How many Jumbo boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 1.93 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 5.74 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 1.45 boxes (5.52/case)  \n1.45 boxes × $1,815 (D&A) = $2,631.75 per rare hit\n\n  \n**How many Breaker’s Delight boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 0.74 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 10.7 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 0.69 boxes (8.7/case)  \n0.69 boxes × $2,500 (D&A) = $1,725 per rare hit  \n0.69 boxes × $2,150 (eBay) = $1,483.50 per rare hit\n\n  \n**How many Value boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 26.31 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 13.27 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 8.82 boxes (4.54/case)  \n8.82 boxes × $50 = $441 per rare hit\n\n  \n**How many Hanger boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 15.53 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 21.05 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 8.94 boxes (7.16/case)  \n8.94 boxes × $20 = $178.80 per rare hit\n\n  \n**How many Mega boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 14.92 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 6.62 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 4.59 boxes  \n4.59 boxes × $85 = $390.15 per rare hit\n\n  \n**How many Fanatics Mega boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 15.42 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 4.97 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 3.76 boxes (4.36/case)  \n3.76 boxes × $100 = $376 per rare hit\n\n  \n**Takeaways**\n\n  \n1) **Breaker’s Delight really is different.**  \nA \"Rare Hit\" can be expected in slightly more than 2 out of 3 Breaker's boxes. Assuming names are somewhat evenly dispersed, it’s about 4× more likely to pull a big hit from Breaker’s Delight than from Hobby, and more than 2× more likely than from Jumbo. Based on Big Hit potential alone, Jumbo should cost about twice as much as hobby, and Breaker's should cost about 4× Hobby (meaning Breaker's should also cost twice as much as Jumbo).\n\nIn short- avoid Jumbo boxes. \n\n  \nIt's easy to see why Breaker’s has surpassed Jumbo in price by a decent margin. When Breaker’s was under $2,000, it was unquestionably the best hobby SKU for landing big hits. It took pricing reaching $2,500 at DA Card World to roughly equal Hobby in “$ per rare hit.”\n\nThere are still boxes on eBay around $2,150 if you feel compelled to go that route, which sounds absolutely ludicrous. But I am not here to judge financial decisions. I am merely here to spreadsheet them. Also consider a base Flagg auto is holding near $2,000, and it's not uncommon to see multiple big hits from a single Breaker’s box.\n\n  \n2) **Retail is hiding more value than most people realize.**  \nEvery retail format beats every hobby format in $ per rare hit- and it's not even close. **You absolutely do not need to pay hobby prices to hit big cards in this product.**\n\nHangers continue to prove they’re bangers, boasting the best ratio of all formats at $179 per rare hit. While not scarce (500k+ produced), there are still 20% more Megas than Hangers, and over twice as many Value boxes. It's just as easy to pull a rare hit from a Hanger as it is from a Value box, which is significant considering they are $20 vs $50 for Values. \n\n**The wildest stat in this entire breakdown: an average case of Hangers delivers just one fewer rare hit than an average case of Breaker’s Delight... at only 6.4% of the cost.**\n\nHangers are still available direct from Fanatics and Topps. Once they’re gone, there’s precisely zero chance they remain at $20. At current pricing, they are the cheapest path to hitting everything that isn’t hobby exclusive. Full transparency.... I'm hoarding them. \n\n  \n3) **Fanatics Megas excel at Case Hits.**  \nIf nothing else, Fanatics Megas provide the most efficient route to Case Hit or tougher inserts, landing at roughly 1 in every 5 boxes.\n\n  \n4) I received some pushback on my original write-up for calling this a masterfully crafted product, but I still stand by that assessment. How else does a Chrome release with roughly 90 million cards manage to feel this consistently loaded? It’s the largest Chrome product ever produced, yet it also commands the highest per-box pricing we've ever seen from a Chrome release. u/Topps got a lot of things right with this release, regardless of how homerish I may sound.

    "text": "I’m a 51 year old dude who’s been building something since before I was 16, trucks, bikes, cars, tow trucks, big rigs…. Mustangs, Camaro’s, malibus, rx-7’s, Escalades, trans ams, novas, k5’s….. none of them stock. As I get older they get better but never stock. When I go to cruise night I love them all, full customs to perfectly restored/maintained stock classics. \nI am not a nova fanatic but I love my nova, I wasn’t looking for a nova and I for sure not looking for a 74. A guy I knew had it in a storage yard and 500 bought a pretty solid shell, and when I say shell it was a roller with 295 -14” slots on the back and 235’s in the front with some awesome shackles and air shocks with the back of the wheel wells properly blasted from endless burnouts. The interior, wiring harness was completely gone, no brake booster, the dash was basically gone and all kicked in, but it was a solid body. \nI had zero intentions on keeping the front end or rear bumper, taillights, yes but with the center filled in. \nI put global west arms, hotchkis sway bars, Viking coilovers, afx spindles with c5 corvette brakes front and rear (15” cragars are a no go with 13” rotors, but you stop awesome), the kicked in dash was replaced with a 67 Camaro dash with modern gauges,2015 Camaro seats, a truck LS and a ctsv t-56. I bought very little nova parts except body restoration stuff. \nWhenever I post it I get the “should have bought a 70 if you wanted a 70” I’d cut a 70 up too. \n“I hate the wheels” I love to stop. \n“Nice lowrider” it’s a performance car, not a lowrider. “A LS is played out and ugly” on my road trip from Phoenix to South Dakota and back it was flawless at every elevation, never overheated and get us there and back with no issues.  \nI’m no spring chicken, I built the car you love in 1988, I left that style and that tech back there, I’ve had a set of traction bars off my nova on marketplace on and off for years, nobody ever asks about them. My car is everything I want (almost) and handles and breaks fantastic, like a modern car plus power everything, keyless start, keyless doors, automated lighting, all led lighting and an electrical system that can handle all that. Besides not being painted and incomplete interior it’s a pretty cool car. \nThis is HOT RODDING!!!! I didn’t dream of having a perfectly stock car, I played with hotwheels, watched the fall guy, knight rider, the duke boys, watched the cartoon M.A.S.K with an irok with gull doors that could fly and a Peterbilt with stack cannons. \nIf bringing them back to factory perfection is your thing that’s great, I’m always amazed at a pristine restoration and will spend more time looking at them than full customs sometimes. I love the focus and attention to detail these guys put into every inch of the car, it takes a certain type of person and I commend them for their effort and skill. I promise you it takes the same effort to design everything that goes into a build like this and everything work together well. \nWhen I see someone post a pristine nova sitting kind of high, cowl hood, cragar ss/t’s with 275’s in the back and 235’s in the front I love it and brings me back to the fun days of my youth, my ADD doesn’t allow that in my garage, that’s not the car I want. I would instantly tear the suspension and drivetrain out, sell it all on Marketplace and start collecting parts. Doesn’t mean I don’t love it the way it is or EVER criticize the owner for HIS choices on HIS car. \nIn the entire car scene the only thing I’ll criticize is the stance guys with tons of negative camber who can’t drive down the road without something falling off or Carolina squats. If your mods make it worse or unsafe my ADD Can’t take it. I run a custom suspension shop and if I can’t get good alignment numbers I won’t build it. \nI can understand appreciate the purists and we need them in the community to keep the unicorns alive. Not appreciating an old car built for today’s performance? That’s so anti HOT RODDING to me. It’s just boring. I took a shell sitting around since 1989 in a desert lot and made it something cool before it went to scrap or someone’s driveway that “will fix it up one day”\nSorry for my rant, it drives me crazy. It’s like when you bring a fully custom off road jeep to a Jeep meet and everyone has a chubby for the mall crawler with rhino lined inner tub. \n",

STOP PAYING THE INSANE PRICES THAT FANATICS IS SELLING FOR. \n\nIf you all keep buying; they’ll keep raising prices higher and higher; with no end in sight. \n\nSAVE THE HOBBY. STOP BUYING TOPPS/FANATICS. \n\nAnd before all you “it’s free market economics blah blah blah” people chime in… no. It’s not. \n\nThe Hobby has become a casino. It’s gone from an industry who sold to fathers and sons; to one that uses every trick in the book to make you believe you’re one pack away from life changing money. The lights. The noise. The breaker screaming at the top of their lungs. The bullshit “that spot is paid” (when it’s def not). It’s all a psy-op to get you more addicted to the point you can’t stop. \n\nThe one and ONLY thing that will combat this; is to stop buying. Period. ",

With the recent events with Filth Bomb Breaks and their astronomically disproportionate amount of Debut Patches pulled, I think we can all tell what direction Topps is taking the hobby. If you aren’t a big Fanatics Live breaker sucking up to Topps, you’re screwed. This goes for customers as well, if you don’t break with Fanatics, you’re screwed.

    "text": "When I saw Ricks Sheriff Hat was offered on Heritage Auctions in October of 2025, I was interested to bid on it but somethings made me feel skeptical about it.\n\nFor example, in the Heritage Auctions listing for the sheriff's hat with the badge, the badge looks way too big for the hat. Also, the auction hat badge was extremely glossy, with little to no wear. If you look at pictures of Rick Grimes wearing the sheriff's hat with a badge, you will notice that the badge is smaller in size and protrudes forward on the hat (see attached picture). The badge at Heritage Auctions was completely flat and very large. I was also able to see this hat with the badge in person when Heritage Auctions was in their New York office, and I asked the expert there about the size of the badge. He agreed with me that the badge looked different from the one pictured right next to the hat when it was displayed. He told me that when he was with AMC sourcing all the props for the auction, he worked closely with AMC and checked every box to ensure authenticity. He also noted that this hat and badge were in a museum for a couple of years before this auction, but I did not catch the location he mentioned. But when I got home that day, I rewatched every episode in which Rick Grimes wore this hat and badge, and I could not find the enlarged/flat shiny badge on the hat for the Heritage Auction.\n\nFurthermore, I also noticed that the badge on Rick's Sheriff Hat that was offered appears to have been changed/removed for Heritage Auctions' \"Auction Preview\" in Chicago in July. When you look at the badge on Rick's Sheriff Hat for that preview, you can clearly see that the enlarged/flat shiny badge appears to have been removed and replaced with a much smaller-looking badge (see attached picture).\n\nIn addition, if you look at a promotional picture that Heritage Auctions posted about Rick's Sheriff Hat and uniform, you can clearly see that the badge on that hat is the correct size and shape (see attached picture) to the one used in the show (see attached picture). So why does it appear that there is a different looking badge/hat on the promotional picture, when there was already a badge on the hat for their auction?\n\nI also completely understand that this badge may have been used elsewhere in a scene I missed, or that it was simply a backup. I just did not have a good feeling about bidding on this hat and badge due to the fact that I could not find a single scene with this exact enlarged/flat shiny badge used in the show. The auction listing did however note that \"evidence of repair to the reverse side of the sheriff badge.\" Seeing this hat and badge sell for $17,500 left me a little unsettled, given the information I stated above.\n\nIf anyone can offer information as if they agree with me or disagree with me, it would be greatly appreciated!\n\n[Heritage Auctions listing for Ricks Sheriff Hat](https://preview.redd.it/umlhwsnovg6g1.jpg?width=847&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=264e7d0d03f46ee9d25b052d3f0b4e304a93e1f3)\n\n[Ricks Sheriff Hat and badge seen on show](https://preview.redd.it/ymmzk2aqvg6g1.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27d554789f9ac47803d9b6a43bd888258a703f9b)\n\n[Heritage Auctions' \\\\\"Auction Preview\\\\\" in Chicago in July of 2025](https://preview.redd.it/en1q26nsvg6g1.png?width=2064&format=png&auto=webp&s=841f9bee24f4885b5f6827eeaf3e0c759753ce93)\n\n[Possible different looking Sheriff hat and badge as seen on Heritage Auctions instagram post](https://preview.redd.it/m0jsf76vvg6g1.png?width=2620&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0e6bd59763c97f402a0fcac887b1b0e274bbf23)\n\n",

    "text": "**TLDR:** There are no easy ways to get Pokemon cards without spending a lot per pack, sorry. \n\nBut since a lot of people keep posting and asking, this'll break down what else you can try. \n\n**Why cant I find cards:**\n\n\\-2025 Popularity Surge and Price Bubble - Starting late 2024 Pokemon card popularity began to once again surge, with the surge came scarcity as product was unable to be fulfilled to meet demand. This unprecedented demand was met with surging prices as well beginning a ridiculous value increase spiral that has caught the eyes of not just the general public but also big money investors. The more money that gets focused into the hobby, the more people start to hear about it, and unfortunately the more people try finding opportunity to make money from others in the hobby. \n\n\\-Scalpers - These are the people who follow around card vendors, buy everything they can so that others cant get it, then flip it for 2x or 3x price. If you are dedicated and thorough you can make some serious money doing this BUT IT IS HIGHLY RISKY. One bad buy could tie up thousands and waste your time trying to sell. \n\n\\-Cardshops - In response to the popularity and scalpers, many shops have taken to raising prices themselves to take in as much profit while the market is hot. Some may be scalpers themselves hitting up stores to stock their own store, or they can be in cahoots with scalpers buying at just under market price to resell above market price since its still tough to find cards. Its a two way street that never benefits the general buyer. \n\n\\-Grading - You pay a company (hopefully reputable) to assess the condition of your card. This is usually done for 2 of the many reasons, protection or resale. Since factories are pumping cards out in a mad rush, quality control is terrible. If a card is assessed at Gem Mint condition (usually listed as a 10) then it is likely in the top percentage of condition for that card, this gives it a massive premium. A card worth $100 normally can jump to thousands if it is graded highly... or you can be at a loss if it gets even one point less. \n\n\\-Investing - In a related field to scalping is investing. The difference is they are not relying on cards selling to pay their bills monthly, they are expecting to hold onto cards for 2-5 years and will wait for values to move up. They forget that card sets get printed for 1-2 years on average. There are also some who try to manipulate values to sell at higher rates, things like buying out everything below certain price thresholds so the new threshold is much higher. \n\n**I found cards but they are expensive...**:\n\n\\-Card Art Demand - Pokemon releases multiple sets a year, usually a new one every 2ish months. The newest sets have some cards that have amazing to look at art, these are what people are chasing. Pokemon tcg has rarity levels with some of the best art cards having the highest rarity. The odds of getting one of these cards is very low but a $5 pack can get you $500 if you pull the top set card, even more if you pay to grade. Popular pokemon usually are worth way more than non popular pokemon.\n\n\\-Ripoff Artists - Supply and demand baby. With so little supply getting to normal people for msrp, sellers can raise the price 2-4x even on sets that have just released. Scalping actively makes it so that this cycle continues. \n\n\\-Good Reputation Seller- Would you pay more to not deal with the stress and hassle of delayed orders, poor shipping, tampered packages, etc? Many people will justify paying a premium for convenience. There are many horror stories of people being taken advantage of, sellers capitalize on that and can charge extra for their reliability. \n\n**My Kid Wants Some, I'll Pay It**:\n\nDisclaimer - People don't need dozens of packs, they dont need hundreds of packs, and when you make it about value then it is gambling. Remember, its your collection, collect how you want, not every set needs to be 100% complete for you to be happy with it. \n\n\\-Retail Stores - Many have buy limits, many have employees who dont care about buy limits. \n\nTarget and Walmart are known for having packs at about $5 each. Scalpers love to follow the vendors around and clear out a store but if you see a card section with pokemon cards, thats probably the cheapest you'll see them. \n\nBestbuy is slightly more expensive but you may be able to find some there. \n\nGamestop is greedy and has moved their pricing to Market price... sometimes more. \n\nAldi and DollarGeneral are hit and miss. \n\nCVS/Walgreens are overpriced but may have some, they sometimes have deals.\n\n\\-Pokemoncenter.com They release randomly, its not announced. Has both extreme and terrible bot detection, as in bots can order a fair amount but clicking too quickly or erratically and a person can be banned for several hours. Currently has no cards available. \n\n\\-Pokemon Vending Machines - Release product in random intervals, constantly have technical issues, and get scalpers sitting and waiting for random interval releases. Priced at MSRP and worth checking if you happen to see one. \n\n\\-Online card stores - Everywhere is overpriced. If it isnt overpriced it will be bought out by scalpers and flipped at overpriced amounts. If you see a site that offers a good deal (30-70% off market price) and says it has product in stock, ITS A SCAM SITE. \n\n\\-Online Marketplaces - Tcgplayer is good for single cards. Ebay is good for graded cards and sealed product. Cardmarket is good for outside of USA areas. Fanatics is good for graded cards. r/pkmntcgtrades can be risky without recourse. Most everything else is going to be overpriced (tiktok, whatnot, discord, instagram)\n\n\\-Local Marketplaces - Facebook marketplace has a lot of scams but sometimes something fair. Some shops have their single card prices fair or take trade-in towards values. \n\n\\-Cardshows - 90% of product here is going to be overpriced popular graded cards. Some high value sealed stuff from big vendors might be found. Good news, you might be able to strike a deal. Caution, you might be featured on a youtube channel. \n\n**I Cant Afford Anything (Join the club)**:\n\n\\-Collections come in all shapes and sizes - Big chase cards are all the rage but there are 25 years worth of cards in the tcg's history. Some ways to collect that dont require hitting the lotto: \n\nArtists - Hundreds of artists have contributed art, find one you like and see if they have other cool art you like. \n\nThemes - Collections are personal, find a theme that means something to you, examples are background rainbows, pokemon at work, seasonal, dumb art, garden, water, weather, location based, peaceful. \n\nPokedex - Not every pokemon form has a card but most do, time to hunt down one for each 1019+ pokemon that exist. \n\n\\-Digital collecting - Pokemon has 2 apps that are free (with in game purchasing of course). Pokemon Pocket which is a watered down way to play the game but has lots of exclusive cards you can get along with free packs on a daily timer. Pokemon Live, the online version of the physical card game, tournaments can be found as well if you ever wanted to be a champion. \n\n\\-Focus on wholesome - There are plenty of ways to enjoy Pokemon even without cards. Consider making your own, some great memories can be had when you look back at your childhood creations. Fake cards arent great to support but some have fun art for a massive discount as long as you know they are fake (anything with a gold backside or silver backside or black backside is fake). Minimalism isnt a kids favorite thing, but appreciating what you do get over what you cant get is an important part of collecting. \n\n\\-Pack per dollar - At this point, just about any set is welcome for the fun of opening. They all have terrible pull rates so you should really just focus on how many packs you get for your money. \n\nInformational MSRP costs in USD - Single packs are $5, Elite trainer boxes (ETBs) are $50-60, Booster bundles are $25-30, Booster boxes are $160. Anything beyond those prices has a premium included on it. \n\n  \nThere you go, hope it helps.",

    "text": "**Heres the real number one. Thats my grandfather behind the wheel. He was chosen to head up the vette project at chevy in 53. Enlarge the pic to read the sign. Credit: Brian Forshee**\n\n\n\nCorvette historian Corey Petersen rediscovered the very first production 'Vette—chassis 3950—from 1953, hidden in a Tulsa restoration shop where it sat abandoned for years.\n\n\n\nThe automotive world just got a massive shock: the very first Chevrolet Corvette, VIN 001 (internal engineering number 3950), has resurfaced after vanishing for over 70 years. Corvette historian Corey Petersen tracked it down to a dusty corner of Lloyd Miller's restoration shop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where it languished since the early 2000s when its East Coast owner couldn't pay for work.\n\n\n\nPetersen pieced together the puzzle through exhaustive archival digs at GM's Heritage Center. Unveiled in 1953 at New York's Autorama, this hand-built pioneer from Flint, Michigan, served as GM's test mule. Engineers logged 22 modifications on work orders, from carb tweaks to chassis fixes unique scars still visible on the car today. After show duty and brutal testing, it slipped away. Many assumed it got crushed per protocol. Petersen connected dots to a mystery '53 he'd eyed there 20 years prior.\n\n\n\nThe VIN plate, stuffed in a trunk box, confirmed it: ending in 001. No theft flags, clean title history. A South Carolina owner shipped it for restoration post-VIN 003's glow-up at the same shop. Cash dried up; the car gathered dust. Petersen bought it outright, now prepping full authentication and concours restoration in his Utah collection.\n\n\n\nRemarkably intact for its age. Body needs stripping and refinishing. Chassis likely hides rust. But core components endure, positioning it as potentially the priciest Corvette alive eclipsing L88s and ZL1s at auction if papers align.",

First, I’d like to thank you for the valuable advice that some of you knowledgeable folks gave me a few months ago regarding the golden age comics that I found in my late father-in-law’s garage. The entire collection of comics were hand-delivered to Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, and I could not be more pleased with them and the entire process. At this point, it will be a fun adventure as to what they yield at their auctions! ",

    "text": "1981 Ford Fiesta Supersport. At a Glance: Rare Supersport | Period-Correct Styling | Highly Collectable Retro Ford | Only c.45k miles on the clock\n\nAuction ends on Thursday 11th December. For hundreds of photos and videos, see the auction listing here:  \n[https://www.tradeclassics.com/auctions/ford/1981-ford-fiesta-supersport-2/](https://www.tradeclassics.com/auctions/ford/1981-ford-fiesta-supersport-2/)\n\n  \nThe Ford Fiesta Supersport stands today as one of the most desirable early performance Fiestas - a model that bridged the gap between humble runabout and hot-hatch icon.\n\nIntroduced as a limited-run sporty trim prior to the arrival of the XR2, the Supersport brought bold styling, lively character and unmistakable 1980s attitude to Ford’s celebrated supermini.\n\nWith its distinctive graphics, uprated suspension, sports interior and standout road presence, the Supersport became an instant enthusiast favourite. Survivors are now increasingly sought-after, not only for their rarity but also for their pure, analogue driving feel. The unmistakable experience of a lightweight, carb-fed Ford from a golden era of performance motoring.\n\nThis particular 1981 example comes to market from \\~3.5 years with our vendor, who has cherished the car and enjoyed its retro charm. Finished in its classic Supersport livery with the correct decals, stripes and interior details, the car presents as an honest and characterful example of this now-collectable model. The interior retains its iconic tartan-style seat centres, the body displays the hallmark Supersport styling cues, and the engine bay houses its familiar, straightforward Kent motor.\n\nA rare opportunity to acquire a genuine Supersport, this Fiesta represents an appealing blend of originality, retro flair and classic Ford heritage ready to be enjoyed, lightly improved, or preserved as a charming survivor of early 1980s performance culture.\n\n",

    "text": "For some context...I'm not sure if this kind of thing seems important to you guys. To give you some context, it is a very old domain (more than 24 years old). As a digital strategy and SEO guy, I would say its quite a missed opportunity...it used to belong to this American guy that was using it as his personal \nwebsite, not keen to sell, but he let it expire, then it went into auction. If you're not a domain investor, you might consider $2759 pretty expensive, but for a national treasure and \"jiwa bangsa\" I would say its a really good price. I unfortunately got to know about the auction during the last 5 minutes.\n\nPantas.com sold for $5000, Pinjam.com for $7500, Merdeka.com for $3000...so $2759 for Bahasa.com is quite a bargain. Whoever owns it now can easily charge 10x what they bought for it, and define the term Bahasa, and most likely an Indonesian will buy it. Because thats what happened to Merdeka.com, sad isn't it...such a meaningful word.\n\nWould you have spent the money? I see a lot of people here passionate about Bahasa, and owning something like that would essentially mean the ability to define the language and coin new words...people would trust the first search engine result more than DBP. \n\nI personally think thar \"defending Bahasa\" is less about arguing what is and isn't culture, and being able to define the term and ensuring the usage of the words and language survive future generations. Having a business or startup with a Bahasa term is one way to define its meaning, like what I plan to do with Soal.my. Indonesia's attempt to claim the Kebaya (yes the dress)  their national heritage was led by their countries national domain registrar, of all gov agencies. \n\nAt that time they used kebaya.id as the campaign site, which works really well cause .ID doesn't just connotate Indonesia, it connotates identity too. Of course UNESCO didn't let them claim it. But they did try. Its kind of sad how I used to build websites on Merdeka.com but my friend sold it cause he needed the money. Its Indonesia's biggest media portal now btw. \n\nI'm aware this a really obscure hobby, and most people misunderstand it. But if there was any way to learn the language, and have fun and make money at the same time, buying/selling and developing worthy names into high traffic sites would be the way. If you're keen to learn though, do let me know. ",

    "text": "I’ve been in the hobby for a while and mostly buy singles, but I wanted to try Fanatics Collect’s Instant Rip just to see how everything works. Dropped $250 on a basketball pack just out of curiosity.\n\nI actually pulled a legit grail: a 2014 LeBron James patch card. Their system immediately showed a “value” around $1,400, which made no sense at all. Realistic value is maybe $500 to $600. So I skipped their whole end-of-process valuation and took the $1,200 instant credit. That part was easy.\n\nEverything after that… not great.\n\nThe user interface feels like it was designed by someone who doesn’t collect. It’s clunky, the layout is strange, and finding basic info takes more taps than it should. Their weekly auction structure also feels odd. Maybe there’s a reason for it, but from the outside it just seems limiting.\n\nTheir Card Ladder pricing is rough. They’re pulling comps from 2022, so you basically have to bounce between eBay and their app to figure out real values. It slows everything down and makes it hard to trust what you’re looking at.\n\nI used my $1,200 credit toward an overpriced 1980 Topps Bird–Magic–Dr. J rookie PSA 7 listed at $1,600. I paid the extra $400 cash to cover the difference and added it to my collection. Cool.\n\nThen I tried to withdraw it.\n\nThey hit me with a $75 fee.\n$48 to “withdraw” the card, with no explanation or breakdown.\n$25 shipping.\nPlus tax.\n\nPaying $75 just to get a card in hand is wild. It makes the whole thing feel like a cash grab built on keeping you inside their ecosystem and charging you every time you try to leave it.\n\nAt this point I’m deleting the app and won’t be using it again. That’s just my experience, but it was enough for me.",

Come on. Have we all forgotten the actual radioactive disasters we’ve seen over the years? Some launches were so bad they should have been investigated by a royal commission (ArcheAge anyone?). Compared to those, Aion 2 is basically a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nBut please, keep telling everyone how a 2 day old game has personally betrayed you.

Since Fanatics acquired them in 2022 I feel Topps and their other brands Allen & Ginter and Bowman have just fallen off. \n\nBased off of the reactions I saw yesterday over the Topps Cosmic Chrome release I feel Fanatics is just after nothing but money. The huge price alone was one thing but then the lack of guarantees of auto or relics just blew my mind. I grew up ripping packs with my dad and loving every second of it but now… I mean these prices and then being told “hey you might only get base cards” is a wild wild approach. ",

Meanwhile, our price point continues to skyrocket and new collectors are fooled into believing that the \"only way they hit\" is to buy a lottery ticket in a break.   \n  \nWhen will we finally collectively STOP funding the middlemen and get back to our hobby being accessible to us all?",

My biggest question is are we going to keep getting Topps brand basketball cards or is Fanatics going to release their own line? Is Panini still going to release all its same lines season, but unlicensed? And what happens to all the premium/unique lines like immaculate, national treasures, court kings, black, etc.  Panini had so many lines that took them so many years to build, do you guys think we’re just going to have one or two tops basketball lines for the next few seasons? And then what happens to all the penny cards that exist with a licensing? Will they eventually lose any value? So many questions! Thanks!",

    "text": "Renault is throwing open the doors to its legendary private collection, auctioning off 100 classic vehicles on December 7th, 2025. From century-old icons to turbocharged racers, here’s everything we know and a growing list of the cars set to make history.\n\nRenault collectors, start your engines this is the kind of once-in-a-lifetime auction petrolheads dream about. In a high-profile clearout before launching its sparkling new heritage museum outside Paris in 2027, Renault is set to auction off 100 historic and rare classic cars. The sale follows the brand’s decision to keep its core collection to 600 vehicles, passing duplicates (and a few oddballs) onto the hands of lucky bidders and clubs across the globe.​\n\n# Why Is Renault Selling These Cars?\n\nRenault’s private stash spans over 800 vehicles, but with the new Flins-sur-Seine heritage centre in the works, they’re streamlining. Offloading duplicates means the best, most unique examples stay in France, while rare and legendary pieces some seen only in obscure press photos hit the open market for the first time ever.\n\n# What’s on Offer?\n\nWhile Renault and Artcurial Motorcars are keeping some surprises for the live event, teasers have revealed a mouthwatering line-up:\n\n# Early Icons\n\n* **1898 Type A Replicas**: Limited-run tribute cars, including ICE and electric versions, built for the centenary.\n* **1901 Type D**: Original, running, founder-era machinery.\n* **1933 Bus**: Big prewar people-mover with huge history.\n\n# Motorsport Royalty\n\n* **Up to Twenty Turbo Formula 1 Cars (1981–1985)**: Including the RS01 (F1’s first turbo car), the race-winning RE40 (Belgian Grand Prix 1983), driven by names like Alain Prost, René Arnoux, Jean-Pierre Jabouille, Eddie Cheever, and Patrick Tambay.​\n* **Renault Alpine A442**: The Le Mans legend (1978).\n* **Lotus 95T (1984)**: The F1 chassis that saw fierce competition.\n\n# Rally and Oddities\n\n* **Renault 5 Maxi Turbo Prototype**\n* **Renault Megane Trophy V6**\n* **Renault RE27B (other race cars)**\n\n# Unique Concepts & Prototypes\n\n* **Marquette d’étude concept cars**\n* **Wind tunnel development models**\n* **Driver suits, memorabilia, vintage workshop clocks, F1 engines, and more automobilia.**\n\n# Modern and Cult Classics\n\n* **Clio, Dauphine, Renault 5, ZOE prototypes**\n* **2016 Renault Alaskan Concept** (Yes, the pick-up)\n* **Road and rally cars from nearly every decade**\n\nNearly ninety percent of these lots come with **no reserve**. As Pierre Novikoff of Artcurial Motorcars puts it, “We are offering collectors a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: the chance to become a curator of this rich heritage.”​\n\n# How Can You Bid?\n\nThe sale takes place at Renault’s legendary Flins factory near Paris on 7 December 2025, with an exhibition running from December 4th-7th. If you can’t be there in person, online and telephone bids are expected to be available for international buyers.​\n\n# Why Does This Matter?\n\nFor fans, clubs, and collectors, this auction is a rare chance to buy straight from the factory, often for less than you’d ever dream (thanks to no-reserve status). Memorabilia and one-off objects like wind tunnel models and prototype parts sweeten the deal for the most obsessive fans.\n\n# [Confirmed and Featured Cars Here](https://gaukmotorbuzz.com/news/renault-s-big-heritage-clearout--100-classic-cars-up-for-auction--full-list-and-what-you-need-to-know)",

They have to inspect it before sending it to me.\n\nWhen a deal is reached, you are informed to pay the total invoice - which I did - but the payment is not applied to your card/bank account until Heritage receives the item - then they inspect and prepare for shipping. Right before it's shipped, you get an email from Heritage indicating that the payment has been applied to the card (or whatever payment source you selected).\n\nI was informed by USPS that a shipment is coming from Heritage tomorrow - and this is the only item I'm expecting - but the associated Heritage invoice is still marked as \"pending\" and they have not applied the payment to the card.\n\nHas anyone else had this happen in an offer to owner purchase, where you received an item before payment was actually applied?\n\nSince the owner needs to get paid from my funds, I fully expect them to get around to charging me - but very weird scenario that I've never seen before with Heritage.",

    "text": "Hi all. I’ve been following this thread for a bit and really appreciate the expertise shown here.  \n\nI have some questions I’m hoping the community can help with. I’ve tried to dig through the FAQ and previously posts to find answers but haven’t quite fully answered them. Apologies if this comes across as repetitive in any way - trying my best to ask questions others could find helpful too. \n\n\n1.  Are there particular “bidding strategies” that you recommend for both winning and not overpaying in auctions?  For example - is there any true advantage to using the pre-bid system or is the best route to always try to live bid?  Seems like pre bidding is mostly in the favor of the auction house, unless of course you want to place a really large max bid before anyone else has the chance.  \n\n\n2.  Are all auctions listed through Numisbids “legit” in the sense that each and every auction house is fully vetted and held to highest standards? Or is this still really up to the bidder to read into each auction house. \n\n3.  Are auctions where dealers usually get their inventory? I assume they get inventory through a combination of coin shows, direct purchases, auctions, etc - but curious if auctions are the primary day-to-day way of getting inventory. \n\nOr are auctions  more “retail” in nature?\n\n4.  Do coins typically sell at higher prices in North American auctions like Heritage, as opposed to auctions in Germany, etc, where listings are not in English and US buyers must pay for international shipping, customs, etc.?  I assume (maybe incorrectly) that North American buyers can heavily skew outcomes of auctions.  seems like I’ve seen higher prices for similar coins at Heritage, for example. \n\n5.  If a coin doesn’t sell at auction, can you email the auction house and make an offer for their coin (say at the opening bid price which wasn’t met)? I see some auctions offer instant purchase of non-sold coins, but not all of them do. Curious if it’s acceptable practice to just email them for a direct purchase. \n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "\n**Pawnshop No. 7** \n\nStarring **Wang Haozhen & Wang Yunyun**\n\nIt’s on our Playlist\n➡️ https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt8R0uTGorAUg1s5b4JZ8tEKw42aBTZQj&si=IEdMbfWxDDm7vGjz\n\nI had no intention to add  a Vertical Vortex to my postings this week- but I have no intention to let this one pass by unnoticed! \n**I’m obsessed with this dramas aesthetic, story and romance.**\n⸻\n\n🌟 **The Story**\n\nThey meet at an auction. Shen Zhuo (WHZ) and Su Mian (WYY) both bid on the same item.\n\nHe believes the broken mirror artifact will heal his grandfather — she knows it’s a gateway for malevolent spirits.\n\nHe’s a tough CEO — front-row seated, arrogant, and rich. The auction only begins once she walks in and gets the full VVIP treatment. He doesn’t recognize her — she’s a novelty in his world.\n\nWhen she hands him her business card, bats her eyes so confident and  flirtatious, and says,\n\n„Contact me if it’s too much for you,“\n\nhe snarls… but keeps her card. 👀\n\n⸻\n\n💭 **My Thoughts**\n\nAt first, I wasn’t sure I’d like the drama’s visual style — but I immediately fell in love with it. \nThe golden-toned color scheme creates a warm, rich atmosphere — a world outside of time. \nThey use smartphones, but the women’s fashion is Republican-era inspired. It’s a fantasy world. \n\n💫 And her magic? Elegant, sparkling, and full of golden dust.\n\n⸻\n\nTo understand the story — and this review — I need to explain more:\n\n>!She’s the last descendant of a magical family still cleaning up after a centuries-old battle. The other three families who fought the Wu family (evil magic users) have long forgotten their duty. The war destroyed their city, and her Lin family sealed the Wu underground. Artifacts sold as antiques now carry the Wu’s vengeful spirits — they possess bodies and seek revenge. The descendants of these families  must face this truth, rediscover their heritage, and reunite. It’s a drama where friendships form, fracture, and evolve.!<\n\n⸻\n\nThe mirror releases a spirit that possesses Grandpa — it doesn’t heal him.\n“Grandpa Possessed” is terrifying 😨 — >!he’s a Zombie with red glowing eyes, going for the throat, the only missing piece was that he’d say  „brains!!“ !< - but her card appears in the air… and it transforms into golden chains that bind him. It’s 💥\n\nFrom there, the story truly begins.\n\nShe’s called in to help, but her fee?\nThree months.\nWHZ must live with her, take care of her — and yes, physical contact is required. 😏\n\nHe fumes but agrees.\n\n⸻\n\n💞 **Their Relationship**\n\nShe’s his boss and insists on her “rights” (she loves hugs). She teases him, flirts, and gets under his skin.\n\nHe resists… but ends up doing everything — hugs, kisses, cooking, cleaning.\n\nSoon, he realizes she’s selfless — her life consumed by her duty.\nNo one in her family has lived past age 29. 🕯️\n\nHis physical presence strengthens her broken body — her biological age (not her looks!) is over 100 years. Every evil spirit she destroys drains her life away.\n\nHow could he not fall for her? ❤️\n\n>!The only weakness: I detest women babying themselves to be more lovable, that’s what the fl does. *The way she drinks out of the cup via straw is so little girl coded- I still shudder* Maybe it’s to emphasize that she’s magically strong but still *just a girl standing before a boy asking him to love her*, but- can’t they find another way?!< she was so badass in every other aspect or scene. \n\n!He stops being her reluctant partner and becomes the man who loves her, even when she’s the only one strong enough to fight — and fades away in his arms. What do you do then? You cook. You carry. You stay.!<\n\n⸻\n\n🥂**Favorite Moments**\n\nHer CEO entry! \n\nAnd his face whenever the CEO trope is turned against him e.g. he’s asked to „show sincerity“ or forced to hug.\n\n⚡️ **TL;DR**\n\nWe Have:\n\n💍 A fiancée chosen by his family\n\n🎗️ A supportive sister and friend \n\n⛓️ An ancient curse\n\n🔥 A desperate man and woman \n\n👁️‍🗨️ A hidden enemy\n\n💔 A love >!that faces the ultimate choice — > only one can live… or can they find another way?!<\n\n⸻\n\n✨ **The Verdict**\n\nMagic — it’s breathtaking, golden, and beautiful.\nI absolutely loved it. 💛\n\n📺 It’s on my immediate rewatch list, with a sticky note:\n\nWHZ! The arrogant CEO who turns into a cute didi whenever she’s around. \n\nIt’s a MUST see if you need to see a warm and supportive relationship growing \n\nIt’s as well a MUST see for WHZ fans *and not for THE kiss only*\n\n\n⸻\n\nSpice 🔥🔥🔥\n\nSweet 🌹🌹🌹🌹\n",

    "text": "As you can guess, I love Moira and I am very interested in collecting merch of her... the problem is, she's a bit more of a niche character compared to the heavy hitters like Mercy and Kiriko and whatnot, so her merch is a lot more rare and there's a lot less information about it online.\n\nThat's where this post comes in! After a LOT of research and combing through some shady websites, I've compiled what should be (at least close to) the definitive list of all officially licensed Blizzard merchandise that features Moira! Unfortunately, some of these items aren't available anymore, even on secondhand websites like eBay, but others might be easier to find. And obviously this list doesn't touch on any fanmade or bootleg merch, which is of course gonna be cheaper and more readily available. I was just interested in the official stuff.\n\n(Also these links are just for proof that these items actually exist, I don't know if most or any of these sites are legit, so if you decide to buy them that's on you. Nothing here is endorsed or sponsored and its just for illustrative purposes. Shop at your own risk...)\n\nSo, that said, here's the list!\n\n[**Funko POP! Games Overwatch Moira Vinyl Figure**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Funko-POP-Games-Overwatch-Moira-Vinyl-Figure/406156994)\n\nPretty straightforward, this was her Funko pop figure that released alongside a bunch of other later Overwatch 1 heroes. Sadly there's no other cool variants of this one.\n\n[**Cute But Deadly Series 5**](https://www.amazon.sg/Overwatch-Cute-But-Deadly-5/dp/B07FN4NR9L)\n\nThis is Moira's only other actual figure, its 2 inches tall and is part of a series of mystery grab bags.\n\n[**Blizzcon Series 6 Pin**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/205309034136)\n\nOfficial metal pin depicting Moira, released as part of a line of Blizzcon exclusive pins in 2019.\n\n[**Blizzcon Series 6 GOLD Pin**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/126180568935)\n\nThis pin comes from the same line but is instead has a golden appearance, and is also a 3D mold. Not really sure of its rarity/price compared to the original version at release.\n\n[**2023 Upper Deck Blizzard Legacy Collection Emotes! Moira #E-16**](https://www.comc.com/Cards/Non-Sports/2023/Upper_Deck_Blizzard_Legacy_Collection_-_Emotes/E-16/Moira/24702330)\n\nThis one I could barely find any information on, but from what I could gather, its from a series of trading cards of a bunch of Blizzard characters. The Overwatch ones got animated holographic emote cards, coming in different rarities ranging from standard to rare to legendary.\n\n[**2023 Upper Deck Blizzard Legacy Collection Ultimate Ready Moira #UR-16**](https://www.mercari.com/us/item/m34460826434/)\n\nSame series I think, this time each Overwatch hero gets a card depicting their Ultimate ability.\n\n[**Overwatch 2 x RED° TOKYO TOWER**](https://www.ebay.com/itm/317047854262)\n\nThis is probably the rarest and most expensive Moira merch out there. Back in 2024 an in-person only event took place at the digital theme park RED° TOKYO TOWER which was a collab with Blizzard. It featured a pop-up shop and exclusive merchandise for (I think) most of the Overwatch 2 cast, including Moira. She got a standee, a keychain, and metal button, all having the same artwork of her Overwatch 2 design.\n\n[**Overwatch Glam Moira Hot Topic Shirt**](https://www.hottopic.com/product/overwatch-glam-moira-t-shirt/12054420.html)\n\nThis was a Hot Topic exclusive t-shirt featuring art by Kelly Johnson depicting Moira's 'Glam' skin.\n\n[**Uniqlo X Blizzard Overwatch Moira T-Shirt**](https://www.play-asia.com/ut-blizzard-entertainment-moira-mens-t-shirt-blue-xl-size/13/70cpa1)\n\nA blue shirt with one of Moira's purple orbs on the front, part of the Blizzard x Uniqlo UT collab (which is a Japanese clothing brand, go figure).\n\n[**Moira Overwatch J!NX Contrast Ultimate Hoodie**](https://www.fanatics.com/blizzard-entertainment/overwatch/moira-overwatch-j!nx-contrast-ultimate-full-zip-hoodie-black/o-21945775+t-76164678+p-036284376+z-9-87463409)\n\nI'm so bummed this one is sold out. Its a very cool Moria ultimate themed hoodie that was part f a Blizzard collab with the San Diego based clothing brand J!NX. Her and a bunch of other Overwatch heroes also got these Ultimate themed hoodies.\n\n[**Moira vs Reaper Stadium Shirt**](https://gear.blizzard.com/products/overmt5002-overwatch-stadium-hero-t-shirt)\n\nHonestly this one is only notable because its the only one that's, as of right now, still actively being sold by Blizzard. Its a shirt that features a Stadium battle between Moira and Reaper and features her Multi-Orb power.\n\n[**Overwatch tokidoki X Series 3 Notebook: Heroes Theme**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Overwatch-Tokidoki-X-Series-3-Notebook-Heroes-Theme-Hardcover-9781945683817/901291220)  \n[**Overwatch tokidoki X Series 3 Notebook: Talon Theme**](https://business.walmart.com/ip/Overwatch-Tokidoki-X-Series-3-Notebook-Talon-Theme-Hardcover-9781945683794/375528962)\n\ntokidoki is an Italian-based art brand with Japanese influences, and they've supposedly worked with Blizzard since 2016 and have done a variety of items together including hats, shirts, purses... but unfortunately, the only stuff they did that features Moira are notebooks. Speaking of...\n\n[**Overwatch: All Over Character Icon Notebook**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Overwatch-All-Over-Character-Icon-Notebook-Hardcover-9781945683350/478533602)\n\nYeah this is just a generic notebook that has a bunch of Hero icons, including Moira's.\n\n[**The Overwatch Pachimari Heroes Notebook**](https://www.amazon.com/Overwatch-Pachimari-Heroes-Notebook/dp/1950366030)\n\nAnd its the exact same story here, but with her Pachimari.\n\n[**Overwatch: Pachimari Heroes Puzzle**](https://www.midtowncomics.com/product/1843702)  \n[**Overwatch: Cute But Deadly Heroes Puzzle**](https://dryad-games.com/shop/overwatch-cute-but-deadly-heroes-puzzle/)\n\nFolks, we are really scraping the bottom of the barrel here... they're puzzles. Thankfully, they both feature Moira.\n\n[**Overwatch Monopoly Collector's Edition**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/272803/monopoly-gamer-overwatch-collectors-edition)\n\nIncluded in the Overwatch Monopoly board game is a deck of cards that has hero cards for all of the Overwatch characters (up until like... Orisa I think). And there's a Moira card!\n\n[**Overwatch: Declassified - An Official History**](https://www.amazon.com/Overwatch-Declassified-Official-Seanan-McGuire/dp/1803361662)  \n[**Overwatch: The Official Cookbook**](https://www.amazon.com/Overwatch-Official-Cookbook-Chelsea-Monroe-Cassel/dp/1683835883)\n\nI know these are literally just books but I'm counting them anyway. There's some cool canon information about Moira given in both of these, naturally just a couple pages...\n\nAaaaand that's literally everything I was able to find! To the best of my knowledge all of these items are officially licensed Blizzard merchandise. If there are any other official Moira items that I missed, please let me know in the comments so I can add them to the post! ",

    "text": "So I  just got my Wayne Gretzky Topps rookie card back. Can someone explain this grade to me. It’s a EX-MT 6. The only thing wrong with this card is the centering on the back is off right to left. I’ve taken this to card shops and to sports card conventions and the dealers who I’ve talked to who also grade cards have all said that this would be a minimum 8.5 on the grading system, just because the centering on the back. I’ve held onto this card since I got it in a pack when I was a freshman in high school in 79-80 waiting to sell it. It looks like a defect on the top but it’s the lighting and reflection. The edges are all clean, the colors are still bright, it’s centered on the front almost perfect. There are no spots. I’m just devastated with this grade. Do you think the graders were just having a bad day? I just don’t get it, especially comparing these images with the cards that have sold on Heritage auctions with some of the issue they have like centering which had much higher grades than this. \n\nThanks in advance for any insight into this.",

    "text": "Hello everyone! \n\nI've been using the Z Flip 5 for a few months now, so I wanted to drop a review on it and a comparison to my old phone, the Note 9. I wanted to drop a detailed review so other Note 9 users have some sort of comparison if they decide to switch. \n\nIll start off by saying that I had my Note 9 since launch until about July 2025. While I agree with all the fanatics that the Note 9 is currently still the greatest phone ever produced, the age of the phone was definitely catching up. My screen and frame has been replaced twice and my battery three times, so the phone has been through it. \n\nUnfortunately, the phone was dropped on asphalt, screen side down without a screen protector. I figure you probably don't need a crystal ball to figure out what happened next. With my shattered screen, I went to google to find replacement parts. OLED screens for sale are either LCD, have defects, or cost basically the same as a new phone. I was seriously considering purchasing a new Note 9, however the lack of security updates and my wife's constant nagging to get a new phone had made getting a whole other phone a possibility. \n\nNow, I'll go over why I loved the Note 9 so much:\n\n1. The Bixby Button - Samsung's greatest feature Imo. After remapping, the button is basically your home button but placed exactly where your thumb would be, making one handed operation a breeze. Not sure why it gets so much hate. \n\n2. SD card slot & Headphone jack - It's the year 2025, we should have these \"features\"\n\n3. Fingerprint scanner on the back - Perfect positioning, typically where my finger would be upon picking up the phone. \n\n4. No notch in screen, Back Camera flush with the back - Cosmetic but definitely nice to have. \n\nNow, while I could accept giving up 2 & 4, the one handed operation with the Bixby button and Fingerprint scanner were going to be the things I miss the most, as the QoL they add to my phone experience is invaluable. \n\nSo, I went to the market and decided to search for a new phone. While my wife paid for the phone (lucky me!), getting a brand new phone just really didn't make any sense to me, regardless if we could comfortably afford it or not. I had basically narrowed it down to 2 phones, the Sony Xperia V and the S23 Ultra. The Xperia was just to expensive for what it offered and the S23 ultra was basically just my Note 9 with less features. \n\nThen, I saw it. A Z Flip 5 on Best Buy marketplace, almost brand new condition . A flip phone was never on my radar, due to the perceived delicateness of the phone. However, after doing some research, and seeing JerryRigs Test and Teardown of the phone, I was impressed and figured if I was giving up the greatest phone ever, might as well get something cool. \n\nSo, I decided to take the risk. The phone was about $570 CAD IIRC, and came in basically new condition. I will however recommend EXTREME caution when buying a used flip phone. I wouldn't recommend getting a refurbished flip phone more then ONE generation old, as anything older won't qualify for Samsung Care. With the inner screen replacement costing as much as the phone itself, it is incredibly unwise to use the phone without warranty or coverage. I am essentially rawdogging the phone and hoping for the best. DON'T DO THIS. \n\nSo, I'll go over why I chose the Z Flip 5:\n\n1. Small Size Factor - Probably everyone's #1. \n\n2. It's cool - Despite the fact we are on the 7th iteration of a folding phone, I still get quite a few comments on the phone, which surprises me as I live in a city and the forms factor itself isn't something totally new. \n\n3. Cover screen - The game changer. More below. \n\n4. Physical Fingerprint Scanner - allows for one handed operation, very consistent. \n\nIn terms of using my Z Flip 5, the cover screen has revolutionized the way I see a phone. The cover screen can run any app with GoodLock, and with some macros to add rotation and resizing, the screen becomes infinitely more useful, to the point that about 85% of the time, the phone is closed. It basically makes the phone a small phone, that folds out into a bigger phone, not vice versa. \n\nOne handed operation was so important to me as you can see, so the loss of my beloved Bixby button was offset by the fact that I can actually now reach everything on the screen. The fingerprint scanner is in a decent position. \n\nThe phone is significantly much sturdier than I initially thought. Hinge feels solid, dropped a few times with no major damage, inner screen has less scratches over these few months then I expected. \n\n\nNow I'll go over the bad :\n\n1. Battery Life - no sugarcoating it. It sucks. \n\n2. Warranty coverage - mentioned above but felt it had to be mentioned again\n\n3. Screen Format: Inner screen is narrower and taller, making some content viewing awkward. Also causes formatting issues on apps when going from cover screen to inner screen. \n\n4. Screen protector : while mine hasn't had issues, if the protector needs to be replaced, it needs to be done by Samsung and costing around $80 CAD IIRC. This is important, as screen protector failure typically leads to complete screen failure from what I've seen. \n\n5. The crease - It's there. Can cause optical illusions on the screen depending on the angle you look at it (identical to the curved edges of Samsung's S Ultra line). \n\n6. Durability - While the phone is sturdy and sound, it won't ever match the construction of Gorilla Glass and a solid foundation. Drops are blood pressure inducing.\n\n7. No Samsung Dex - not a deal breaker, but it's 2025.\n\nSo there it is. My experience leaving the Note 9 family to the Flip Side. Sorry if the post is too long (or not long enough). Just wanted to be though as I know how hard it is to part with such a great phone. Z flip 5 is still going strong with no issues. Going forward, I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to candy bar for factor, the cover screen is just too convenient. \n\nFeel free to ask any questions! ",

    "text": "I'm a pretty moderate guy in life but if you have a heart, a soul you cannot deny the immense purposeful cruelty of MAGA and Donald \"I'm not in the Epstein files\" Trump. I don't care who you are or where you come from, what god you subscribe to or what side of the aisle you align with, this man and his cohort of supplicant dogs are destroying this country.\n\nJust 2 weeks ago I nearly got detained by ICE for trying to stop these animals from arresting a family off Broadacres Marketplace in Vegas. Literally smashed 3 of their windows, dragged two parents out of their car, knees on backs while their two young kids were crying in the car glass all over these kids too. These guys nearly jumped me as I was trying to get their names and information, one straight up said to me \"you come close and you're next\" I couldn't tell they were Latino, European or any other immigrant background in all honesty at all they just looked like average white people maybe half a shade more tanned it's Vegas we regularly have 100 degree summers tanning people naturally and I'm pretty sure these guys didn't care the man they detained kept saying he was a citizen they just didn't care. Luckily my twin brother called Vegas PD before dragging me a safe distance away because in that moment I wanted to lay these guys out which woulda landed me in Nigeria for all we know and for once I was glad the police showed up de-escalated the situation. That family got to walk free because we called the POLICE but no doubt they are traumatised by this shit who wouldn't be in that situation? Is there any news coverage any 6 o'clock news story on this no, If I was them I would leave the country after something like that no way you would feel safe sending your kids to schools where they can get shot at and pick them up only to be fucking detained by ICE. There are probably hundreds of thousands stories like this happening right now and that worries me. How long can this go on for, how long is it gonna be until they just take Americans off the street because they don't care if you are a migrant or not. I didn't need to have the IRL experience to tell you that this current environment is simply unsustainable because there are no guard rails, no due process, no accountability. Why do ICE wear these masks? they know what they are doing is fucking illegal and don't want to be recognised for their actions because that would mean actual consequences. How long is it gonna be until you aren't \"American\" enough and get detained for it?\n\nAnd the kicker is Obama deported tons of people, way more than Trump in his first term I and many others won't debate that fact but he didn't send paid masked up goons with the authority of the President and more job security than a civil servant into minority neighborhoods to literally de-humanise and assault people in front of their kids as they send them to god knows where and call that shit righteous or justice. We still don't know where the hundreds of missing people who got sent to \"Alligator Alcatraz\" went and nobody gives a shit.\n\nI've seen the impact of this government's god awful actions here at home, Vegas is dead, in 10 months tourism is gone these once bustling strips are empty, nobody wants to come here to the US let alone Vegas, nobody can afford to go out here or even wants to risk being caught up in this shitstorm here anymore. I work in finance I will tell you for free we are gonna be in a recession by the years end, no amount of tariff revenue can cover the gigantic holes in our economy being held up by the few US tech companies run by tech oligarchs right now profiting off the AI bubble before it bursts. Right now Nvidia has $4.6 trillion market cap, our entire pharmaceutical industry has a combined market cap of $4.2 trillion. If Nvidia has a bad day on the markets it now literally impacts the entire US economy.\n\nWhen it comes to trade relations just give up Trump has alienated and threatened our own allies with his dumbass policy, yes start a trade war with China lets see how that will go for us when we haven't had a robust manufacturing industry for the last 50 years because we outsource everything. It will just get to a point where the rest of the world will just turn their back on America because who would genuinely want work with us after all that has happened now? Just look at the Hyundai plant raid in Georgia that happened in September, 1 dumb woman named Tori Branum who mind you was running for Georgia's 12th congressional district gave a tip to ICE about foreigners who were Korean nationals trying to train workers and get the Hyundai, 475 South Korean workers all here legally got detained by ICE. Now these guys got released eventually but all these workers all but 1 decided to leave and never return so we have a Hyundai Plant in Georgia that cost upwards of $7 billion to even build is now empty with no one to train AMERICAN workers for the job let alone actually work. South Korea is one of the largest foreign investors in the US and we have now given them no reason to trust us, same with China, India and others. We are risking cooperation and actual growth over the same culture wars that the Right criticizes constantly.\n\nBut we have bigger shit to worry about we might heading into a fucking war with what seems to me South America and any other country our Commander in Queef and Weekend Warrior Pete decide to extrajudicially kill the citizens of with no evidence. So much for being the \"no wars\" President.\n\nEpstein, Venezuela, the US and Trump being in an abusive relationship with Isreal basically funding a genocide with our tax dollars, Tariffs, ICE raids, thoughts and prayers for mass shootings that happen every week, tearing down the East Wing for a $200m Gilded age ballroom that will be used 5 times a year while people starve, lose their healthcare and lose their jobs, crypto coins, merch, selling off US land to foreign countries like Qatar so they can build a military base in Idaho, sending in the military against the civilian population, literal AI shitposts by the leader of the free world, shutting down the government because you simply just don't want people your people to have affordable healthcare. I can't even keep track of all of this dangerous low IQ BS  but all I know is that this house of cards will fall but it will be Americans who pay the price.\n\nAnd to the people who voted for a overgrown, obese nepo baby who inherited his wealth and didn't earn anything in his life did you really think that the billionaire convicted felon rapist older than color TV's was gonna look out for you or this country? You are rubes of the highest order. I truly hope I am alive and free to see these people be held accountable for the sheer corruption and warping of a country I once loved.",

    "text": "Of course it doesn't apply to everyone, but there are SOME folks who will be starting PC gaming for the first time this week, or coming back to it after a decade or more of console gaming. That's literally the situation I was in when I got my Ally one year ago, and so I'm pretty interested in helping each other and learning from each other. So, I wanted to post what I have learned in \\~20 months of PC gaming. Interested to hear what others think for advice or questions as we enter this awesome day.\n\n* **Compare prices** \\-- SteamDB and IsThereAnyDeal are your friends. Watch for historic lows and 1-year lows, and know that Steam sales are super frequent. PC Gamers with more restraint than I have some time live by a rule that they don't buy games they aren't going to play right away, others build a backlog that is somewhat unimaginable on console, and this happens very quickly for most PC gamers who just buy something they think looks great that \"I'll play this one day.\"\n* **Know the difference between Official Storefronts and Keyshops** \\-- Keyshops can be linked to blackmarket things like credit card theft, and when a credit card company collects, it can cause indie developers and publishers to flip the bill because their product was purchased with a stolen CC. Keyshop marketplaces can also get you all hooked up with independent keysellers which may or may not be... decent humans. Some official storefronts I appreciate in the US are Green Man Gaming, Fanatical, and Humble.\n* **Consider Bundles** If you want a big backlog; don't look at them if you have a problem with compulsive buying. The same three sites I just mentioned each release game bundles more or less weekly. DailyIndieGames and IndieGala both do as well, with the quality of the games being considerably lower-- they're essentially bundle sites that have already failed. Fanatical shines in genre- or theme-specific \"Build Your Own\" bundles of indie games, as well as occassional charity and \"killer\" bundles that are usually quite worth it. Humble has bundles that vary in value quite a bit, but when they launch a bundle that's up your alley, it will be a short opportunity to get a great deal on some games you'll love. GMG is brand new to this game-- their first bundle was awesome, their second one kinda objectively sucked. For GMG and Humble, remember to toggle your donation to charity to distribute your purchase as you see fit (Shop vs Publishers vs Charity). Humble Choice is a subscription service you should look into, especially with likely upcoming holiday deals that will help you get the subscription at around 10-12$ / month. Look at r/HumbleBundle for info on this, user experience, as well as issues people sometimes run into with their keys. \n   * Sites like [barter.vg](http://barter.vg) can let you know how frequently a game has been bundled, and if doing something fun with your keys, the discussions on steamgifts can help you be aware of your key’s regions.  With the influx of PC gamers, publishers are being more cautious about key expirations and region restrictions.\n* **Don't buy random key bundles** if you haven't looked at what kind of games people are getting from them. Sites like r/GameBundles and SteamGifts are great for seeing random pulls. Anyone not expecting 20-year old games and indies they've never heard of are a bit deluded; highly recommend not buying a random bundle from a keyshop-- even if you like gambling, stick to Fanatical for these.\n* **Claim your Freebies**. If you're willing to play outside of Steam, set up an account on Epic Games Store (you can just use your XB API to login), and claim their freebies, which launch for one week every Thursday, outside of holiday specials.  Currently Amnesia: The Bunker just went live, as did Samorost 3. \n   * Prime Gaming (likely to be renamed per news this month) also gives free GOG and Epic Games Store, as well as Amazon Games, another PC launcher, and even Xbox games for free to anyone who has a Prime membership.  The games aren’t worth the subscription alone, but for gamers they are certainly one of the coolest perks. These also launch on Thursdays with this week’s highlights including Fallout: New Vegas, with still-available games like Afterimage, a popular metroidvania.\n   * Discord servers like [Pantaloon's ](https://discord.gg/BC5mhMfg)have free game bots that will alert you when a game is on sale for -100% on Steam, but you can also use SteamDB and ITAD for this manually.\n   * Armoury Crate makes it pretty easy to launch these on Allys.\n\n ",

    "text": "**For the first time, Ford’s pulling a 2006 GT Heritage Edition from its exclusive Heritage Collection and putting it up for auction at Barrett-Jackson to support other classic vehicle restorations.**\n\n\n\n\n\nFord is opening its vault for a rare treat: a 2006 Ford GT Heritage Edition, Production No. 3, is going to cross the auction block at Barrett-Jackson’s Scottsdale Fall event in October 2025. This is the first time Ford has released such a gem from its Heritage Collection, a carefully curated fleet of almost 500 spectacular vehicles.\n\n\n\nThis GT is a true masterpiece finished in head-turning Gulf livery colors: Epic Orange and Heritage Blue, celebrating Ford’s victorious legacy at the legendary Le Mans endurance race. Under the hood roars a supercharged 5.4-liter V8 pumping out 550 horsepower and 500 pound-feet of torque, paired with a six-speed manual transmission for that pure, unfiltered driving experience.\n\n\n\nOnly 343 Heritage Editions were produced, and this specific car was owned and used exclusively by Ford during various media and marketing campaigns. Accompanying the sale is a “Build Book” documenting every detail from assembly, and a certificate of authenticity to guarantee its legitimacy.\n\n\n\nThe auction promises fierce bidding with estimated values between eight hundred thousand to one million dollars, and all proceeds will go straight back into maintaining and restoring Ford’s sprawling Heritage Fleet. The collection spans vehicles in locations across the US, UK, Germany, and Australia and includes iconic vehicles such as the original sixth-generation Bronco prototype and the world’s only V-10-powered Mustang.\n\n\n\nFor enthusiasts and collectors, this is a rare chance to own a significant piece of Ford history while supporting preservation efforts for other classic vehicles in the Blue Oval’s precious collection.\n\n\n\nThe auction runs October 15 to 18 at WestWorld of Scottsdale, offering car lovers a front-row seat to one of the most prestigious collector car sales of 2025.",

    "text": "Alright TAG gang- Couple of friends suggested I should post this data here as it would benefit everyone dealing with the wild west rodeo of TAG comps. I see a LOT of heated discussion related to how TAG should be comped- Eventually I got tired of the debate and decided to kill 3-4 hours to know for sure.\n\n**I understand that a lot of TAG sellers / vendors abide by a PSA 85-95% rule** \\- however more often than not, *to those that aren't TAG collectors, its not something known, or believed.*\n\n***Can the data back that rule up?***\n\n# Problem Outline: \n\n* *Lack of historical data (Normative Authority) on Ebay Last Solds causes friction between buyers, vendors, and graders at Card Shows, Ebay, Facebook Marketplace, etc.*\n* Variation in price or outright exclusion of TAG in PriceCharting, Collectr, CardLadder, and other aggregators causes uncertainty and inability to reach comp agreements.\n\n**I want to start this series with Charizard EX #199, because:**\n\n* Extremely Popular Modern / Charizard -> It has an abundance of Sold Data\n* High Value <$1000 -> Big Liquidity\n\n# Data Controls:\n\n1. TAG & PSA data was pulled using Ebay Research Seller Tool (public) from \\[7/14/25\\] to \\[10/13/25\\].\n2. Pulled data ONLY for \\[TAG10's\\] & \\[PSA10's\\].\n3. Filtered OUT RAW, BGS, CGC, (and other weird combo deals), etc.\n\n**Please NOTE the limitations for Data Analysis:**\n\n* **Data is unable to contextualize seller TAT (Turnaround Time)**\n* Ebay marketplace does not encompass all market activity, and the 13-15% seller fee is considerable drag for people wanting to list to Ebay.\n* Consider that a LARGE proportion of TAG sales happen offline at Card Shows, FB Marketplace, etc, but IRL markets calibrate to last solds. (I know this is normal, but it's actually insane to think about.)\n\n# Major Key Insights (aka TLDR):\n\n* **TAG 10 Slabs fetch an average 89% to their PSA 10 counterpart.**\n* **(Pre-Mania) -** *observing prices pre-pump $1k, the relative TAG to PSA comp range was narrow (82%-98%):*\n   * Normal Thought cycle: \"I know what this zard is worth, this is a staple, solid card I can sell at $600-$800\"\n* **(Mania / Elevated Prices) -** *observing prices post-pump $1k, the relative TAG to PSA comp range becomes volatile and expands (75%-115%)*\n   * **There is a clear bifurcation of the types of market participation here, especially at a $1k psychological level:**\n   * **Sellers / Vendors taking profit, derisking or flipping TAG under 80%:** \n      * \"dang I should really offload this since its pumping regardless\"\n      * There's an element of turnaround time that factors in here - No Quantitative assessment here, but the Qualitative is probably \"TAG turnaround is hard\"\n   * **Buyers - There is still a relatively stable # of deals comp'd between the normal 82%-98% range**\n\n**Overall- Considering that TAG only launched in November of 2023 (\\~2 years), its ability to sell at an average of 89% of PSA's value is a strong metric, and something I would like to see continue and improve moving forward.**\n\n# Let me know what card you want me to do next!! - Currently have the Bubble Mew loaded up for next post.\n\nIf this posts gets some traction, I'll consider posting more and take suggestions for what cards you'd like to see next. (but only if it it has at least 8-10+ TAG sold datapoints).\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "This is a message for those who do breaks. If you are anti-breaks please keep scrolling as this post is not for you. \n\nA PSA for the community to be aware of Swish Breaks. A little over a month ago I bought a break spot with Swish Breaks on Fanatics Live. In the break I  hit a Keon Coleman RPA  /25. A week or so later I received an empty bubble mailer. I reached out to Swish Breaks. They let me know they made an error and sent the card out to the wrong address. They stated they were having the card sent back to them and then they would send to me. I reached out again about a week later and they responded they were still waiting on the card. I reached out again a week after that to get an update and they did not respond. After several days of no response from Swish Breaks I reached out to Fanatics support. They responded quickly and offered me a credit.  I declined the credit as I stated I had no reason to use their app anymore if they were going to allow their sellers to act in bad faith. They then offered to double the initial credit offer (value was more than the card was worth) to which I politely declined again based on the reason I previously stated. In defense of Fanatics Live I will say after years of occasional breaking this is the only issue I have had and they did quickly respond and offer a remedy. To me though, I only break with sellers that operate in good faith and Swish Breaks broke that trust. FL support stated they “reported” Swish Breaks for the incident but I wanted to let everyone in here know they are not a good faith seller. ",

    "text": "Hello! Mods, I hope this post is allowed since the process for earning free food from McDonalds Monopoly can be a bit cumbersome. (Just look at the other threads, there are a ton of confused people in the comments.) Hopefully this will cut down on the number of people asking questions.\n\nNote: I'm not associated with McDonalds, I just spent an hour sifting through the official rules and figured I'd share.\n\n---\n\n**What is this?**\n\n---\n\nMcDonalds has a promotion where they partner with Monopoly to give away tons of prizes such as free food, gift cards, and a handful of grand prizes such as cars, airline miles, etc. The idea is you buy food at McDonalds and receive a code (from a game piece) which can be entered online for a chance at a prize. However, sweepstakes in the United States are required by law to have a free method of entry.\n\nFor most sweepstakes, you can only enter for free once, or some other limited amount of times. For this year's McDonalds contest, you can enter for free **the exact same amount of times** as if you purchased food from McDonalds. That's right. **There's no advantage to purchasing food versus entering for free.** This is because there is a maximum number of game pieces you can redeem each day (10), and you can get 10 game pieces for free each day through the method below.\n\n**Note: This contest is only open to folks in the United States.**\n\n---\n\n**How can I get and redeem free game pieces?**\n\n---\n\n1. First make sure you have downloaded the McDonalds app and made an account. It is required to participate in this promotion.\n2. Go to this link: https://amoe.playatmcd.com/\n3. Enter your email, confirm you are 18 years or older, security verification, and read the rules confirmation. Click Continue to Verification.\n4. Wait 1-15 minutes to receive an email from McDonalds. It's not always an instant email. If you're still waiting after 20 minutes, try entering a different email in the form.\n5. When this email arrives, click on the link in the email and type in the six-digit code from the email. Then enter your name and street address and tap Validate My Address. Finally, tap Submit Game Code Request. *Note: If you get an error in the form, make sure your suffix is chosen (if you have none, you have to choose None from the dropdown).*\n6. After submitting the form McDonalds should send you a new email in 1-15 minutes. It's not always an instant email. \n7. Open the McDonalds app. At the top there should be a Monopoly section with two buttons. Tap on the white button that says \"Register or Play.\"\n8. Tap \"Add Code.\"\n9. Tap \"Add Code Manually\" at the bottom.\n10. Copy/paste or type in a 12-digit code from the email and tap \"Submit Code.\"\n\nNow just sit back and see if you won something.\n\n---\n\n**I didn't win anything :(**\n\n---\n\nDon't fret. **Most people will get nothing.** There is only about a 19% chance you will win a food prize. This breaks down as follows:\n\n- Choice of Apple Pie OR Small Fries (~4% chance)\n- Choice of Vanilla Cone OR Small Fries (3.12%)\n- Choice of Biscuit Breakfast Sandwich (2.63%)\n- Choice of McChicken OR Double Cheeseburger (2.38%)\n- Choice of Small Soft Drink OR Coffee (2.17%)\n- Choice of 4pc McNuggets/Snack Wrap (2.04%)\n- Choice of Small Frappe OR Small Shake OR Small Smoothie (1.47%)\n- Choice of 2 Cookies OR Mini McFlurry (1.02%)\n\nThere is also a less than 1% chance you will win McDonalds points ranging from 1,500 up to 6,000 points.\n\nConversely, there is about an 80% chance you will not earn a food or points prize. Instead, you will most likely receive a Collect to Win game piece. These are the massive prizes likes cars, motorhomes, shopping sprees, etc. You have to collect **multiple** of these game pieces and the odds of doing that are astronomically small (ie. more likely to be struck by lightning). So it's basically the same as receiving nothing, unless you are incredibly lucky.\n\n---\n\n**But wait, there's more!**\n\n---\n\nScroll down and tap on \"Play Now\" under Bonus Play. A free prize is given at a random interval every minute. If you happen to tap at the predetermined time, you will get one of the following:\n\n- One of the food or points prizes listed above\n- A gift card to a variety of stores including Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub, Ulta Beauty, Best Buy, Fanatics, New Era, Lowe's, etc\n- A physical prize from a variety of retailers including Roku, The Woobles, Jeep, Sonic, Pickleball, Susan Alexandra, Samsung, etc\n- A free subscription to a variety of services including Peacock, Everand, etc\n- An experience from a variety of providers such as a music festival, sports game, FIFA World Cup, international destination, etc\n- A cash prize ranging from $50 all the way up to $10,000\n\nNote that the gift cards, physical prizes, subscriptions, experiences, and cash prizes are only available in the Bonus Play section. So it's very important to do the Bonus Play.\n\n---\n\n**I won a prize! :)**\n\n---\n\nCongratulations! If you got a food prize or points, tap on the X in the upper left corner to exit out of the Monopoly game. Then tap on Rewards & Deals in the center button at the bottom of the app. If you got points, these will be in the upper right corner of the app (tap on \"View History\" to see the exact amount). If you got a food prize, tap on \"View All\" and scroll down until you see your prize.\n\nIf you got a non-food prize such as a gift card or cash prize, you'll receive an email with instructions on how to redeem your prize.\n\nBear in mind all prizes may take several minutes, or even a few hours, to process. If you don't see your prize right away come back later. In the meantime, read the \"But wait, there's more!\" section above **since you can do Bonus Play even if you won a prize.**\n\n---\n\n**How do I enter the contest again?**\n\n---\n\nAfter using the first code from your email, repeat steps 7-10 for the second code from your email.\n\nAfter using the second code, repeat steps 2-10 to get more codes. You can submit the form up to 5 times each day, and each email has 2 codes, which means you can get up to 10 codes free each day. A new \"day\" begins at 12:00 AM Eastern Time, 11:00 PM Central Time, 10:00 PM Mountain Time, and 9:00 PM Pacific Time.\n\n**Tip:** You don't have to do steps 2-10 one at a time. You can submit the email form (steps 2-3) five consecutive times to get five codes, then do steps 5-6 consecutively, then steps 7-10 consecutively. This should expedite the process.",

    "text": "I have always been a pretty big eBay buyer, but  I just did a few auctions and eBay is just not what it used to be for graded comics.   First, the inventory doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be.  Second, if anything is good it is often over priced trying to drive you to sellers web age.  Third, if I do find what looks to be a decent auction I always seem to lose as \"second highest bidder\".  This last one happens so often now it has to be something fishy (even though I don't have proof).\n\nI also used to frequent the CGC forum's, inventory also seems scarce there.  Are people just sitting on big books because market is down?\n\nI know about ComicLink, MyComicShop,  and Heritage but  would prefer more eBay style auctions.\n\nI personally hate social media so don't do Instagram, or whatnot.  The later I can't stand you can barely inspect the book before someone buys.  I want good pictures, not someone holding it in front of a camera for 5 seconds telling me what the grade is.  I want a chance to grade it myself.  I just tried FB Marketplace but frankly good stuff is rare where I live.\n\nAm I missing someplace, where did all the eBay buyers/sellers go?  Feels like the online market is splintered and while I hated eBay for fees, it was a pretty safe place for buyers and it was  kind of nice almost everyone/thing was there.",

    "text": "This painting by Frank Fazetta was the top auction sale for the week ending 9/19/25. It is one of his most recognizable and iconic images of Conan the Cimmerian\", according to noted Robert E. Howard historian Mark Finn, who went on to say, \"This scene is from the story 'Rogues in the House' where Conan fights the man-ape Thak.\" \n\n\n\n“Man Ape,\" as it has also come to be known, was completed in 1966 and published as the cover for Conan of the 1967 Lancer/Ace Books reprints, which were immediately a huge hit due in huge part to Frazetta's powerful cover paintings. \n\n\n\nBeginning with this series the artist reinvented fantasy illustration for an entire generation. This imagery defined the character and was instrumental in making the Conan resurgence of the late 1960s a mass market success, which ultimately led to the Marvel Comics book series and the later series of feature films. \n\n\n\nThe painting was created in oil on a 16\" x 20\" canvas wrapped board. Open-front framed to 22.5\" x 26.5\". The piece is signed and noted \"(c) 74\" in the mid-to-lower left. The reverse side of the board is dated \"Nov. 1967\", which looks to be a production notation from a publisher. The painting is in Excellent condition, reflecting the fact that it has remained with the artist and his family since its creation.\n\n  \n\n\nMan Ape, was subsequently frequently reproduced as a poster as well as on comic book covers",

    "text": "I really appreciate the positive response to my posts on sourcing vintage deals on eBay! My first post was on [MiUSA shirts](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1n8rf9a/vintage_deals_on_ebay_miusa_shirt_recs_for_the/) and the second was on [good value sweaters](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1nfidou/vintage_deals_on_ebay_sweaters_for_the_fall_part_1/). See below for Part 2 of the sweater series.\n\nBefore diving into the sweater picks, I’m excited to share that I’ve created a [new subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageMenswearDeals/) 100% focused on this kind of stuff!\n\n**New Sub:** r/VintageMenswearDeals\n\nIf you’ve enjoyed these posts so far, please check out r/VintageMenswearDeals. I’ve never created or moderated a subreddit before, so this is all still very much a work in progress. But the current plan is to do something like the following:\n\n* **Cross-Posts**\n   * Same as the roundups I’ll still be putting up on r/frugalmalefashion, but with additional links to curated lists of items on eBay that I thought looked pretty good.\n   * My current goal is to put up one of these round-up posts every week or so, depending on interest level and how things go.\n   * I’ve got tons of ideas for potential posts, but please do let me know if there’s anything you’d specifically like to see covered!\n* **Deep Dives**\n   * Lots more info on some of the specific pieces that were covered in the round-up posts, including additional history, alternate options, and some of the more collectible/pricey versions of the item.\n   * [Deep dives so far:](https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageMenswearDeals/) 1. Vintage Woolrich Shirts, 2. Rugby Shirts\n   * More to come, with a plan to put up about one of these per week as well.\n* **Brand Overviews**\n   * History & details for brands that provide good value when sourcing vintage.\n   * I’ll be putting up one on these soon on LL Bean, I'm just waiting on some old LL Bean photo books to arrive first!\n   * And expect posts in the future on brands like Eddie Bauer, Pendleton, Polo Ralph Lauren, Woolrich, Lands’ End, Brooks Brothers, defunct workwear brands, 70s mountaineering brands, and more. Suggestions welcome!\n* **Strategy & Advice**\n   * I haven’t put up anything up in this category so far, but expect to see posts about how to best use eBay searches & filters, how to clean & store vintage clothing, how to shop in-person at thrift stores & vintage shops, etc.\n* **Questions & Answers**\n   * Have a category you want to know more about? Got a question about a brand or an item? Make a recent purchase you want to share? Please create a post on the sub!\n   * I’ll do my best to get the discussion started on the question being asked, but would love to see others chime in with additional thoughts.\n   * I’m currently planning to leave post creation totally open to everyone, rather than doing weekly Q&A posts or anything like that. \n\nThanks again for all the interest. Now on to the sweaters!\n\n**Pick** \\#**1: Shetland Sweaters**\n\nI didn’t own a ton of clothes growing up, and my closet was mostly hand me downs from my older brothers until I outgrew them. But at some point in late middle school my parents got me this green crewneck sweater from J.Crew. It had a fuzzy texture and a deep, rich color. And I wore it all the time. Sometimes as an outermost layer on those crisp fall days. Or as a warm insulating layer under a jacket in the winter. It was even nice enough to wear to family gatherings on holidays and the like. Unfortunately at some point in high school the sweater ended up getting mixed in with the regular laundry. After that hot wash and dry it was never the same again, and I probably gave it away in college after never wearing it much anymore. Such is life.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9il79zzd55qf1.png?width=308&format=png&auto=webp&s=59e6b990728499734f2ceaf5229057089a8eb98e\n\nIt was only until I started paying attention to clothing/menswear/fashion that I understood what I’d been wearing: a fuzzy Shetland-style sweater, which Derek Guy has aptly called [“The Most Versatile Sweater”](https://putthison.com/the-most-versatile-sweater/).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nszpgqig55qf1.png?width=2094&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd2d23cd3651326feb422943287b4447863f0c7\n\nSo what is a Shetland sweater? “True” Shetland sweaters are made with something like the following formula: 1. Wool from the Shetland breed of sheep, 2. Sheep raised in the Shetland Isles off the coast of Scotland, 3. Wool spun into yarn in Scotland, 4. Yarn knitted into a sweater in Scotland.\n\nBut even sweaters that deviate from this formula are often called “Shetlands” or “Shetland-style”, as long as they have a similar look to the classic Scottish Shetland sweaters. Shetland sweaters are generally on the thinner side of what you might call “medium weight” for a sweater. Most are made from two strands of yarn plied together (2-ply), though you will sometimes see very thin 1-ply versions or thicker 4-ply versions. (Note: There’s actually a lot more to a sweater’s “heaviness” than just the ply of the yarn. Do some searching on yarn twist, knit tightness/looseness, and the various ways to measure the linear weight of yarn and you’ll start to realize how complicated clothing production can get…)\n\nWhatever the weight, Shetland wool has a lovely texture and takes color really well. They are definitely scratchier than sweaters made with the finer fibers of merino wool or cashmere, so many people prefer to wear a long sleeve tee or button-up shirt under them. Shetlands are often brushed as a finishing step, making them softer and giving them an even fuzzier/shaggier texture, such as in J Press’ classic [Shaggy Dogs](https://jpressonline.com/collections/shaggy-dog). They can come in a bunch of different styles (v-neck, cardigan, turtleneck, etc.), though the classic version is a very simple crewneck.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/50vasz1m55qf1.png?width=2112&format=png&auto=webp&s=37122e5103be28cf392753491406f47936e83f48\n\nFor more details, history, and styling advice, definitely check out that [Derek Guy post](https://putthison.com/the-most-versatile-sweater/) for an awesome overview, plus his additional coverage [here](https://www.putthison.com/a-basic-guide-to-useful-knitwear/), [here](https://www.putthison.com/its-on-sale-shetland-sweaters/), and [here](https://putthison.com/shetland-sweaters-for-fall-there-was-some/). Permanent Style has an excellent two part deep dive on Shetlands [here](https://www.permanentstyle.com/2021/12/the-guide-to-shetland-sweaters-part-one.html) & [here](https://www.permanentstyle.com/2021/12/the-guide-to-shetland-sweaters-part-one.html). Bruce Boyer wrote about Shetlands for Drake’s [here](https://us.drakes.com/blogs/news/bruce-boyer-drakes-brushed-shetland-crewneck-jumper). There are also some good Reddit threads you can search for, including on [MaleFashionAdvice](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/search/?q=shetland) & [NavyBlazer](https://www.reddit.com/r/NavyBlazer/search/?q=shetland). (I was hoping there was a 300+ page Styleforum thread on Shetlands like they have for [“Cashmere Sweater Hierarchy”,](https://www.styleforum.net/threads/cashmere-sweater-hierarchy.218492/) but alas the Shetland discussion on StyleForum is a bit more spread out…)\n\n**Now For Some Bad News**\n\nTrue Scottish Shetland sweaters have become quite expensive. O’Connell’s shetlands are [$225](https://oconnellsclothing.com/oconnells-essentials/shetland-sweaters.html). J Press’ Shaggy Dogs are [$275](https://jpressonline.com/collections/shaggy-dog). The ones from Drake’s are [$345](https://us.drakes.com/collections/shetland-jumpers). Howlin’s Birth of the Cool is [over $200](https://morrison.be/collections/birth-of-the-cool-1). Etc, etc.\n\nThere used to be a few sources to be able to buy sweaters directly from Scotland for a delivered price to the US of $120-140 or so (e.g. [Harley/Bosie](https://bosie.co/collections/mens-shetland-lambswool-sweaters-and-cardigans), [Jamieson’s](https://www.jamiesonsknitwear.co.uk), & [Genuine Scottish Knits](https://www.genuinescottishknits.com)). But shipping costs, tariffs, and the end of de minimus have messed that all up. Delivered prices are definitely higher now, if they’re even willing to ship to you at all.\n\nSaying that, you can still find some deals on NWT Shetland sweaters for $100-120 in spring & summer if you’re willing to be patient and not be as picky on color. I’d specifically recommend looking for Jamieson’s, Harley/Bosie, & Howlin’ on clearance, or really any NWT auctions/deals on eBay for the larger set of quality brands. Harley/Bosie & Howlin’ are my personal favorites (w/ the Howlin’ ones in fact being made by Harley), so I’ve grabbed a few for $90-110 when they’ve popped up. But other makers may fit better for your body since they all vary a bit in dimension/shape.\n\nSo what’s the frugal man to do when needing a sweater very soon? More on vintage/used options below, but for buying new, there are two decent options that are frequently <$75, though neither of them are “true” Shetland sweaters from Scotland.\n\n*Option 1: Spier & Mackay*\n\nSpier & Mackay sells “Shetland Crewnecks” which last year were $88 MSRP for the regular version or [$98 MSRP](https://us.spierandmackay.com/product/heathered-brown-brushed-shetland-crewneck-10273-bsh-cnk) for the brushed. (This year’s versions haven’t been released yet, so TBD on pricing.) Sweaters from Spier regularly go on sale for 20-30% off in-season and as much as 50% off out of season. I’ve [recommended these sweaters before](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1imh3vg/spier_mackay_shetland_crewneck_sweaters_58_for/), and have liked the ones I’ve owned well enough.\n\nBut there are two caveats:\n\n1. It’s not clear if Spier is actually using true Shetland wool. The exact wording used on the site is a bit inconclusive and inconsistent on the source of the wool. And they are knitted in China from what I recall.\n2. The construction is a “cut and sew” style, where sections of knit fabric are cut apart and then sewn together using thread. This is in contrast to a sweater being a) “fully fashioned”, where pieces are knit together using the same yarn as the sweater itself, resulting in a minimal seam, or b) “seamless”, where either the main body or even the whole garment itself is knit as a single piece. Fully fashioned and seamless sweaters are more elegant, but they also more expensive to manufacture. Spier’s sweaters hit a nice price point, but the manufacturing method they use makes the details of the sweater a bit more chunky and less refined than the more expensive methods. Saying that, I think the Spier ones are plenty good for the price, particularly if you want to try out the style and wait until they are on full clearance / 50% off.\n\n*Option 2: J.Crew*\n\nThe other NWT option I’ve picked up in the past few years are the [“Brushed Wool Crewneck”](https://www.jcrew.com/p/mens/categories/clothing/sweaters/crewneck/brushed-wool-crewneck-sweater/BI848) sweaters from J.Crew. (These are also almost certainly the modern version of the J.Crew sweater that my parents got for me back in the 90s.) The J.Crew ones are also decent, though you certainly shouldn’t buy them at the \\~$140 MSRP. I got mine in Dec 2023 for <$60, so you’ll definitely want to play the typical 40-60% off J.Crew MSRP game. They don’t seem to have released this year’s versions yet, but I do expect there will be a price increase given everything that’s been going on.\n\n**Now For Some Even Worse News!**\n\nUnlike with some of the items that I’ve covered previously in this series, there doesn’t appear to be anything like the following available on eBay for Shetland sweaters:\n\n* Large supply (i.e. dozens to hundreds of examples in each size)\n* Made in Scotland\n* Cheaper than buying the Spier or J.Crew versions\n\nI expect that “Shetland” is simply a popular enough search term that the cheap ones are grabbed up quickly, thus keeping supply pretty low and prices pretty high. So you’ll have to do a bit of searching, browsing, and hunting across different brands and eras to find a sweater that might work for you.\n\nSaying all that, I do have a suggestion for some brands that have somewhat decent supply and typically sell in the $40-60 range:\n\n1. Brooks Brothers (Made In Scotland)\n2. Land’s End (Made in Scotland)\n3. Pendleton (Made in USA)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x5mqhmlr55qf1.png?width=2068&format=png&auto=webp&s=006d08dbc5a9845a3821db301f820c85815e40b6\n\nHere are two searches that will find these three brands:\n\n* [Using the Scotland/USA Country Filters](https://www.ebay.com/sch/11484/i.html?_oaa=1&_dcat=11484&_fsrp=1&rt=nc&_from=R40&_nkw=(shetland%2C+brushed%2C+brush%2C+fuzz%2C+fuzzy%2C+shag%2C+shaggy%2C+texture%2C+textured%2C+donegal)+(brooks+brothers%2C+brook%27s+brothers%2C+brook+brother%2C+brooks+brother%2C+brook+brothers%2C+brooks+brother%27s%2C+brook%27s+brother%27s%2C+land+end%2C+lands%27+end%2C+land%27s+end%2C+lands+end%2C+pendleton%2C+pendelton)&_sacat=11484&Material=Alpaca%7CAngora%7CCashmere%7C!%7CWool%7CMohair&LH_TitleDesc=1&LH_PrefLoc=1&Country%252FRegion%2520of%2520Manufacture=United%2520States%7CUnited%2520Kingdom&Sleeve%2520Length=Long%2520Sleeve%7C!)\n* [Searching for Scotland or USA in the Title/Description](https://www.ebay.com/sch/11484/i.html?_dcat=11484&_fsrp=1&rt=nc&_from=R40&_nkw=(shetland%2C+brushed%2C+brush%2C+fuzz%2C+fuzzy%2C+shag%2C+shaggy%2C+texture%2C+textured%2C+donegal)+(brooks+brothers%2C+brook%27s+brothers%2C+brooks+brother%27s%2C+brook%27s+brother%27s%2C+land+end%2C+lands%27+end%2C+land%27s+end%2C+lands+end%2C+pendleton%2C+pendelton)+(uk%2C+united+kingdom%2C+scotland%2C+scottish%2C+scotch%2C+usa%2C+miusa)&_sacat=11484&Material=Wool%7C!%7CAnimal%2520Hair%7CAngora%7CCashmere%7CAlpaca%7CMohair&Style=Pullover%7C!&Country%252FRegion%2520of%2520Manufacture=United%2520Kingdom%7CUnited%2520States%7C!&LH_PrefLoc=1&LH_TitleDesc=1&Brand=Brooks%2520Brothers%7CLands%2527%2520End%7CPendleton%7C!%7CShetland%7CUnbranded)\n\nI’ve also curated a selection of options as part of the version of this post over on r/VintageMenswearDeals, including some additional options I found beyond just the brands above.\n\nFinal suggestion: I recommend searching from time to time for the higher end brands such as Jamieson’s, Harley/Bosie, J Press, O’Connell’s, etc. Good deals on these brands do pop up from time to time, but you’ll typically have to move quickly to grab one. Try [this search](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_dcat=11484&_fsrp=1&Country%252FRegion%2520of%2520Manufacture=United%2520Kingdom%7CUnited%2520States%7C!%7CIreland%7CItaly&rt=nc&_from=R40&LH_TitleDesc=1&LH_PrefLoc=1&_nkw=(shetland%2C+brushed%2C+brush%2C+fuzz%2C+fuzzy%2C+shag%2C+shaggy%2C+texture%2C+textured%2C+donegal)+(drake%27s%2C+drakes%2C+oconnells%2C+o%27connell%27s%2C+o%27connell%2C+o%27connell%2C+jpress%2C+j+press%2C+j.press%2C+howlin%2C+harley%2C+bosie%2C+jamieson%2C+jamiesons%2C+jamieson%27s%2C+anderson+sheppard%2C+crabtree%2C+laurence+smith%2C+odie%2C+%22shaggy+dog%22)&_sacat=11484&_udhi=200&Sleeve%2520Length=Long%2520Sleeve%7C!&Material=Alpaca%7CCashmere%7CMohair%7CWool%7C!) for a starting point.\n\n**Pick 2: LL Bean Cotton Sweaters**\n\nI was originally planning to include a section on vintage Fair Isle sweaters as part of this post. But two things changed that plan:\n\n1. It turns out there are a lot of really ugly Fair Isle sweaters on eBay! The nicer looking ones (e.g. similar to what [Bosie/Harley](https://bosie.co/collections/mens-fair-isle-scottish-knitwear) currently sells) are unfortunately rather few and far between. I’ll still try to cover Fair Isle (and similar) sweaters at a later point, but it’s going to take a bit more research and curation to be useful.\n2. The L.L. Bean cotton henley sweater that I picked up while researching the [previous sweater post](https://www.reddit.com/r/frugalmalefashion/comments/1nfidou/vintage_deals_on_ebay_sweaters_for_the_fall_part_1/) finally arrived, and I really, really like this thing. It’s got a nice medium tight knit, the detailing is really cool, and the quality for the \\~$30 version I got is basically like new. I’m not in general a huge fan of cotton sweaters given that many don’t hold their shape very well. But that vintage L.L. Bean cotton henley sweater is a perfect transitional sweater for these early fall days. I’ll be wearing it a ton over the next two months for sure.\n\nSo I did some searching to see if there were similar Made In USA cotton sweaters that I could recommend. And I was happy to find that there are a few options, once again from L.L. Bean.\n\nIn my opinion, the best looking of the bunch are the crewneck versions with a raglan/saddle shoulder and a vertical rib texture. I’m not sure whether the knitting is [a half-fisherman or a Shaker-knit](https://dieworkwear.com/2021/01/14/a-soft-history-of-american-radicals-revolutionaries-and-christians/), but either way I think it looks excellent. The overall design reminds me of [J.Crew’s](https://www.jcrew.com/m/mens/categories/clothing/sweaters/pullover/MP443) “Heritage cotton crewneck sweater”. The J.Crew crewneck is currently on sale for 50% off the $98 MSRP, though in previous years the MSRP was $89 and you could easily grab them on sale for <$40. The J.Crew ones are totally fine at that price point, but you should be able to grab the L.L Bean ones for even cheaper, just $20-40 based on recent eBay sale comps.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qkfq89hx55qf1.png?width=2134&format=png&auto=webp&s=21727c819d02c8a94a5c02f6aa3a8b440556e38c\n\nThere are also MiUSA L.L. Bean cotton sweaters in a few additional styles as well, including v-neck, striped, diamond-textured, zipper (both full and half zip), and even some really nice looking versions that are clearly inspired by [Guernsey/Gansey fisherman sweaters](https://x.com/dieworkwear/status/1725631316505538585).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yjlkst8065qf1.png?width=2152&format=png&auto=webp&s=f34088c1e184cf454d90f69e0725626399c4eaca\n\nThe various sweaters pictured above are actually a bit difficult to search for on eBay since the henley/button ones are super common and make up roughly half of the vintage MiUSA inventory for L.L. Bean sweaters. However, by using the “minus” operator in eBay search (i.e. -henley -button) and a bunch of filters you can start to narrow things down. Here are two searches to get started:\n\n* [Using the MiUSA Filter](https://www.ebay.com/sch/11484/i.html?_dcat=11484&_fsrp=1&rt=nc&_from=R40&_nkw=bean+-henley+-button&_sacat=11484&LH_TitleDesc=1&LH_PrefLoc=1&LH_ItemCondition=3000&Brand=L%252EL%252E%2520Bean&Country%252FRegion%2520of%2520Manufacture=United%2520States&Material=!%7CCotton%7CCotton%2520Blend&Style=Cardigan%7CFull%2520Zip%7CPullover%7CVest%7C!)\n* [Searching for USA or MiUSA in the Title/Description](https://www.ebay.com/sch/11484/i.html?_dcat=11484&_fsrp=1&rt=nc&_from=R40&_nkw=bean+-henley+-button+(usa%2C+miusa)&_sacat=11484&LH_TitleDesc=1&LH_PrefLoc=1&LH_ItemCondition=3000&Country%252FRegion%2520of%2520Manufacture=United%2520States%7C!&Sleeve%2520Length=Long%2520Sleeve%7C!&Brand=L%252EL%252E%2520Bean&Material=Cotton%7CCotton%2520Blend%7C!)\n\nI’ve also put up a selection of different good looking options as part of the version of this post on the [new sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/VintageMenswearDeals/).\n\nCheers!",

The entire market appears to be flooded with these, Eid Mar Auctions for example posts one every week or so. However, the single biggest pusher of these coins, many of which are high grade, is Heritage Auctions. Here are the numbers at Heritage roughly:\n\nSold in 2025 so far: 70+ Darics  \nStill for Sale in Upcoming Auctions in 2025: 55+ Darics  \nTotal Darics SOLD to-date by Heritage from 1999-2025: 740 Darics\n\nFolks . . . this much gold doesn't trade hands without someone knowing something. 110+ Darics in a single calendar year from Heritage alone and another 80+ I've seen floating around with sellers and at auction houses brings us to something like 200+ sold or will be sold in 2025 alone. That's not vaguely normal. \n\nA hoarde was found? Buddy how big a hoarde are we talking? Unless a small city state's treasury was unearthed, those numbers don't add up. Praying that this isn't a sure shot sign of museum looting. \n\n  \n",

These coins were also struck with the pattern “engraved tailfeathers” reverse design which is shared with the coveted “Cheerios” variety of Sacagawea Dollar. This special reverse design was used on only the very first coins struck in the series and was quickly modified to a less detailed design shortly after production began.\n\nOnly the 12 best strikes were selected for flight aboard Space Shuttle Columbia, and the remaining 27 Sacagawea coins were destroyed. Of the 12 survivors in 22-karat gold, only seven will be available for public ownership, and these will be presented exclusively in the Stack’s Bowers Galleries sale. The United States Mint has confirmed that the remaining five coins will be archived in their heritage collection and permanently out of reach for collectors. \n\nHere’s one of the coveted “Cheerios” variety.

    "text": "Just wanted to share my negative experience with \"Break'n Bad\" on fanatics live as an FYI to others. Since July I have spent over $925 with that shop purchasing various online cards breaks including one where I paid a little over $37 for a Topps Chrome Jumbo pack. I received the package on time but it only contained cards pulled from other orders I placed with them and no Jumbo Pack (I did receive a second Jumbo Pack I bought in a separate purchase/shipment just fine the same week). I messaged them through the fanatics site, got a couple replies including \"our shipping team may have just missed including that pack\", but its now been a week with no follow-up or resolution from them. I just filed a complaint with Fanatics, hoping they can help get this resolved, but its a let down to spend that much money with someone only to end up getting ignored when things go wrong. That's not the customer service someone would expect when a company drops the ball. Until this point, my experience with them was otherwise positive, but when someone doesn't fix their mistake that's a deal breaker for me, so I will not be purchasing again from them and will likely stop the whole site altogether, if fanatics can't make it right.\n\nUpdate 9/16/25: I filed a claim with Fanatics-live as previously stated (who responded very quickly) and received an update from the shop shortly thereafter (not sure if it was cause-and-effect or not). Just got a replacement jumbo pack from the shop, so they did ultimately make good on their end. Overall, its good to see both the shop and fanatics provide resolution, but it did unfortunately result in having to jump through several extra hoops on my side.",

    "text": "Canada was once a body. Strong, whole, pumping its own blood.\n\nNow it’s an organ farm. Corporations attach the pumps by controlling where money, opportunity, and resources flow, and the government manages the tubes, enforcing rules, allocations, and legal cover. Immigration is the transfusion line keeping the system alive for them and not us. Housing, schools, jobs, culture, even streets are all quietly redirected through this network.\n\nThe body is already cut down to maybe 54% legacy stock. Of that, 70% are under hypnosis, sedated by a state-run news system legally allowed to lie to citizens since before COVID. That leaves just 17% awake, the immune system barely holding on, shrinking every year, while every corner of the body is replaced cell by cell.\n\nA few creeps breaking laws? Just the surface. The deeper layer is a network running under protection. Housing flipped into party houses, delivery apps, rentals, jobs, and cultural spaces. All hush-hush, quietly redirected. Vehicles everywhere with AK-47s and Khalistan symbols hang from mirrors, visible through windshields. Pre-assigned routes on apps, streets, schools, and jobs flow to newcomers. Heritage, youth futures, and opportunities vanish before your eyes.\n\nThis is the greatest operation ever done to trick the masses, convincing a majority to work against itself. Boomers cheer “build baby, build,” handing over houses and influence, unaware newcomers are reproducing rapidly, filling grocery carts, buying homes and cars, and building opportunities while legacy youth freeze out. Population growth runs faster than Africa or India.\n\nIt mirrors the late 1800s: orphan trains, immigrant farms, Europe colonizing North America. Now it’s over us, using our systems, laws, and minds against us. For newcomers, life is a Disney Land; for us, it’s the amusement park built on what used to be ours.\n\nEvery layer is coordinated: corporate pumps flow into housing, gig economy pipelines, and credit systems; government tubes regulate approvals, allocations, and policy enforcement. Cultural spaces, schools, and even grocery aisles are routed through this system to favor newcomers. All of it not a random phase or pattern, this all has been pre-assigned, engineered, and protected at every junction.\n\nEvery ‘affordable’ unit is already assigned to someone else before it even hits the market, and your city’s blood flows elsewhere before you even know it. Banks pre-approve newcomers instantly, while legacy citizens face layers of denial, paperwork, and delays. LMIA approvals and TFW pipelines slot newcomers into key positions before locals. Every street, school, and city service is pre-assigned in advance to favor newcomers. While local kids and families quietly routed out. Housing, jobs, credit, and cultural spaces all flow through the system to newcomers first. Population growth among newcomers now outpaces Africa and India combined, silently reshaping neighborhoods, economies, and entire cultural rhythms. Menus, festivals, sports, and school programs are subtly reassigned. The culture of your streets is now flowing somewhere else.\n\nSystems favor them: credit access, mortgages, first-time buyer programs, municipal allocations, LMIA, TFW, student visas. Apps, gig economy pipelines, corporate staffing, and city infrastructure slot newcomers before locals. Culture subtly shifts like grocery aisles, menus, schools, sports, festivals, parades now become pre-assigned to newcomers.\n\nWhy can newcomers buy a house four to one, while the national-born pays four times what it’s worth? Every key handed over is a piece of your body signed away. Streets, schools, neighborhoods, and futures being auctioned off in real time.\n\nThis is systemic, deliberate. Only the 17% still aware can stop the collapse; if they fail, the body dies. Every year, the fraction shrinks, smothered by controlled opposition, rabbit holes, and diversion campaigns. By 2030, visible culture, leadership, and opportunity may be fully controlled by newcomers.\n\nForget managers. The body survives only if defenders act. Observe the flow of the pumps and tubes. Record where influence travels, adapt to protect your streets and schools, fight back where the system diverts opportunity, and build networks to reclaim culture and resources. The blood of the nation, the heritage, youth, opportunity all depends on the 17% who see the truth.\n\nDo you see it?",

Some fun chases, but possible \"scarcity overload?\"\n\nThe overall landscape for retail Chrome this year does not look good for value. If you must purchase retail, I recommend Fanatics Megas if at all possible.\n\n1. Autos are seeded at 1:5 boxes compared to 1:9.5 boxes in regular mega & 1:7.5 boxes blasters.\n2. Production of Fanatics Mega is about 9% that of reg megas. (210k pks vs 2.4m pks)\n3. Fanatics Megas contain 10 Topps Refractors (PR \\~1000ea), vs 10 X-Fractors in reg megas (PR \\~12k ea). So they should hold better value. However this may be based too much on logic as there are a couple things working against the \"Topps Refractors\" holding solid value-\n\na) Consumers must realize the scarcity in relation to other unnumbered refractors and unfortunately there are a number of other \"logo-style refractors\" (both Chrome and paper versions) with varying rarities they can easily be lumped in with. Personally, I have to look at my extensive notes to remind myself of the differences on these so how is the average consumer supposed to know?\n\nb) If you have tried searching ebay for these \"Topps refractors\", you know it's super wonky and there's no good way to do so. I feel if Topps could have come up with a catchier name or style for these, it would help mightily, but they seem destined to get lost in the mix even though they are quite short printed.\n\n4) Fanatics Megas are the only format with a chance at Authentics Redemptions, which touts a nice checklist of subjects, but probably still does not justify the $80 premium price point.\n\nComparing 2025 Topps Chrome base production to prior years (does not include base from Logofractor boxes):  \n2025 (300 card set): 120,682  \n2024 (300 cards): 122,064  \n2023 (220 cards): 154,491  \n2022 (220 cards): 176,635  \n2021 (220 cards): 136,554  \n2020 (200 cards): 106,664\n\nWhen figuring print runs, I found it peculiar that base print runs (prior to adding Logofractor) were nearly identical for 2025 & 2024. Yet it seems like numbered cards and quality hits are so much tougher in 2025.\n\nSo I added up all unnumbered refractors + base inserts + all inserts with a print run of 500+ (so this includes case hits like Ultraviolet & Fanatical), for both 2025 Chrome & 2024 Chrome as increasing these can greatly affect production numbers without adding to base print runs.\n\n2025- 24.45m cards  \n2024- 17.95m cards  \nYOY diff- +6.5 million cards, or +36.2%\n\nThis is equivalent to 1.625m extra hobby packs (or 1.08m extra Mega packs) worth of extra minor parallels and inserts MORE THAN LAST YEAR. This is where the true bloat comes from and why I believe 2025 Topps Chrome is one of the worst Chrome releases in quite some time, even more so than the lackluster rookie class. \n\nTo break that down further, here are the print run increases of the most common unnumbered parallels:\n\nRefractor  \n2025: 15,670  \n2024: 12,961  \n\\+20.9%  \n  \nX-Fractors  \n2025: 11,623  \n2024: 6,868  \n\\+69.2%  \n  \nPrism Refractors  \n2025: 5,567  \n2024: 6,727  \n\\-17.2%  \n  \nRaywave  \n2025: 14,733  \n2024: 3,758  \n\\+292%  \n  \nSepia  \n2025: 12,409  \n2024: 5,752  \n\\+115.7%\n\nOverall production is only up about 11% (61.83m cards in 2025 vs 55.72m cards in 2024), but that's comprised almost entirely of unnumbered parallels. This is why the format with by far the biggest production increase is the Mega Box (+83.8% YOY when adding in Fanatics Megas). Mega boxes average 16.5 parallels/box, second only to Jumbos at 21/box. To compare, Hobby only has 8.66 parallels/box and Value Boxes average 11.25 parallel/box.\n\nMoral of the story- do not be duped by the \"loaded feel\" of blasters & megas because they have \"sooo many parallels bro\". Those parallels are dog shit.",

    "text": "**Bryn Shander**\n\n**Friendliness**: +++\n\n**Services**: +++\n\n**Comfort**: +++\n\n**Population**. 1,200 (70% Human, 15% Dwarf, 10% Orc or Half-Orc, 5% Other).\n\n**Leaders**. Speaker Duvessa Shane speaks for the townsfolk. Though relatively young, Duvessa is the head of the Council of Speakers. Sheriff Markham Southwell commands the militia.\n\n**Militia**. Bryn Shander can muster up to 250 soldiers and 20 veterans.\n\n**Exports**. Furs, Iron, Scrimshaw\n\n**Imports**. Dye, fruits, herbs, hard woods, spices, textiles, wine.\n\n**Heraldry**. A gold circle on a white field, with a horizontal blue band extending to the left under the circle, and a flaring blue triangle opening away from the circle on the right. The gold circle represents treasure found in the wake of local floods, the blue band is the Shaengarne River, the blue triangle is Maer Dualdon, and the white field represents snow.\n\n**Sacrifice to Auril**. Humanoid.\n\n**Rivalries**. None.\n\n**Government Buildings**\n\n**The Armory**. The town armory is situated just off the central square. Only the town speaker and the sheriff have keys to this building, which stores arms for the militia.\n\n**The Bathhouses**. The renowned bathhouse of Bryn Shander, built around a natural hot spring that bubbles up beneath the city. The establishment is split into two sections. The public baths are a bustling, communal space where locals and travelers alike soak in the mineral-rich waters. The air is thick with steam and the low murmur of conversations, making it an excellent place to gather rumors. Tucked away on the second floor are the private chambers, reserved for the wealthy. These rooms are well decorated with tapestries depicting scenes from myth and legend and offer a level of privacy that few can afford.\n\nThe city official in charge is a man from the far-flung nation of Wa named Ja Sang. Currently frantic, as a series of strange occurrences have been plaguing the bathhouse. The waters in the private baths have turned an unnerving, icy cold, while the public baths remain steaming hot. Worse, the key to the main spring's control valve has gone missing. The culprit is a surprisingly intelligent Water Weird, angered by the disturbance of its natural spring and seeking to reclaim it by plunging the private baths into a frigid state and making off with the key. \n\n**Council Hall**. Located near the southwest gate, the council hall is a nondescript warehouse where the speakers of Ten-Towns engage in discussions about matters that concern their communities. When no meetings are in session, the building stands empty. In the event of a crisis that affects the other settlements of Ten-Towns, the council hall can be converted into a shelter for refugees with the help of the half-orc Minister Savitch.\n\n**The Speaker’s Palace**. The Speaker's Palace is the private residence of the town speaker. The \"palace\" part of its name is an overstatement, compared to such buildings elsewhere in the world. Yet, fashioned by dwarves out of cut stone, with a pitched slate roof and a colonnade in front, the palace is so out of place among the rough wood dwellings in Bryn Shander that it looks as if it had been magically transported here from some other region of Faerûn.\n\nThe current elected speaker, Duvessa Shane, is the daughter of a trader from Waterdeep who settled in Bryn Shander after she fell in love with a local tavern server. Duvessa inherited her mother's talent for negotiation and her father's charm, and she can argue and debate for hours without tiring. Others might bristle at her temerity, but she usually gets what she wants.\n\n**Town Hall**. Bryn Shander's town hall is the largest building that borders the central square. It is reserved for community feasts and gatherings on various holy days and other notable events. The hall can also accommodate refugees from neighboring settlements in times of emergency.\n\nIn the back of the hall is a short flight of stone steps that lead down to a sunken cellar with walls of frozen, hard-packed earth. The cellar has been converted into a sheriff's office and an adjoining jail cell. The sheriff, Markham Southwell, spends little time here, and the jail cell is usually unoccupied. When troublemakers need to be locked up, two deputies are assigned to watch over them. Sheriff Southwell carries the key to the cell door, which can be picked open with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. If the guards need to get into the cell for some reason, one of them leaves to fetch the sheriff while the other waits.\n\n**The Walls**. The town has three sets of 15-foot-high hinged wooden gates, dubbed the North Gate, the East Gate, and the Southwest Gate. These gates can be barred from the inside with heavy, iron-banded hardwood beams. Barred gates have AC 15, 200 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, and immunity to psychic and poison damage. Forcing open a set of barred gates requires a successful DC 28 Strength check.\n\nTwo 30-foot-tall cylindrical stone towers flank each gate and watch over one of the trails that lead to and from the town. The trail from the North Gate travels two miles north to the village of Targos on the frozen shore of a lake called Maer Dualdon. The trail leading east, called the Eastway, stretches roughly thirteen miles to the town of Easthaven on the shore of Lac Dinneshere. The southwest route, known as the Caravan Trail, is called the Ten Trail where it passes through the Spine of the World. This trail is the safest way to the lands south of the mountains, but it is nigh impassable in the winter.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the gates of Bryn Shander stand open, and the guards assigned to the gatehouses say and do nothing as people come and go. When Bryn Shander is threatened, however, the guards close and bar the gates, refusing to open them unless ordered to do so by the sheriff or the speaker. There are four guards at each gate at any given time. Another eight guards are on patrol, moving between the stone watchtowers along the wall. Most of the guards are human, with a sprinkling of shield dwarves, half-orcs, and other races.\n\nA sheriff's deputy named Augrek Brighthelm (see appendix D) often stands watch at the southwest gate. She delights in greeting first-time visitors to town. In fact, she has a well-rehearsed speech that makes some of the other guards at the gate roll their eyes: \"Well met, travelers! Keep yer fingers and extremities under wraps, lest Auril bite them off! Mind yer tempers, and you'll be most welcome here! Brought goods to sell? The market lies straight ahead. Craving a warm drink? May I recommend a drop of Firebeard's Firebrandy, sold only at Kelvin's Comfort, located on yer right as you enter the market square!\" (If the characters arrive at a different gate, you can relocate Augrek to that gate.)\n\n**Shops**\n\n**Blackiron Blades**. This small smithy stands just north of the town square and is marketed as a one-stop shop for adventurers and other travelers in the region. Rather than attempting to compete with the weapons from Kelvin's Cairn, the smith, Garn, makes his living by manufacturing the cheapest blades in Ten-Towns. His sister, Elza runs the shop (both secret doppelgängers). Elza has expanded the business in recent years by offering a selection of adventuring supplies—fur cloaks, leather gloves and boots, ice picks, snowshoes, and other survival gear. While a Blackiron weapon and armor typically sells for half the price, Elza marks up other goods by 50 percent to keep the business profitable. Most of the town's veteran sellswords disdain Garn's smithcraft, and jokes told about hapless newcomers to Icewind Dale often end with the line \"... an' 'e was carryin' a Blackiron blade, to boot!\"\n\n**Bryn Shander Stables**. These stables stand against the outer wall. Horses, ponies, mules, axe beaks, and sled dogs along with their gear can be bought or quartered here and fed for 1 sp per night by proprietor Wulf Hedgewin. \n\n**Gilded Pawn Curios**. This cramped and musty shop on the edge of town is overflowing with oddities, from chipped porcelain figurines to taxidermied goblins. The owner, a human named Vex, is as greasy as his long hair, with a smile that's as fake as most of the \"antique\" items he peddles. He's always trying to convince people that his less then priceless trinkets are worth a fortune, often regaling them with elaborate and entirely made-up backstories for each item. The more desperate a customer seems, the more Vex's prices inflate.\n\n**Market Square**. The marketplace is a roughly circular space in the center of town where local and foreign traders sell their wares including most adventuring gear. Tents and covered wagons provide some shelter against the cold wind, but not much. In a few places, campfires with people huddled around them crackle and smoke.\n\nOne heavily bundled figure commonly seen loitering about the market square is a haggard, homeless young woman named Beldora. She wears boots that are much too big for her feet, and thick gloves made from walrus hide. She earns coin by helping to tend other folks' campfires, staying warm and overhearing rumors at the same time.\n\nBeldora's secret is that she's a Harper agent. She likes to huddle next to strangers and learn what they know. She conceals a sending stone on her person and uses it once a day to pass along information to Thwip Ironbottom, a Harper agent based in Hundelstone.\n\n**Rendaril's Emporium**. This is the largest trade house in Bryn Shander, on the site of the original cabin around which the town sprang up. The entrance facing the market square serves as the storefront, where visitors can view an assortment of the finest goods for sale in all of Ten-Towns: fishing rods fashioned from elven yew, yeti-skin coats with scrimshaw buttons, mithral fishhooks, axe heads and daggers crafted by the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn, and more. Around the back of the building is an entrance for wholesalers, where caravan traders offload their stock and local adventurers sell pelts and tusks collected on their travels. The owner, Rendaril, is a shrewd merchant who learned his trade in the cutthroat markets of Waterdeep. More coin passes through his hands in a week than most other businesses in Bryn Shander see in a season.\n\n**The Pot & Pestle Apothecary**. Located in a small, unassuming building, this shop is run by a highly intelligent and surprisingly gentle orc named Grak. Unlike most of his kin, Grak prefers the delicate art of alchemy to the brutality of combat. The shop is kept meticulously clean and is organized with a scientist's precision, with jars of glowing liquids and exotic herbs neatly arranged on shelves. The air smells of ozone and strange spices, a stark contrast to Grak's intimidating appearance. He believes that knowledge and fair trade are the best way to prove his people are more than just savage beasts.\n\nGrak's shop is a reliable source for potions of healing, potions of greater healing, and other basic concoctions at reasonable prices, all made with his own hands. He also keeps a large stock of spell components, from bat guano to powdered silver, all organized and meticulously labeled. While he's happy to sell his wares to anyone, he particularly enjoys discussing the finer points of alchemy and the magical properties of rare ingredients with wizards and other arcane spellcasters. He’s always on the lookout for new recipes and uncommon components, often paying fair prices for what others might consider worthless herbs.\n\n**Inns & Taverns**\n\n**Bloodril's Snug Haven**. A cozy retreat near the walls of Bryn Shander. Known for its warm and inviting atmosphere despite its modest make. The establishment is owned and operated by Broodrilletta Tharn, a jovial, boisterous half-orc with a protective nature, a flair for hospitality, and a devotion to Sharess, the goddess of revelry. Broodrilletta's love for music and good company is reflected in the main hall, where an ever-changing cast of new talent performs each evening. The common room is a feast for the senses, with plush velvet cushions, spiced cider on the hearth, and a scent of sweet incense mingling with simple perfumes. Patrons, from weary townsfolk to seasoned travellers, come for the lively music, lively conversation, and the promise of a enjoyable night. Broodrilletta is a master of discretion, and no matter what secrets her guests have, she promises a safe and judgment-free space.\n\nThe brothel section of Bloodril's Snug Haven is located on the second floor, each room finely decorated with cloth hangings and soft lighting. The most sought-after companion is a beautiful aasimar called Seraphina, known for her enchanting whispers and captivating eyes. What few know is that Seraphina is a secret follower of Loviatar, the Maiden of Pain. She finds a twisted sense of pleasure in the emotional and psychological torment of her clients, using their vulnerabilities to manipulate them. A few, she finds, are worthy of her special attention—those she believes are truly worthy of Loviatar's \"blessings.\"\n\n**Faelfaril's Inn**. Faelfaril's Inn is a quaint, if somewhat over-the-top, establishment that's popular with tourists and those who love heroic tales. The entire business is built around the legend that the famous drow hero Drizzt Do'Urden once stayed there. The current owner, a flamboyant human named Faelfaril, claims to be the six-times great-grandson of the elf who hosted Drizzt and has made it his life's work to embellish this familial connection for profit.\n\nThe inn's common room is crammed with what Faelfaril claims are artifacts from Drizzt's stay, including a \"Drizzt's mug\" and a questionable map of his forgotten journeys. The food is simple, but the most expensive meal is the \"Guenhwyvar's Feast,\" a rather bland venison stew. The rooms are named after Drizzt's companions, with the \"Drizzt Suite\" being the most expensive. This small room features a well-worn sword that Faelfaril will tell anyone is a replica of Drizzt's scimitar, charging a hefty fee for the story and the privilege of staying in the hero's supposed room. Faelfaril's grandiloquent stories and high prices draw in travelers and young adventurers but often drive off the more cynical and experienced clientele.\n\nOne of the inn's most regular patrons is Eloc Nosrettap, a jaded historian trying to write a definitive history of the North. He regularly visits to fact-check Faelfaril's tall tales and is convinced that the Drizzt story and artifacts are all fakes. Eloc is a good source for more grounded, accurate information about the region, and he might even pay adventurers to find proof to debunk Faelfaril's claims.\n\n**Geldenstag's Rest**. One of the oldest inns in town, Geldenstag's Rest is run by Myrtle, a gray-haired widow. Myrtle makes it her business to know everyone else's business, asking her guests a lot of questions about what they're up to each day. The inn's accommodations are lackluster—the small rooms are furnished with only a stool, a chamber pot, and two cots with dirty furs thrown over them. It might seem the kind of place that would attract lowlifes and troublemakers, but Myrtle's pestering tends to drive away people who have secrets to keep. The absence of that element from its clientele makes Geldenstag's Rest a popular destination for travelers who aren't looking for too much excitement during their stay in Bryn Shander.\n\n**The Hooked Knucklehead**. This longstanding inn caters to the fishers and scrimshanders who come to Bryn Shander from other towns to conduct business. The innkeeper, Barton, doesn't meddle in his clients' affairs. The accommodations are meager, and the few private rooms lack hearths and are bitterly cold at night. Most of the clientele sleeps in the spacious common room, near the large stone hearth.\n\nOl’ Bitey. Stuffed and mounted on a plaque above the hearth in the common room is a battle-scarred knucklehead trout named Ol' Bitey, who pulled many a fisher into the icy depths of Maer Dualdon before it was finally caught by a human rogue named Kintyre and her companion, a human druid who called himself the Maverick. They hauled Ol' Bitey to the Hooked Knucklehead in the hope of having it cooked for them, but the Innkeeper bought it from them and had it stuffed instead. Years later, some prankster wizard cast a spell on the stuffed fish so that it turns and snaps at any creature that comes within 5 feet of it. Occasionally, seemingly at random, Ol' Bitey sings the following verse instead:\n\n*There's a place I like to go*\n\n*Farther up the river's flow;*\n\n*Where it is, I do not know;*\n\n*Must be under all that snow.*\n\n**Kelvin's Comfort**. The most popular tavern in town, owing to its extensive stock of dwarven ales and brandies, is Kelvin's Comfort. The common room is bedecked with dwarven craft of Battlehammer make, but most of the liquors are imported from Mirabar, on the other side of the Spine of the World. The one Ten-Towns specialty of note is a treacly mead from Good Mead, a neighboring settlement. Caravan masters and guards with plenty of coin often come here, as do visiting dwarves from Kelvin's Cairn. The proprietor of Kelvin's Comfort is Ogden Flamebeard, who has a temper as fiery as his signature drink—a Mirabarran rotgut he gets for cheap and rebottles as Flamebeard's Firebrandy (reselling it at a sizable markup). In his youth, Ogden worked in many famous mines, and he has contacts throughout the dwarfholds of the North, including Mithral Hall.\n\nOne of the patrons of Kelvin's Comfort is Sir Baric Nylef, a knight of Tyr and a member of the Order of the Gauntlet. He's hoping that a few shots of Flamebeard's Firebrandy will keep a nasty cold at bay while he keeps an eye out for a dwarf named Worvil \"the Weevil\" Splithaire, a criminal rumored to be hiding in Ten-Towns. The Weevil led a gang of dwarf brigands that raided summer caravans traveling between Luskan and Mirabar. He also spearheaded several raids on the Mines of Mirabar, stealing food and drink mainly. The Order of the Gauntlet captured most of his gang, but Worvil disappeared into the mountains. Interrogation of the captives led Baric to discover the Weevil's mad craving for Flamebeard's Firebrandy. So, Baric has adopted the guise of an unemployed caravan guard, and his plan is to hang around Kelvin's Comfort for a few days, on the chance that his quarry will walk right through the door.\n\n**The Northlook**. The Northlook is the inn most frequented by mercenaries and adventurers, and as such it's the rowdiest and most dangerous place to stay in Bryn Shander. At the same time, its taproom is the best place in all of Ten-Towns to get the latest news and rumors, including leads on profitable ventures. The proprietor, a retired sellsword who goes by the name Scramsax, takes advantage of the high hopes and good fortunes of his customers by charging the most exorbitant rates in town. Scramsax often cuts a break for customers who are between jobs, allowing them to stay on credit and then presenting them with a bill inflated by interest charges after they earn their next payday. Those who don't settle their accounts discover that the former mercenary doesn't take \"no money\" for an answer, and he still remembers how to handle a blade.\n\n**Temples**\n\n**House of the Triad**. Bryn Shander's largest place of worship, the only one that truly deserves to be called a temple, is an impressive stone edifice built by the dwarves of Kelvin's Cairn. The House of the Triad stands about halfway between the southwest gate and the central market. It honors the three gods known as the Triad: Tyr, the god of justice; Torm, the god of courage and self-sacrifice; and Ilmater, the god of endurance in the face of suffering.\n\nThe temple is attended and maintained by visiting priests and acolytes from Neverwinter and Waterdeep, who usually stay for no more than two years before returning whence they came. At present, the temple is home to priest of Ilmater Torbert Vandall, priestess of Tyr Charlaine Roth, priest of Torm Dellvon Ludwigson and his faithful friend, Sirac of Suzail.\n\nSirac knows that he's a son of the immortal Artus Cimber and thus carries the Cimber bloodline, not that it has ever benefited him. Artus's immortality, it is said, comes from a magic ring—a ring that Sirac has never seen. Sirac's parents gave him up as a baby; he was raised in an orphanage and learned his survival skills as a teenager living on the streets of Suzail. He traveled west with a caravan to Baldur's Gate, then sailed up the Sword Coast to Neverwinter. He came to Icewind Dale three months ago to try his hand at knucklehead trout fishing, and ended up befriending Dellvon Ludwig. Sirac has since come to appreciate Torm's mantra, espousing courage and heroism above all.\n\n**House of the Morninglord**. Located near Bryn Shander's northeast market square, this modest converted house serves as a gathering place for worshipers of Amaunator, a god of the sun known to take both male and female forms. A retired human adventurer named Mishann (neutral good priest of Amaunator) runs the shrine and aspires to see the sun regain its rightful place in the sky over Icewind Dale. She calls Amaunator \"the Morninglord,\" a name that southerners use to describe Lathander, a god of the dawn and rebirth. Mishann views Lathander as a usurper of Amaunator's light and doesn't like it when people confuse the two deities.\n\nCopper Knobberknocker. Mishann rents her attic to a pessimistic rock gnome tinkerer named Copper Knobberknocker (chaotic good rock gnome acolyte of Lathander), who begrudgingly helps with services and chores. The two argue incessantly. Copper walks around in a fuzzy suit and hood that he made himself; although it's quite warm, it makes him look like a teddy bear.\n\nIf the characters talk to Copper, he tells them he's worried about a friend named Macreadus, who is conducting research at an old cabin in the wilderness. He says that if the characters find themselves nearby, he would appreciate it if they looked in on Macreadus, who's trying to build a device that could end the Frostmaiden's eternal winter and return summer to Icewind Dale.\n\n**House of the Frostmaiden**. The only true temple dedicated to the goddess Auril, is a repurposed guard tower on the town's northern perimeter. Its stone walls are perpetually coated in a rime of frost, and a chilling wind seems to emanate from its narrow, unadorned archway. The interior is sparse and frigid, illuminated by pale, guttering candles and a single, unnaturally cold orb of glowing ice suspended from the ceiling. A deep silence hangs in the air, broken only by the crunch of footsteps on the hoarfrost that covers the floor.\n\nThe temple is controlled by Ice-Priestess Demetria, an austere moon elf cleric. Her movements are as silent as a winter's first snowfall, and her skin is the color of fine ivory. She rarely speaks and is attended by a gang of fanatical human zealots who worship Auril's mercilessness. These zealots, known as the Hoarfrost Heralds, maintain a vigilant watch for any who would blaspheme the goddess of winter. Demetria believes the everlasting rime is a blessing from her goddess and is preparing for a pilgrimage to the Sea of Moving Ice to seek a vision from the Frostmaiden.\n\n**Small Shrines to other gods**. Detailed as needed.\n\n**Statues**\n\n**Companions of the Hall Memorial**. A wide, black circle has been laid into the ground in the center of the town, its surface so dark it seems to drink the light. The memorial, made of a polished, obsidian-like stone, feels unnaturally cold to the touch. Etched into the stone are the likenesses of five heroes, each with an item they were known for: Drizzt Do'Urden with his scimitar, Guenhwyvar the panther beside him; Bruenor Battlehammer with his axe; Catti-brie with her bow; Wulfgar with his hammer; and Regis with a small, shiny ruby.\n\nAt the base of the memorial, a simple bronze plaque reads:\n\n\"While all Faerûn may now know their names, t’was us who first called these brave folk heroes.\"\n\n**Tiago’s Memorial**. In the fall of Year of the Mages in Amber, 1466 DR, the drow warrior Tiago Baenre defeated the returned demon Errtu on a plain outside Bryn Shander, endearing himself to the city. In commemoration of that event, a statue of him was erected on that spot, which consisted of a wide black circle. The statue depicted Tiago with a sword and shield. The plaque read:\n\n\"On this spot did Master Tiago slay the demon. And the snows will cover it nevermore.\"\n\n",

Alternatively, you can view this post at: [https://colinsgrandtourcollection.jimdofree.com/gunter-s-tea-shop/](https://colinsgrandtourcollection.jimdofree.com/gunter-s-tea-shop/).\n\n**Introduction**  \nThe Bridgertons love sweets (and enjoy watching their love interests indulge in them (see image 00)).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zsqp59qv0cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=edbdcea0774db9373885fce58140093f37aa5d84\n\nA good enough reason to turn our attention to that London establishment which, more than any other, stood for sweets during the Regency era: Gunter’s Tea Shop, or simply Gunter’s.  \nIt appears several times in the TV series Bridgerton as a charming backdrop. But did you know that Gunter’s influenced the British upper class (and thus probably also the fictional Bridgertons) far more than the TV series initially reveals?  \nThis post invites you to explore the rich history and cultural resonance of Gunter’s in Bridgerton and beyond. Drawing on primary sources from libraries, newspaper archives, and museum collections, it offers insights only partially available elsewhere online to date.  \nAlthough the topics of colonialism, slavery, abolitionism, the free produce movement, and the sugar boycott are undeniably relevant to the broader history of confectionery, they are deliberately omitted here, as the TV series Bridgerton is still a romance and therefore portrays a largely idealised world – and so, in keeping with its tone, this post focuses on the sweet surface rather than the bitter undercurrents.\n\n**1. Gunter’s: the real-life institution**  \nBefore we delve into the portrayal of Gunter’s Tea Shop in Bridgerton, let’s take a moment to discover the real establishment that inspired it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/npsfiohz0cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=7384973f97acc7030958d75fe93431a6ceb11271\n\n**1.1. Historical background**  \nIn 1757, the Italian confectioner Domenico Negri (occasionally referred to as Dominicus Negri) and his Welsh wife, Anne Negri, née Gunter, opened the pastry shop The Pot and Pineapple at 7 Berkeley Square, London.  \nThe shop was often simply called ‘the Pineapple’ (see image 01e). (The pineapple – formerly, like the tree, sometimes termed ‘pine’ – had been regarded as a symbol of luxury in Europe since the 17th century (for specific prices, see section 2.2.1.2.) and served confectioners as a hallmark.)  \nOn 14 January 1767, Mr. Negri, jun. passed away (see image 01a). Later that same year, Domenico Negri entered into a partnership with the confectioner Luke Wetten (Witten in some sources), who was married to Anne’s niece Elizabeth Wetten, née Gunter. This partnership was formally dissolved on 24 June 1775 (see image 01b).  \nAt the same time, Negri announced a new collaboration with Anne’s nephew, the confectioner James Gunter (bap. 1745, d. 1819) (see image 01c) – not to be confused with his cousin of the same name, James Gunter (1755-1801), who ran a confectionery shop at 31 New Bond Street.  \nIn 1780, Domenico Negri returned to Italy, entrusting the management of the business to his wife. That December, shortly before Domenico Negri’s death in 1781, Anne made ‘James Gunter of Berkeley Square’ a partner.  \nAfter Anne had died in 1797, James Gunter took over The Pot and Pineapple as sole proprietor and, in 1799, renamed it Gunter’s Tea Shop, often referred to simply as ‘Gunter’s’.  \nDuring the years that coincide with the narrative timeline of Bridgerton, the following historical developments took place: In 1815, James sent his son Robert Gunter to Paris to train in the confectionery trade. Between 1817 and 1819, the business associated with Gunter’s Tea Shop was also known under the names James and Robert Gunter and Gunter & Son. Upon James’s death on 19 September 1819, Robert took over sole management of the establishment.  \nIn 1837, Robert brought his cousin John Gunter into the business as a partner. Together, they expanded Gunter’s Tea Shop between 1840 and 1841 to include the adjoining premises at 8 Berkeley Square. The business continued under the name Gunter’s Tea Shop at 7-8 Berkeley Square up until the 1930s. It then moved to nearby Curzon Street. The shop was closed in 1956. Today, the Gunter name continues through Payne & Gunter, a high-end event caterer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0l4988f21cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=1203d3405f3db80d1fb6134d5442b0adf40b22b4\n\n**1.2. Offerings, facilities, and location**  \nGunter’s Tea Shop, equally a pastry shop, tearoom, ice cream parlour, and delicatessen, was one of the most fashionable establishments in Mayfair during the Regency era.  \nGunter’s produced and offered English, French, and Italian cakes, biscuits, confectionery, chocolate and sweets, fresh fruit, and fruit processed in every conceivable manner, syrups, cold and hot beverages, ice cream, desserts, and a selection of exquisite hot dishes, such as “turtle soup, made from turtles killed in Honduras”.  \nWhere Gunter Grove is located today, James Gunter had his own luxuriant gardens and hothouses at Earl’s Court, Kensington, from which, during the season, freshly gathered pineapples, raspberries, strawberries, and other fruits were delivered twice a day to the shop at Berkeley Square.  \nTo store the ice imported from Greenland, Norway, and Scotland, required for making ice cream and for cooling purposes, Gunter’s maintained its own ice cellar (see image 02a). (If you are interested in the commerce and storage of natural ice at the time, I recommend this article: [https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6535025/Commercial-ice-house-Georgian-era-unearthed-near-Regents-Park.html](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6535025/Commercial-ice-house-Georgian-era-unearthed-near-Regents-Park.html).)  \nWith its high-class address at 7 Berkeley Square (see image 02b), Gunter’s Tea Shop was only a short walk from Grosvenor Square (for my post on Bridgerton’s Grosvenor Square, see [https://www.reddit.com/r/PolinBridgerton/comments/1emgi8w/a\\_historical\\_walk\\_across\\_bridgertons\\_grosvenor](https://www.reddit.com/r/PolinBridgerton/comments/1emgi8w/a_historical_walk_across_bridgertons_grosvenor)) and therefore also close to Bridgerton House and Featherington House (see image 02c).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jm23md261cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb480509edb988db074c80b0061130079d88702b\n\nThanks to its location on the west side of Berkeley Square (cf. image 03c), visitors to the shop enjoyed a beautiful view of the green garden at the centre of the square. However, in the TV series Bridgerton, the shop’s front window looks out onto a row of houses opposite. This is because, in season one, a retail unit in the listed building at 12/12a Trim Street, Bath ([https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1395396](https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1395396)) was used as the filming location for Gunter’s Tea Shop. As a result, a historically inaccurate house number (12a instead of 7) appears above the entrance door of Gunter’s Tea Shop in season one (see image 03b).  \nFrom season two onwards, Gunter’s Tea Shop has been a reconstructed studio set. Since then, the house number has disappeared, although the view of the row of houses opposite has remained.\n\n**2. Gunter’s in the world of Bridgerton**  \nAfter getting to know the real Gunter’s, as well as briefly touching on its filming location and studio set, we now turn to its fictional counterpart in Bridgerton, as portrayed in both the novels and the TV series.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0apxw591cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=08dabca5ea48d144a1c274261d58249634f061ef\n\n**2.1. Explicit appearances**  \nGunter’s Tea Shop is mentioned only briefly, and only in the first two Bridgerton novels (see images 03a and 04c). In the TV series, however, the shop plays a more prominent role. It is at Gunter’s Tea Shop that Simon licks ice cream off a spoon in episode 1x03 (see image 00a), that Anthony conducts some of his interviews with the season’s eligible misses in episode 2x01 (see image 04b), and that Violet discusses John and Francesca’s wedding and future plans with them in episode 3x08 (see image 01d). In addition, throughout all three seasons, we occasionally see various mamas and their daughters enjoying ice cream there – just as Mary and Edwina do in the second novel.\n\n**2.1.1. Digression on ice cream production**  \nDuring the Regency era, the production of ice cream was, incidentally, a rather elaborate process. Once the ingredients (see image 04d) had been prepared and mixed, they were put into a so-called sorbetière – a freezing pot made of pewter. The sorbetière was then placed inside a large wooden tub filled with a mixture of crushed natural ice (see image 04a) and salt (see image 04e). The salt lowered the temperature of the ice, allowing the ingredients to freeze. Constant stirring with a long, flat wooden spoon known as a spaddle helped to achieve a creamy consistency. As storage required large quantities of natural ice, ice cream was considered a luxury, reserved primarily for members of the upper class (for specific prices, see section 2.2.1.2.).\n\n**2.2. Implicit influences**  \nExplicitly, Gunter’s Tea Shop appears only occasionally as a charming backdrop in Bridgerton. Yet, when we take a closer look through a historical lens, Gunter’s influence becomes evident in many places that might seem entirely unrelated at first glance. In what follows, we will explore where.\n\n**2.2.1. Gunter’s as a tastemaker of the British upper class**  \nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, The Pot and Pineapple and its successor, Gunter’s Tea Shop, developed into a tastemaker, influencing the culinary preferences of Britain’s upper class.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ri48i7ob1cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=37a576fdac5fea2eb7e5f766d3288f312da84a96\n\n**2.2.1.1. Cookery books and culinary ambassadors**  \nFrom an early stage, Domenico Negri and James Gunter encouraged their staff to publish cookery books featuring recipes developed within the establishment (see image 05).  \nThese books were primarily intended for professionals – namely, confectioners and the kitchen staff serving the upper class. All of the cookery books sold well, with most (5a, 5b, 5c, and 5e) undergoing multiple editions and revised reprints.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vm54d5cf1cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9bcf3b6acfc2e48cbef3ad378c1c472cee5e85b\n\nNegri and Gunter also provided many talented men with the opportunity to train as confectioners, and offered numerous housekeepers to noblemen and gentlemen the chance to further their education in their “*peculiar method* of preparing confects” (see image 06a). The former often went on to establish successful businesses elsewhere, while the latter brought their newly acquired expertise back into their households.  \nThrough cookery books and culinary ambassadors, Negri and Gunter’s recipes soon gained considerable influence over the tastes of the upper class, extending well beyond the confines of their shop.  \nIf the establishment ‘Gunter’s Tea Shop’ portrayed in Bridgerton bears even a passing resemblance to its historical counterpart, it is reasonable to assume that many of the delicacies served in the grand houses of the TV series ultimately trace back to recipes of Gunter’s.  \nBelow are a few examples of such treats, accompanied by original recipes from Guglielmo Jarrin’s 1820 publication ‘The Italian confectioner’ (see image 5c). At the time, Jarrin was employed as an ornamental confectioner at Gunter’s. The recipes were developed in the years preceding the book’s release and probably date to the same period in which Bridgerton is set.  \nIf, like Colin, you are “always hungry” (see image 07a) and wish to try these or other recipes from the book, you’ll find them here: [https://wellcomecollection.org/works/h6mm4d6j/items](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/h6mm4d6j/items).\n\nSponge biscuits, p. 162 (see image 07b):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0yxza4kh1cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=8027edcc90eb881e133ac2081967c0fc58f94b96\n\nLemon cakes, p. 166 (see image 08b):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n3346cqj1cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=25ef3d9c291f11ffaf666a4e5ae6cc3ac060871b\n\nBitter macaroons, p. 181 (see image 09b) (While macaroons are technically distinct from macarons, the recipe clearly pertains to the latter – a small inaccuracy we may graciously overlook, given that Jarrin, as he himself apologetically notes in the preface, wrote the book “in a language not native to him”.):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08z405yl1cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=3babd3d512fd0bf8d2bb3a5284bc87b16f49bb01\n\nLemonade, p. 156 (see image 10a) (For the authentic Bridgerton flavour, mix with Orgeat syrup, p. 46.):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/79u5d21o1cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=669b399e542f35bdf59b432fb5b958d7e9ed72a2\n\nRaspberry marmalade, p. 54 (see image 11c) (Strictly speaking, marmalade is distinct from jam, but once again, Jarrin’s linguistic limitations must be taken into account – cf. Bitter macaroons.):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tp2ja3q1cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=c81aa77a843dee292432cb8f486c87e3f1cb18cb\n\n**2.2.1.2. Deliveries and catering**  \nIf you’re fond of jam, there’s no need to make it yourself – you could simply purchase it ready-made. Gunter’s was already offering this convenience to its customers by the beginning of the 19th century. The shop stocked a wide variety of jams and marmalades, sold in stoneware jars (see image 11a). Customers purchasing larger quantities could have the goods delivered directly to their homes.  \nMany high-ranking and aristocratic families engaged Gunter’s services over several generations. The Pot and Pineapple had already held the title of ‘Confectioner to His Royal Highness the Duke of York’, and Gunter’s was likewise patronised by the royal family.  \nYet Gunter’s was not merely a supplier – it was also one of the leading society caterers of its time, providing catering services for large-scale events across the country. These occasions were often of the kind familiar to us from Bridgerton. Below are a few examples that call to mind Violet Bridgerton’s masquerade ball, Lady Danbury’s balls, or the annual Smythe-Smith musicale.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gp4xx67s1cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=415219ccc56fe36e5e312cd58e728a7f8ca81792\n\nIn 1801, Gunter’s provided catering for the masquerade hosted by the first wife of British MP William Morton Pitt (see image 12b), in 1820, for the Countess of Mansfield’s ball (see image 12c), and in 1827, most likely for the grand entertainment and/or music party held by the wife of banker Nathan Mayer Rothschild (see images 13a, 13b, and 13c).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q25wtaau1cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=a17dc420fd0756fcd48d8a29d9972abdcf2697d4\n\nUnlike the newspaper articles on the events at the Pitt and Mansfield households, the articles concerning the social assemblies at Rothschild do not explicitly name Gunter’s as the caterer.  \nHowever, the ledger of Gunter’s records that on 4 July 1827, the establishment supplied Nathan Rothschild with a “man cook” and “8 attendants”, together with provisions of food and drink for a lavish gathering. The total cost of these services amounted to £562. 7s. 6d. (The symbols £, s, and d refer to the pre-decimal system of currency used in Britain up to 1971: £ = pounds (librae), s = shillings (solidi), d = pence (denarii). One pound was equivalent to 20 shillings or 240 pence. Converted to the decimal system, £562. 7s. 6d. equals £562,38. According to a historically accurate inflation calculator ([https://www.in2013dollars.com/uk/inflation/1827](https://www.in2013dollars.com/uk/inflation/1827)), this corresponds to a modern purchasing power of £75.951,60. At the exchange rates on 29 August 2025, this would be €87.707,76 or $102.267,52.)  \nThe entries in the ledger of Gunter’s offer a glimpse into the cost of ice cream and non-alcoholic refreshments (see my red markings on image 13a) served at social assemblies like those depicted in Bridgerton.  \nGunter’s charged £1. 12s. for “8 x 24 \\[servings of\\] Orangeade” or “Currant Water”, and £1. 4s. for “8 x 24 \\[servings of\\] Lemonade” (⇒ 1,5 pre-decimal pence per serving), which nowadays equates to £162,06 (⇒ £0,84 per serving), €186,91 (⇒ €0,97 per serving) or $218,32 (⇒ $1,13 per serving).  \nGunter’s priced the ice cream at £3. for “6 x 24 \\[servings of\\] Plain Ice”, “Strawberry Ice” or “Raspberry Ice” (⇒ 5 pre-decimal pence per serving), which equates to £405,16 (⇒ £2,81 per serving), €467,35 (⇒ €3,24 per serving) or $545,88 (⇒ $3,78 per serving) in today’s money. To the upper class, five pre-decimal pence was little more than loose change. For a working-class labourer, however, it equated to approximately a quarter to a third of a day’s wage at the time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6i0wd6ww1cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=9917de9d6dfda83020cee1ef14464ae3187344e0\n\nWhile working-class labourers might have been able to afford ice cream on special occasions, a pineapple, such as the one served at Anthony’s first wedding (see image 14a), would have been entirely beyond their means.  \nIn 1827, Gunter’s charged Nathan Rothschild £1. 19s. for a “Fine Pineapple” (not visible in image 13a), which nowadays equates to £263,36, €303,77 or $354,30.  \nIt is hardly surprising that a dessert buffet resembling the one at Anthony and Edwina’s wedding, and comparable to those actually offered by Gunter’s (see image 14b), would have cost a fortune. Considering that the wedding in the TV series was hosted by Queen Charlotte, the notion that Gunter’s may have been the caterer appears entirely plausible.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tcpwvzbz1cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=0194d6977390ee63eb7c887e05a184ea0db86333\n\n**2.2.1.3. Wedding cakes**  \nThis is especially true when one takes Anthony and Edwina’s wedding cake into account (see image 15a). As early as the beginning of the 19th century, Gunter’s was among the most sought-after wedding caterers within Britain’s upper class. The establishment was particularly renowned for its wedding cakes, without which no marriage in high-life was complete.  \nFollowing Queen Victoria’s wedding in 1840, Gunter’s effectively became the sole supplier of all wedding cakes for all Royal and aristocratic marriages (see image 15b). It is therefore reasonable to assume that Gunter’s may also have provided the wedding cakes for members of the Bridgerton family. The resemblance between the cake served at Anthony and Edwina’s wedding and that of Princess Louise of Wales and the Duke of Fife is unmistakable.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f5xnema12cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=50f5b921a0b86e6b7ab5949808dc43dd1f2b0363\n\nSimon and Daphne’s wedding cake was presented to their guests in much the same manner as the one supplied by Gunter’s for the second wedding of the Baron Saye and Sele (see images 16b and 16c).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/027esh732cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=a749d96f8e26c05dccb7401c0f6c136da67eccc7\n\nFinally, it is quite likely that Lisa Heathcote ([http://www.lisaheathcote.co.uk](http://www.lisaheathcote.co.uk/)), food stylist for season three of the TV series Bridgerton and successor to home economist Debi Lindsay ([http://www.thehomeeconomist.tv/credits.html](http://www.thehomeeconomist.tv/credits.html)), who designed and decorated the cakes for seasons one and two, took inspiration for Colin and Penelope’s wedding cake (see image 17a) from the sumptuous decorative style of Gunter’s (see image 17b).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mu5zmf252cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=83e70fc0053e9527c54c9afeaf8f83e511158d5f\n\n**2.2.2. Gunter’s as a matchmaker of the British upper class**  \nGunter’s did not merely bake for weddings – it helped bring them about. During the Regency era, Gunter’s Tea Shop was a popular rendezvous for courting couples, as it was one of the few places young ladies could visit unchaperoned (if only Colin had known...). By the early 19th century, it had become customary for ladies to enjoy their ice cream or sorbet not inside the shop, but outdoors. They would park their carriages in the shade cast by the trees of the garden at the centre of Berkeley Square (see image 18b) and remain seated, while their attendant gentlemen lounged and lolled by the railings, and waiters dashed across the street with trays to serve them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3ckm7172cmf1.png?width=2339&format=png&auto=webp&s=d145113cae689b768fbdd693694441f412292369\n\nMany marriages were sealed thanks to Gunter’s, including that of the fictional Miss Mary Leopold, who “secured a betrothal over a plate of sugared almonds and liquorice in just four and a half minutes” in 1804, as depicted in the TV series Bridgerton (see image 19a).\n\n**2.3. Looking ahead: Gunter’s in future seasons**  \nHaving explored Gunter’s historical role in matchmaking, we conclude by turning our gaze to its fictional future in Bridgerton.  \nAccording to UnBoxPHD on X ([https://x.com/UnBoxPHD/status/1840027199623078066/photo/3](https://x.com/UnBoxPHD/status/1840027199623078066/photo/3)), Gunter’s Tea Shop is set to appear in season four of Bridgerton. As Julia Quinn’s novel ‘An offer from a gentleman’ offers no clues as to which scenes might feature the establishment, here are a few playful speculations:  \n\\- Might we see the Bridgerton kitchen staff interacting with the employees of Gunter’s?  \n\\- Could Gunter’s be entrusted with the catering for Violet’s masquerade ball?  \n\\- Will Benedict conduct awkward bride interviews at Gunter’s Tea Shop, despite the fact that he is determined to marry no one but the mysterious Lady in Silver?  \n\\- Might Anthony and Kate take their children there for ice cream?  \n\\- Will ‘hungry boy’ Colin and his wife Penelope, rather than indulging in the baked goods from Ms. Plaskitt’s Sweet Treats (which, unlike Gunter’s, never actually existed), opt instead for Gunter’s delights? Or perhaps we’ll see the two of them dancing near the shop in Berkeley Square?  \n\\- Could Eloise meet with “political radicals” there, considering that tearooms, although a few decades later, were regarded as hotbeds of women’s rights activism (see [https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/womens-history/suffrage/taking-tea-and-talking-politics/](https://historicengland.org.uk/research/inclusive-heritage/womens-history/suffrage/taking-tea-and-talking-politics/))?  \nWe’ll find out in 2026. Until then, let’s wait and see and sip some tea!\n\n**Image references**  \n**01a**: Yesterday died Mr. Negri, jun.

    "text": "I am desperately in need of some guidance if anyone can help. I have an appointment with Heritage Auctions this week regarding my late father's coin collection, and my husband has asked me to bring these along.                  Let me preface this by saying I have not been researching coins for very long.Tomorrow will be the first time I have seen my father's collection. I knew he had one, I guess I just always thought about it in the abstract.                                                                                      Back to the pennies.While I know you don't come across error coins every day, I know there are a lot that probably slip through the cracks. My husband likes to put away anything he finds interesting. These are the two best examples of coins he has saved, at least for photos. Most I have to view through a jeweler's loupe to discern the difference. The color difference is obvious, I'm just not sure what that means. I would love to hear any opinions you may have on them.                                   I have read all the reviews of Heritage, and I need to know I won't be walking in there unprepared. I will have less than a week to review my dad's collection, and I would like to be sure I have some basic knowledge  before I get there.                                                                    Having said that, I may be reaching out for more advice in the next few days. Any help would be appreciated.Thanks in advance for your time:)",

Joe Snake Eyes v1 Strait Arm with Cobra Commander Offer AFA 85 \\*\\* POP 4, Highest Grade \\*\\* (Hasbro, 1982).** One of the most iconic action figures of the 1980s, Snake Eyes made his debut in Hasbro's 1982 relaunch of *G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero* as part of the original 9-back assortment. With his all-black commando gear, mysterious masked appearance, and silent-but-deadly persona, Snake Eyes quickly became a defining figure in the line, cementing his legendary status in both toy and comic book history. This version features the early Cobra Commander mail-away offer, placing it among the earliest packaging variants for the character. Graded AFA 85 Y-NM+ with subgrades of C80 B85 F90, this example is a POP 4 and stands as the highest graded example known to exist, with none graded higher. The yellowed bubble is typical for early G.I. Joe releases but remains clear and intact, and the overall presentation is exceptional. An absolute grail for G.I. Joe collectors, early cardback enthusiasts, or anyone building a top-tier run of the most important characters in action figure history, this is a flagship piece that rarely appears in this condition. A definitive version of a pop culture icon.  \n  \nHeritage Auctions provides as much information as possible but strongly encourages in-person inspection.

    "text": "# This week Kevin O’Leary, better known as Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank/ Dragon's Den, purchased a sports card featuring both Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant for a staggering $12.932 million ([basketballinsiders.org](https://www.basketballinsiders.org/news/shark-tanks-kevin-oleary-bought-mj-kobe-card-for-record-12-9m/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).\n\nI have collected sports cards since I was a kid, and when COVID hit in 2020, I dove deep back into the hobby and never looked back.\n\nThere is something magical about ripping open a fresh pack of cards. Chasing rookies, prospects, or members of my all-time favourite teams is pure joy. But those packs today are so expensive that you usually need to pull a mythical ultra-rare card just to break even. That is why, like Mr. Wonderful, I focus on buying single cards, affordable ones, because I am definitely not in the league of spending hundreds of thousands, let alone millions.\n\nWhen it comes to my own collection, I focus mostly on baseball and basketball, with a bit of dabbling in hockey. I have built a personal collection of **Trae Young cards** because I love the underdog that people dismiss. I do not recommend this approach if you are looking at value. While his cards spiked during the Hawks’ deep playoff run in 2021, they have gone down overall since then. Ultimately, the mass market drives most of the value trends, and it does not usually reward the underdogs. I also collect **Yordan Alvarez**, because I just think he is an awesome hitter, and **Bobby Witt Jr.**, who I went deep on when I first got back into the hobby. More recently I have taken profits off some of those Witt cards, since I bought them low and they peaked coming into this season after his breakout year. The nerd side of me is also collecting the **1980 Star Wars** ***Empire Strikes Back*** set graded by PSA. There are 360 cards in the set and I am about 60 shy of finishing it. And I also collected some rare **Hulk Hogan cards**, which I recently sold off after his passing.\n\nThe market went wild from 2020 to 2022 before correcting in 2022 and 2023. Now it is mostly the rarest cards or players who become all-time greats that hold their value. Rarity is everything. Mr. Wonderful’s card, the only dual “Logoman” patch featuring both Jordan and Kobe with autographs, is basically the holy grail of the hobby. Think da Vinci and Van Gogh on the same canvas. Sure it is cardboard, but in reality, things are worth what someone will pay for them. And right now, cardboard is more iconic than ever. Collecting is booming with more people, more passion, and deeper connections than the 90s ever had.\n\nBut you need to be careful getting into these things, just like investing. A player’s value can disappear overnight. I watched hundreds of people pour money into Henry Ruggs cards, only to see them become worthless after he killed someone drinking and driving. Unless you are holding a true all-time great or a piece with unique rarity, a lot of cards are just as risky as any speculative investment.\n\nThis trend mirrors the rise of alternative investments: collectibles, crypto, fractional shares, even fractional ownership in paintings, rare coins, stamps, watches, or historical documents. It is like **Antiques Roadshow on steroids**, but for everyone, not just some late-night TV curiosity.\n\nDelving into this world cold can be daunting. Sports cards get complex fast. If you are curious, do your homework. Follow creators, read up, and find supportive communities. Just avoid the groups where people ask, *“How much is my Dave Stieb rookie worth?”* over and over.\n\nFor me, collecting is not about the jackpot. It is about that nostalgic spark, the thrill of the hunt, and reconnecting with something I love.\n\n# Learn More About Sports Card Collecting & Investing\n\n**Buying & Selling**\n\n* **eBay** – Still the biggest place to buy and sell cards\n* **Alt** – Modern buying and selling platform with vault and auction tools (alt.xyz)\n* **Fanatics Collect** – Growing marketplace thanks to big sports partnerships\n\n**Data & Tools**\n\n* **Sports Card Investor** – Market data, trends, investing strategy ([sportscardinvestor.com](https://www.sportscardinvestor.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* **Market Movers** – Price tracking and collection management for over 1M cards ([marketmoversapp.com](https://www.marketmoversapp.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n* [**NoOffseason.com**](http://NoOffseason.com) – Trading tips, rankings, and budget strategies\n* **Beckett Media** – Longstanding authority on grading and value guides but IMO has fallen way behind (beckett.com)\n\n**Auctions & High-End Collecting**\n\n* **Goldin Auctions** – High-profile collectible auctions, featured on *King of Collectibles*\n* **Heritage Auctions** – One of the biggest names in sports cards and memorabilia\n* **Sports Collectors Digest** – Hobby news, classifieds, and auction insights\n\n**Podcasts & Video Channels**\n\n* [Sports Card Investor Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sports-card-investor/id1473711424?utm_source=chatgpt.com) – Market analysis from Geoff Wilson\n* [Sports Cards Live](https://www.youtube.com/@SportsCardsLive?utm_source=chatgpt.com) – Weekly livestreams with guest experts\n* [SlabStox Podcast](https://www.slabstox.com/podcast/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) – Data-driven trends and tips\n* [Sports Card Strategy Show](https://podcast.feedspot.com/sports_card_podcasts/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) – Buying and investing advice\n* [Sports Card Dad](https://www.youtube.com/@TheSportsCardDad?utm_source=chatgpt.com) – Friendly YouTube content for collectors\n\nI am sure there are more awesome resources out there, so feel free to top this list up with your own favourites.\n\nThis is not financial advice.

    "text": "Hi r/ecommerce - I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** More than 50% of adults across the US, UK, Canada, and Australia use Gen AI for e-commerce tasks at least once a month. 65% opt for ChatGPT over Google for tasks like product research, personalized recommendations, and finding deals, according to an Omnisend study.\n___\n**The Trump administration** announced Friday that it has taken a 10% stake in **Intel**, paid for through $5.7B in grants previously awarded to Intel under the 2022 U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, plus $3.2B awarded to the company as part of a program called Secure Enclave, a formerly classified initiative funded by Congress in 2024 that's designed to support the trusted manufacturing of advanced microelectronics for U.S. government and defense use. This investment is structured as passive ownership, meaning the government holds non‑voting shares and agrees to vote with Intel's board on shareholder matters.\n___\n**Here's how Google is positioning itself to power the AI race, even if you don't use its tools:** \n\n**Meta** signed a six-year $10B cloud computing deal with **Google** to use Google Cloud servers, storage, networking, and other services, possibly a temporary move to fill a gap in processing power as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to build several of its own massive AI data centers. 2) Google inked a similar deal with OpenAI back in May.\n\nBut that's not all **OpenAI** has been relying on **Google** for. The Information reports that OpenAI has been using scraped Google search results from SerpApi to help power ChatGPT responses, particularly for current events, despite Google having denied its direct request for access. OpenAI supplements the scraped data with its own web crawler and Microsoft’s Bing API, but executives admit that replicating Google’s search accuracy currently remains out of reach for the company.\n\n**Apple** is in early talks to use **Google's Gemini AI** to revamp its Siri voice assistant, according to Bloomberg sources, who say that Apple recently approached Google to develop custom AI models to power a redesigned Siri next year. Apple, which is admittedly behind in the AI race, is still debating whether to stick with in-house Siri models (which is becoming more difficult as its best AI engineers keep getting poached by competitors) or switch to an external partner, which it hasn't yet chosen. They also discussed potential partnerships with Anthropic and OpenAI earlier this year.\n___\nStarting September 1, **TikTok** will require all brands advertising products on TikTok Shop to use its AI-powered GMV Max tool, which completely automates campaign management to maximize sales, removing granular controls that advertisers previously had such as the ability to manually select audiences by age, gender, and location, control bidding strategies like CPC of CPA, and choose placements, such as on TikTok's feed versus partner apps. Now merchants can only set budgets and ROI targets, and the algorithm takes over from there to determine ad placements, creative boosting, and spending.\n___\n**Meta** rolled out a series of new AI-driven advertising and shopping features ahead of the holiday season, focused on helping brands merchandise through Reels and creators, diversify ad creative, and connect online and in-store sales to improve campaign performance. New improvements include Creator Filters Expansion, Creator Catalog Ads, Creator Testimonials, Reel Product Discovery, Swipe-Up Info Cards, Related Media Suggestions, and more. Honestly it's a fairly large update that you might want to dig deeper into if you run Meta ads.\n___\n**Best Buy** launched its long anticipated third-party marketplace in the U.S. as of Aug 19, 2025, more than doubling the number of products available through its website and introducing new brands and categories to its assortment. As you might remember, Best Buy previously attempted to run a third-party marketplace in the U.S. from 2011 to 2016, but eventually shut it down because it only brought in 1% of revenue and created confusion among buyers who thought they could return products sold by third-party sellers to Best Buy stores (which they can now do). The marketplace initially has about 500 sellers, which the company says it vetted down to the ones who can provide a high-quality customer experience and match its return policy, with plans to soon introduce licensed sports merchandise with Fanatics.\n___\n**President Trump** called national security and privacy concerns related to **TikTok** and **ByteDance** “highly overrated” on Friday and said that he'll keep extending the deadline for the ban until there's a buyer. To make matters even worse (or better, depending on how you view things)… The White House joined TikTok on Tuesday and began sharing video clips of President Trump and his staff, portraying them as strong and effective American leaders. Meanwhile, China is laughing at America. The CCP published an editorial in the state-owned media outlet China Daily, first applauding the White House for creating an official TikTok account, and then gloating at the inconsistency between the White House's actions and Congress's ban of the app for security reasons.\n___\n**In other TikTok news…** the company denies rumors that the app has been unbanned in India, after brief website access sparked media reports of a possible comeback in the country, more than five years after it was banned. A TikTok representative told TechCrunch, “We have not restored access to TikTok in India and continue to comply with the Government of India's directive.”\n___\nA leaked document obtained by **Adweek** reveals how much major retailers charge advertisers for using their shopper data on **The Trade Desk**, America's largest independent, self-service demand-side platform. The pricing varies by retailer, typically calculated as a percentage of media costs with CPM caps, and often comes with unique requirements on measurement, minimum spends, and ad approval. The Trade Desk couldn’t confirm if the leaked document was internal, but four industry sources told Adweek the pricing details matched their own experiences with the platform. The leaked pricing guide shows how fragmented and retailer-specific The Trade Desk’s retail media costs and rules are, with measurement fees ranging from free to $1 CPM and requirements varying from strict co-branding mandates to flat bans on alcohol and pharmaceutical advertisers.\n___\n**xAI** is taking heat for publicly publishing the chat transcripts of hundreds of thousands of conversations between its chatbot **Grok** and its users, and making them visible and indexable by Google, without the user being explicitly aware. A search for Grok chats shows that Google indexed more than 370,000 user conversations about topics ranging from simple business tasks like writing blogs to attempting to hack into a crypto wallet. Some chats even revealed the name, personal details, and even passwords shared with Grok, as well as image files, spreadsheets, and text documents uploaded by users. If it sounds familiar, it's becuase I've covered almost identical news in recent editions involving OpenAI and Meta AI chats. Both companies fell under scrutiny for allowing literally the exact same thing.\n___\n**Amazon** updated its robots.txt file to block six additional AI-related crawlers from companies including Meta, Google, Huawei, and Mistral, expanding earlier restrictions on bots from Anthropic and Perplexity, as spotted by independent analyst Juozas Kaziukėnas. The move is part of Amazon’s ongoing effort to prevent AI firms from using its product and pricing data to train models or enable shopping tools that could bypass its storefront and threaten its $56B ad business. While robots.txt rules are voluntary and much of Amazon’s data has already been scraped, the company is taking a harder line than rivals like Walmart and eBay, as it develops its own shopping AI tools like Rufus.\n___\n**Omnisend** announced that it will be discontinuing its Product Reviews feature for Shopify merchants as of Sep 19, 2025, which it only launched in April 2024. The company is instead partnering with and recommending that merchants switch to Yotpo, which recently announced that it would be sunsetting its e-mail and SMS marketing platform at the end of the year. While some SaaS companies in the Shopify ecosystem are still pursuing an all-inclusive model, offering features that have traditionally required multiple apps under one roof, others are stepping away from diversifying their feature portfolio to double-down on their core services. The recent moves demonstrate the risk for merchants of putting too many eggs in one app developer's basket.\n___\n**UPS** is offering voluntary buyouts to select U.S. operations managers as it streamlines its network and reduces volume tied to Amazon. Eligible employees can apply between Aug. 26 and Sept. 9, with separations occurring through July 2026 Packages include cash based on tenure, healthcare, and outplacement services. The move follows lower-than-expected attrition from 74 building closures, and comes alongside an existing buyout program for full-time drivers offering $1,800 per year of service with a $10,000 minimum payout.\n___\n**At eBay Open 2025**, sellers said the clear message was that eBay is “all in on AI,” with new tools like AI-powered messaging responses, image-based “magical” listing, and description generators. While many of these features require seller opt-in, eBay is also increasingly inserting AI between buyers and sellers without disclosure, including AI-generated FAQs in search results, description summaries on Facebook Marketplace, and item detail highlights on listing pages. Sellers raised concerns about accuracy, potential “Item Not As Described” claims, and IP risks after eBay revealed it may use AI to strip watermarks from images before sending them to Google.\n___\n**Target** will soon stop fulfilling online orders from many of its stores so that they can refocus teams on improving their drive-up and in-store experiences. Michael Fiddelke, the company's current COO and incoming CEO, told investors that Target stopped some stores in Chicago from fulfilling e-commerce orders as part of a test, diverting those orders to bigger locations, and plans to do the same in 30-40 more markets by the end of the year. The move aims to address concerns that online fulfillment created too many out-of-stock scenarios and hurt customer service. I'm sure the racism related boycotts against the company and its retreat from DEI didn't help either.\n___\n**Hertz** struck a deal with **Amazon** to begin selling pre-owned vehicles on Amazon Autos, starting with customers within 75 miles of Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and Seattle, before expanding to 45 locations nationwide. Shoppers can browse, e-sign paperwork, and complete purchases online, then pick up vehicles at Hertz locations. The deal boosts Hertz’s retail car sales business, which sells hundreds of thousands of vehicles annually, while expanding Amazon’s growing autos platform, which recently added used cars.\n___\n**Elon Musk** tried to get **Mark Zuckerberg** on board of his unsolicited $97.4B offer to purchase the non-profit that controls OpenAI earlier this year, according to court filings made on Thursday, but neither Zuckerberg nor Meta signed the letter of intent or participated in the bid. As part of its filing, OpenAI urged the judge to order Meta to share any documents and communications related to Musk's bid in order to “shed light on the motivations for the bid.” Meta asked the court to deny the subpoena and instead require OpenAI to seek documents directly from Musk.\n___\n**Meta** announced internally that it is splitting its AI division known as Meta Superintelligence Labs into four groups: one to focus on AI research, a second one exclusively for exploring superintelligence, a third one on products, and a fourth on infrastructure like data centers and other AI hardware. How about a fifth for the metaverse? Remember that? LOL. New York Times sources said that the reorganization is likely to be final one for some time and is aimed at better organizing Meta so it can get to its goal of superintelligence and develop AI products more quickly to compete with others.\n___\n**TikTok** is rolling out a new feature called Campus Verification to more than 6,000 universities that is designed to help college students connect with their classmates. How do you like them apples, Meta? The feature invites students to add their graduation year and enter their school e-mail address and then populates a list of other verified student users from their same class for them to follow and connect with. Meta launched a similar concept in 2020 called Facebook Campus, but shut the program down a couple of years later due to quitting everything too soon.\n___\n**Meta** plans to unveil new smart glasses, codenamed Hypernova, at its Connect conference in September, marking its first consumer-ready glasses with a display. The $800 device will feature a small screen in the right lens for displaying simple visual content like messages and will pair with a wristband that interprets neural signals to control the glasses through hand gestures. Alongside Hypernova, Meta will also release a third-generation of its voice-only smart glasses, as it seeks to expand its wearable ecosystem and gather developer support for AI-powered applications.\n___\n**EU officials** are exploring the possibility of issuing its upcoming digital euro on public blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, versus on a closed system as previously expected. Advocates say a public chain could boost adoption and cross-border use of the euro, while critics raise concerns over transparency, since public blockchains record transactions openly. The debate follows the U.S. passage of the Genius Act, which eased the launch of dollar-pegged stablecoins and raised concerns that such tokens could undermine Europe’s financial stability and global influence.\n___\nLast week I shared that **eBay** will begin automatically leaving positive feedback for sellers if they use a tracked service, deliver on time, and no issues are reported. This week Liz Morton of Value Added Resource updated the story to report the counter side to that news, which is that it will also be harder to get certain types of feedback removed. eBay announced that moving forward, if a buyer's comment includes both removable and non-removable content, it'll give the customer the option to edit the removable part so their feedback is published. Additionally, sellers will no longer see automatic removal of negative or neutral feedback in cases involving free returns or partial refund deductions for used or damaged items, potentially leaving sellers vulnerable to abusive buyers.\n___\n**In hires this week…** **Target** named Michael Fiddelke, its current COO, as its next CEO, who will succeed Brian Cornell on Feb 1st. Cornell, who has been at the role since 2014, will transition to executive chair on Target's board of directors. Wow, quite the leadership shakeup. Also **Meta** hired another senior Apple AI engineer named Frank Chu, who will join the company's Superintelligence Labs, despite the division being under a hiring freeze, marking the sixth Apple AI researcher to defect to the company in the past seven weeks. Lastly **OpenAI** poached Sheeladitya Mohanty from Meta, where he led Meta AI and Facebook marketing in APAC, and appointed him their new Marketing Lead for India, as part of the company's attempt to grow engagement in the country.\n___\n**In layoffs this week…** **TikTok** is planning to layoff hundreds of content moderators and security staff in London and Southeast Asia, as it begins to automate more of that work with AI. Meanwhile, speaking of AI, **Cisco** is laying off 221 workers, primarily software engineers, despite a revenue surge and the CEO's claim that AI wouldn't cost jobs. Filings for the layoffs were made on the same day that Cisco announced Q4 earnings that showed revenue was up 8% YoY to $14.7B.\n___\n**X** agreed to settle thousands of cases brought by former employees who sued the company for severance after Elon Musk dismissed them during his 2022 takeover. After acquiring Twitter, Musk reduced its workforce to fewer than 2,000 employees from around 7,500, and a class-action suit filed in 2023 claimed that he owed the fired workers about $500M in severance payments. Musk's legal battle with former senior Twitter executives over $128M in severance payments is continuing however.\n___\n**Samujjal Purkayastha**, a former Meta product manager alleges the company bypassed Apple’s App Tracking Transparency rules by using “deterministic matching” to track users without consent and inflated Shops Ads performance by counting gross sales (which included shipping and taxes) instead of net sales like industry peers, overstating results by up to 19%. The whistleblower, who says he was fired for raising concerns, also claims Meta secretly subsidized ads with a $160M budget authorized by Mark Zuckerberg when testing ways to bypass Apple's rules. The case adds to Meta’s history of bullshitting ad metrics and raises questions about Apple’s ability to enforce its privacy rules.\n___\n**Bonanza** is facing a proposed class action lawsuit alleging that the marketplace allowed third parties to collect personal information from its users through the use of pixel trackers operated by Google, Meta, Microsoft, Klaviyo, Pinterest, and Criteo, in violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act. The lawsuit claims that users didn't consent to the installation or use of the trackers and that Bonanza did not comply with their own posted privacy policy regarding this kind of tracking. It's important to note that the suit is being brought by the law firms Nathan & Associates and Ross Cornell, which filed an almost identical suit against Etsy last month. So while Bonanza have very well copy/pasted their privacy policy from a free privacy policy generation website and have no idea what any of it means, the suit itself could also be bit of a digital ambulance chase. \n___\n**Andrew & William Tate** filed lawsuits against Meta and TikTok for “emotional distress, business interference, and misappropriation” for being kicked off of the platforms in 2022 where they both “commanded an audience of tens of millions, generated significant revenue through lawful online enterprises, and were among the most visible public figures on TikTok's platform.” The brothers, who face rape and sex-trafficking charges in Romania and the U.K and criminal investigations in the U.S., are seeking $50M for themselves and for “the people everywhere who have been lied about, banned, cancelled.” Honestly, fuck the Tate brothers, but I do enjoy and support when Big Tech gets legally challenged, especially over their arbitrary enforcement of ambiguous deplatforming rules. \n___\n**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** A freelance writer named Jolissa Skow discovered that someone was pretending to be her in order to write for a large publication for the past several years! The Fake Jolissa had been using her name, bio, photos, writing samples, and even her home address since 2023 and was a regular participant in the company's Slack. The whole time, the entire company was engaging with Fake Jolissa, who never got on camera during meetings, citing a fabricated speech impediment disability that would happen when on camera. Eventually the Real Jolissa found out and contacted the company, which took immediate action — but damn. Background check much?\n___\nPlus 15 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Klaviyo** acquiring **Gatsby**, a social automation platform that helps brands convert interactions like DMs, mentions, tags, and follows into owned customer data like email & SMS subscribers. \n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful. See you next week!\n\nPAUL  \nEditor of Shopifreaks E-Commerce Newsletter\n\nPS: If I missed any big news this week, please share in the comments.",

    "text": "Hi [r/Shopify](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shopify/) \\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter, which I've published weekly since 2021.\n\nI was invited by the Mods of this subreddit to share my weekly e-commerce news recaps (ie: shorter versions of my full editions) to [r/Shopify](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shopify/). Although my news recaps aren't strictly about Shopify (some weeks Shopify is covered more than others), I hope they bring value to your business no matter what platform you're on.\n\nLet's dive into this week's top stories...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** More than 50% of adults across the US, UK, Canada, and Australia use Gen AI for e-commerce tasks at least once a month. 65% opt for ChatGPT over Google for tasks like product research, personalized recommendations, and finding deals, according to an Omnisend study.\n___\n**The Trump administration** announced Friday that it has taken a 10% stake in **Intel**, paid for through $5.7B in grants previously awarded to Intel under the 2022 U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, plus $3.2B awarded to the company as part of a program called Secure Enclave, a formerly classified initiative funded by Congress in 2024 that's designed to support the trusted manufacturing of advanced microelectronics for U.S. government and defense use. This investment is structured as passive ownership, meaning the government holds non‑voting shares and agrees to vote with Intel's board on shareholder matters.\n___\n**Here's how Google is positioning itself to power the AI race, even if you don't use its tools:** \n\n**Meta** signed a six-year $10B cloud computing deal with **Google** to use Google Cloud servers, storage, networking, and other services, possibly a temporary move to fill a gap in processing power as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to build several of its own massive AI data centers. 2) Google inked a similar deal with OpenAI back in May.\n\nBut that's not all **OpenAI** has been relying on **Google** for. The Information reports that OpenAI has been using scraped Google search results from SerpApi to help power ChatGPT responses, particularly for current events, despite Google having denied its direct request for access. OpenAI supplements the scraped data with its own web crawler and Microsoft’s Bing API, but executives admit that replicating Google’s search accuracy currently remains out of reach for the company.\n\n**Apple** is in early talks to use **Google's Gemini AI** to revamp its Siri voice assistant, according to Bloomberg sources, who say that Apple recently approached Google to develop custom AI models to power a redesigned Siri next year. Apple, which is admittedly behind in the AI race, is still debating whether to stick with in-house Siri models (which is becoming more difficult as its best AI engineers keep getting poached by competitors) or switch to an external partner, which it hasn't yet chosen. They also discussed potential partnerships with Anthropic and OpenAI earlier this year.\n___\nStarting September 1, **TikTok** will require all brands advertising products on TikTok Shop to use its AI-powered GMV Max tool, which completely automates campaign management to maximize sales, removing granular controls that advertisers previously had such as the ability to manually select audiences by age, gender, and location, control bidding strategies like CPC of CPA, and choose placements, such as on TikTok's feed versus partner apps. Now merchants can only set budgets and ROI targets, and the algorithm takes over from there to determine ad placements, creative boosting, and spending.\n___\n**Meta** rolled out a series of new AI-driven advertising and shopping features ahead of the holiday season, focused on helping brands merchandise through Reels and creators, diversify ad creative, and connect online and in-store sales to improve campaign performance. New improvements include Creator Filters Expansion, Creator Catalog Ads, Creator Testimonials, Reel Product Discovery, Swipe-Up Info Cards, Related Media Suggestions, and more. Honestly it's a fairly large update that you might want to dig deeper into if you run Meta ads.\n___\n**Best Buy** launched its long anticipated third-party marketplace in the U.S. as of Aug 19, 2025, more than doubling the number of products available through its website and introducing new brands and categories to its assortment. As you might remember, Best Buy previously attempted to run a third-party marketplace in the U.S. from 2011 to 2016, but eventually shut it down because it only brought in 1% of revenue and created confusion among buyers who thought they could return products sold by third-party sellers to Best Buy stores (which they can now do). The marketplace initially has about 500 sellers, which the company says it vetted down to the ones who can provide a high-quality customer experience and match its return policy, with plans to soon introduce licensed sports merchandise with Fanatics.\n___\n**President Trump** called national security and privacy concerns related to **TikTok** and **ByteDance** “highly overrated” on Friday and said that he'll keep extending the deadline for the ban until there's a buyer. To make matters even worse (or better, depending on how you view things)… The White House joined TikTok on Tuesday and began sharing video clips of President Trump and his staff, portraying them as strong and effective American leaders. Meanwhile, China is laughing at America. The CCP published an editorial in the state-owned media outlet China Daily, first applauding the White House for creating an official TikTok account, and then gloating at the inconsistency between the White House's actions and Congress's ban of the app for security reasons.\n___\n**In other TikTok news…** the company denies rumors that the app has been unbanned in India, after brief website access sparked media reports of a possible comeback in the country, more than five years after it was banned. A TikTok representative told TechCrunch, “We have not restored access to TikTok in India and continue to comply with the Government of India's directive.”\n___\nA leaked document obtained by **Adweek** reveals how much major retailers charge advertisers for using their shopper data on **The Trade Desk**, America's largest independent, self-service demand-side platform. The pricing varies by retailer, typically calculated as a percentage of media costs with CPM caps, and often comes with unique requirements on measurement, minimum spends, and ad approval. The Trade Desk couldn’t confirm if the leaked document was internal, but four industry sources told Adweek the pricing details matched their own experiences with the platform. The leaked pricing guide shows how fragmented and retailer-specific The Trade Desk’s retail media costs and rules are, with measurement fees ranging from free to $1 CPM and requirements varying from strict co-branding mandates to flat bans on alcohol and pharmaceutical advertisers.\n___\n**xAI** is taking heat for publicly publishing the chat transcripts of hundreds of thousands of conversations between its chatbot **Grok** and its users, and making them visible and indexable by Google, without the user being explicitly aware. A search for Grok chats shows that Google indexed more than 370,000 user conversations about topics ranging from simple business tasks like writing blogs to attempting to hack into a crypto wallet. Some chats even revealed the name, personal details, and even passwords shared with Grok, as well as image files, spreadsheets, and text documents uploaded by users. If it sounds familiar, it's becuase I've covered almost identical news in recent editions involving OpenAI and Meta AI chats. Both companies fell under scrutiny for allowing literally the exact same thing.\n___\n**Amazon** updated its robots.txt file to block six additional AI-related crawlers from companies including Meta, Google, Huawei, and Mistral, expanding earlier restrictions on bots from Anthropic and Perplexity, as spotted by independent analyst Juozas Kaziukėnas. The move is part of Amazon’s ongoing effort to prevent AI firms from using its product and pricing data to train models or enable shopping tools that could bypass its storefront and threaten its $56B ad business. While robots.txt rules are voluntary and much of Amazon’s data has already been scraped, the company is taking a harder line than rivals like Walmart and eBay, as it develops its own shopping AI tools like Rufus.\n___\n**Omnisend** announced that it will be discontinuing its Product Reviews feature for Shopify merchants as of Sep 19, 2025, which it only launched in April 2024. The company is instead partnering with and recommending that merchants switch to Yotpo, which recently announced that it would be sunsetting its e-mail and SMS marketing platform at the end of the year. While some SaaS companies in the Shopify ecosystem are still pursuing an all-inclusive model, offering features that have traditionally required multiple apps under one roof, others are stepping away from diversifying their feature portfolio to double-down on their core services. The recent moves demonstrate the risk for merchants of putting too many eggs in one app developer's basket.\n___\n**UPS** is offering voluntary buyouts to select U.S. operations managers as it streamlines its network and reduces volume tied to Amazon. Eligible employees can apply between Aug. 26 and Sept. 9, with separations occurring through July 2026 Packages include cash based on tenure, healthcare, and outplacement services. The move follows lower-than-expected attrition from 74 building closures, and comes alongside an existing buyout program for full-time drivers offering $1,800 per year of service with a $10,000 minimum payout.\n___\n**At eBay Open 2025**, sellers said the clear message was that eBay is “all in on AI,” with new tools like AI-powered messaging responses, image-based “magical” listing, and description generators. While many of these features require seller opt-in, eBay is also increasingly inserting AI between buyers and sellers without disclosure, including AI-generated FAQs in search results, description summaries on Facebook Marketplace, and item detail highlights on listing pages. Sellers raised concerns about accuracy, potential “Item Not As Described” claims, and IP risks after eBay revealed it may use AI to strip watermarks from images before sending them to Google.\n___\n**Target** will soon stop fulfilling online orders from many of its stores so that they can refocus teams on improving their drive-up and in-store experiences. Michael Fiddelke, the company's current COO and incoming CEO, told investors that Target stopped some stores in Chicago from fulfilling e-commerce orders as part of a test, diverting those orders to bigger locations, and plans to do the same in 30-40 more markets by the end of the year. The move aims to address concerns that online fulfillment created too many out-of-stock scenarios and hurt customer service. I'm sure the racism related boycotts against the company and its retreat from DEI didn't help either.\n___\n**Hertz** struck a deal with **Amazon** to begin selling pre-owned vehicles on Amazon Autos, starting with customers within 75 miles of Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and Seattle, before expanding to 45 locations nationwide. Shoppers can browse, e-sign paperwork, and complete purchases online, then pick up vehicles at Hertz locations. The deal boosts Hertz’s retail car sales business, which sells hundreds of thousands of vehicles annually, while expanding Amazon’s growing autos platform, which recently added used cars.\n___\n**Elon Musk** tried to get **Mark Zuckerberg** on board of his unsolicited $97.4B offer to purchase the non-profit that controls OpenAI earlier this year, according to court filings made on Thursday, but neither Zuckerberg nor Meta signed the letter of intent or participated in the bid. As part of its filing, OpenAI urged the judge to order Meta to share any documents and communications related to Musk's bid in order to “shed light on the motivations for the bid.” Meta asked the court to deny the subpoena and instead require OpenAI to seek documents directly from Musk.\n___\n**Meta** announced internally that it is splitting its AI division known as Meta Superintelligence Labs into four groups: one to focus on AI research, a second one exclusively for exploring superintelligence, a third one on products, and a fourth on infrastructure like data centers and other AI hardware. How about a fifth for the metaverse? Remember that? LOL. New York Times sources said that the reorganization is likely to be final one for some time and is aimed at better organizing Meta so it can get to its goal of superintelligence and develop AI products more quickly to compete with others.\n___\n**TikTok** is rolling out a new feature called Campus Verification to more than 6,000 universities that is designed to help college students connect with their classmates. How do you like them apples, Meta? The feature invites students to add their graduation year and enter their school e-mail address and then populates a list of other verified student users from their same class for them to follow and connect with. Meta launched a similar concept in 2020 called Facebook Campus, but shut the program down a couple of years later due to quitting everything too soon.\n___\n**Meta** plans to unveil new smart glasses, codenamed Hypernova, at its Connect conference in September, marking its first consumer-ready glasses with a display. The $800 device will feature a small screen in the right lens for displaying simple visual content like messages and will pair with a wristband that interprets neural signals to control the glasses through hand gestures. Alongside Hypernova, Meta will also release a third-generation of its voice-only smart glasses, as it seeks to expand its wearable ecosystem and gather developer support for AI-powered applications.\n___\n**EU officials** are exploring the possibility of issuing its upcoming digital euro on public blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, versus on a closed system as previously expected. Advocates say a public chain could boost adoption and cross-border use of the euro, while critics raise concerns over transparency, since public blockchains record transactions openly. The debate follows the U.S. passage of the Genius Act, which eased the launch of dollar-pegged stablecoins and raised concerns that such tokens could undermine Europe’s financial stability and global influence.\n___\nLast week I shared that **eBay** will begin automatically leaving positive feedback for sellers if they use a tracked service, deliver on time, and no issues are reported. This week Liz Morton of Value Added Resource updated the story to report the counter side to that news, which is that it will also be harder to get certain types of feedback removed. eBay announced that moving forward, if a buyer's comment includes both removable and non-removable content, it'll give the customer the option to edit the removable part so their feedback is published. Additionally, sellers will no longer see automatic removal of negative or neutral feedback in cases involving free returns or partial refund deductions for used or damaged items, potentially leaving sellers vulnerable to abusive buyers.\n___\n**In hires this week…** **Target** named Michael Fiddelke, its current COO, as its next CEO, who will succeed Brian Cornell on Feb 1st. Cornell, who has been at the role since 2014, will transition to executive chair on Target's board of directors. Wow, quite the leadership shakeup. Also **Meta** hired another senior Apple AI engineer named Frank Chu, who will join the company's Superintelligence Labs, despite the division being under a hiring freeze, marking the sixth Apple AI researcher to defect to the company in the past seven weeks. Lastly **OpenAI** poached Sheeladitya Mohanty from Meta, where he led Meta AI and Facebook marketing in APAC, and appointed him their new Marketing Lead for India, as part of the company's attempt to grow engagement in the country.\n___\n**In layoffs this week…** **TikTok** is planning to layoff hundreds of content moderators and security staff in London and Southeast Asia, as it begins to automate more of that work with AI. Meanwhile, speaking of AI, **Cisco** is laying off 221 workers, primarily software engineers, despite a revenue surge and the CEO's claim that AI wouldn't cost jobs. Filings for the layoffs were made on the same day that Cisco announced Q4 earnings that showed revenue was up 8% YoY to $14.7B.\n___\n**X** agreed to settle thousands of cases brought by former employees who sued the company for severance after Elon Musk dismissed them during his 2022 takeover. After acquiring Twitter, Musk reduced its workforce to fewer than 2,000 employees from around 7,500, and a class-action suit filed in 2023 claimed that he owed the fired workers about $500M in severance payments. Musk's legal battle with former senior Twitter executives over $128M in severance payments is continuing however.\n___\n**Samujjal Purkayastha**, a former Meta product manager alleges the company bypassed Apple’s App Tracking Transparency rules by using “deterministic matching” to track users without consent and inflated Shops Ads performance by counting gross sales (which included shipping and taxes) instead of net sales like industry peers, overstating results by up to 19%. The whistleblower, who says he was fired for raising concerns, also claims Meta secretly subsidized ads with a $160M budget authorized by Mark Zuckerberg when testing ways to bypass Apple's rules. The case adds to Meta’s history of bullshitting ad metrics and raises questions about Apple’s ability to enforce its privacy rules.\n___\n**Bonanza** is facing a proposed class action lawsuit alleging that the marketplace allowed third parties to collect personal information from its users through the use of pixel trackers operated by Google, Meta, Microsoft, Klaviyo, Pinterest, and Criteo, in violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act. The lawsuit claims that users didn't consent to the installation or use of the trackers and that Bonanza did not comply with their own posted privacy policy regarding this kind of tracking. It's important to note that the suit is being brought by the law firms Nathan & Associates and Ross Cornell, which filed an almost identical suit against Etsy last month. So while Bonanza have very well copy/pasted their privacy policy from a free privacy policy generation website and have no idea what any of it means, the suit itself could also be bit of a digital ambulance chase. \n___\n**Andrew & William Tate** filed lawsuits against Meta and TikTok for “emotional distress, business interference, and misappropriation” for being kicked off of the platforms in 2022 where they both “commanded an audience of tens of millions, generated significant revenue through lawful online enterprises, and were among the most visible public figures on TikTok's platform.” The brothers, who face rape and sex-trafficking charges in Romania and the U.K and criminal investigations in the U.S., are seeking $50M for themselves and for “the people everywhere who have been lied about, banned, cancelled.” Honestly, fuck the Tate brothers, but I do enjoy and support when Big Tech gets legally challenged, especially over their arbitrary enforcement of ambiguous deplatforming rules. \n___\n**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** A freelance writer named Jolissa Skow discovered that someone was pretending to be her in order to write for a large publication for the past several years!

    "text": "Hi [r/ShopifyeCommerce](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShopifyeCommerce/) \\- I'm Paul and I follow the e-commerce industry closely for my Shopifreaks E-commerce Newsletter. Every week for the past 4 years I've posted a summary recap of the week's top stories on this subreddit, which I cover in depth with sources in the full edition. Let's dive in to this week's top e-commerce news...\n___\n**STAT OF THE WEEK:** More than 50% of adults across the US, UK, Canada, and Australia use Gen AI for e-commerce tasks at least once a month. 65% opt for ChatGPT over Google for tasks like product research, personalized recommendations, and finding deals, according to an Omnisend study.\n___\n**The Trump administration** announced Friday that it has taken a 10% stake in **Intel**, paid for through $5.7B in grants previously awarded to Intel under the 2022 U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, plus $3.2B awarded to the company as part of a program called Secure Enclave, a formerly classified initiative funded by Congress in 2024 that's designed to support the trusted manufacturing of advanced microelectronics for U.S. government and defense use.

Sellers raised concerns about accuracy, potential “Item Not As Described” claims, and IP risks after eBay revealed it may use AI to strip watermarks from images before sending them to Google.\n___\n**Target** will soon stop fulfilling online orders from many of its stores so that they can refocus teams on improving their drive-up and in-store experiences. Michael Fiddelke, the company's current COO and incoming CEO, told investors that Target stopped some stores in Chicago from fulfilling e-commerce orders as part of a test, diverting those orders to bigger locations, and plans to do the same in 30-40 more markets by the end of the year. The move aims to address concerns that online fulfillment created too many out-of-stock scenarios and hurt customer service. I'm sure the racism related boycotts against the company and its retreat from DEI didn't help either.\n___\n**Hertz** struck a deal with **Amazon** to begin selling pre-owned vehicles on Amazon Autos, starting with customers within 75 miles of Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and Seattle, before expanding to 45 locations nationwide. Shoppers can browse, e-sign paperwork, and complete purchases online, then pick up vehicles at Hertz locations. The deal boosts Hertz’s retail car sales business, which sells hundreds of thousands of vehicles annually, while expanding Amazon’s growing autos platform, which recently added used cars.\n___\n**Elon Musk** tried to get **Mark Zuckerberg** on board of his unsolicited $97.4B offer to purchase the non-profit that controls OpenAI earlier this year, according to court filings made on Thursday, but neither Zuckerberg nor Meta signed the letter of intent or participated in the bid. As part of its filing, OpenAI urged the judge to order Meta to share any documents and communications related to Musk's bid in order to “shed light on the motivations for the bid.” Meta asked the court to deny the subpoena and instead require OpenAI to seek documents directly from Musk.\n___\n**Meta** announced internally that it is splitting its AI division known as Meta Superintelligence Labs into four groups: one to focus on AI research, a second one exclusively for exploring superintelligence, a third one on products, and a fourth on infrastructure like data centers and other AI hardware. How about a fifth for the metaverse? Remember that? LOL. New York Times sources said that the reorganization is likely to be final one for some time and is aimed at better organizing Meta so it can get to its goal of superintelligence and develop AI products more quickly to compete with others.\n___\n**TikTok** is rolling out a new feature called Campus Verification to more than 6,000 universities that is designed to help college students connect with their classmates. How do you like them apples, Meta? The feature invites students to add their graduation year and enter their school e-mail address and then populates a list of other verified student users from their same class for them to follow and connect with. Meta launched a similar concept in 2020 called Facebook Campus, but shut the program down a couple of years later due to quitting everything too soon.\n___\n**Meta** plans to unveil new smart glasses, codenamed Hypernova, at its Connect conference in September, marking its first consumer-ready glasses with a display. The $800 device will feature a small screen in the right lens for displaying simple visual content like messages and will pair with a wristband that interprets neural signals to control the glasses through hand gestures. Alongside Hypernova, Meta will also release a third-generation of its voice-only smart glasses, as it seeks to expand its wearable ecosystem and gather developer support for AI-powered applications.\n___\n**EU officials** are exploring the possibility of issuing its upcoming digital euro on public blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, versus on a closed system as previously expected. Advocates say a public chain could boost adoption and cross-border use of the euro, while critics raise concerns over transparency, since public blockchains record transactions openly. The debate follows the U.S. passage of the Genius Act, which eased the launch of dollar-pegged stablecoins and raised concerns that such tokens could undermine Europe’s financial stability and global influence.\n___\nLast week I shared that **eBay** will begin automatically leaving positive feedback for sellers if they use a tracked service, deliver on time, and no issues are reported. This week Liz Morton of Value Added Resource updated the story to report the counter side to that news, which is that it will also be harder to get certain types of feedback removed. eBay announced that moving forward, if a buyer's comment includes both removable and non-removable content, it'll give the customer the option to edit the removable part so their feedback is published. Additionally, sellers will no longer see automatic removal of negative or neutral feedback in cases involving free returns or partial refund deductions for used or damaged items, potentially leaving sellers vulnerable to abusive buyers.\n___\n**In hires this week…** **Target** named Michael Fiddelke, its current COO, as its next CEO, who will succeed Brian Cornell on Feb 1st. Cornell, who has been at the role since 2014, will transition to executive chair on Target's board of directors. Wow, quite the leadership shakeup. Also **Meta** hired another senior Apple AI engineer named Frank Chu, who will join the company's Superintelligence Labs, despite the division being under a hiring freeze, marking the sixth Apple AI researcher to defect to the company in the past seven weeks. Lastly **OpenAI** poached Sheeladitya Mohanty from Meta, where he led Meta AI and Facebook marketing in APAC, and appointed him their new Marketing Lead for India, as part of the company's attempt to grow engagement in the country.\n___\n**In layoffs this week…** **TikTok** is planning to layoff hundreds of content moderators and security staff in London and Southeast Asia, as it begins to automate more of that work with AI. Meanwhile, speaking of AI, **Cisco** is laying off 221 workers, primarily software engineers, despite a revenue surge and the CEO's claim that AI wouldn't cost jobs. Filings for the layoffs were made on the same day that Cisco announced Q4 earnings that showed revenue was up 8% YoY to $14.7B.\n___\n**X** agreed to settle thousands of cases brought by former employees who sued the company for severance after Elon Musk dismissed them during his 2022 takeover. After acquiring Twitter, Musk reduced its workforce to fewer than 2,000 employees from around 7,500, and a class-action suit filed in 2023 claimed that he owed the fired workers about $500M in severance payments. Musk's legal battle with former senior Twitter executives over $128M in severance payments is continuing however.\n___\n**Samujjal Purkayastha**, a former Meta product manager alleges the company bypassed Apple’s App Tracking Transparency rules by using “deterministic matching” to track users without consent and inflated Shops Ads performance by counting gross sales (which included shipping and taxes) instead of net sales like industry peers, overstating results by up to 19%. The whistleblower, who says he was fired for raising concerns, also claims Meta secretly subsidized ads with a $160M budget authorized by Mark Zuckerberg when testing ways to bypass Apple's rules. The case adds to Meta’s history of bullshitting ad metrics and raises questions about Apple’s ability to enforce its privacy rules.\n___\n**Bonanza** is facing a proposed class action lawsuit alleging that the marketplace allowed third parties to collect personal information from its users through the use of pixel trackers operated by Google, Meta, Microsoft, Klaviyo, Pinterest, and Criteo, in violation of the California Invasion of Privacy Act. The lawsuit claims that users didn't consent to the installation or use of the trackers and that Bonanza did not comply with their own posted privacy policy regarding this kind of tracking. It's important to note that the suit is being brought by the law firms Nathan & Associates and Ross Cornell, which filed an almost identical suit against Etsy last month. So while Bonanza have very well copy/pasted their privacy policy from a free privacy policy generation website and have no idea what any of it means, the suit itself could also be bit of a digital ambulance chase. \n___\n**Andrew & William Tate** filed lawsuits against Meta and TikTok for “emotional distress, business interference, and misappropriation” for being kicked off of the platforms in 2022 where they both “commanded an audience of tens of millions, generated significant revenue through lawful online enterprises, and were among the most visible public figures on TikTok's platform.” The brothers, who face rape and sex-trafficking charges in Romania and the U.K and criminal investigations in the U.S., are seeking $50M for themselves and for “the people everywhere who have been lied about, banned, cancelled.” Honestly, fuck the Tate brothers, but I do enjoy and support when Big Tech gets legally challenged, especially over their arbitrary enforcement of ambiguous deplatforming rules. \n___\n**🏆 This week's most ridiculous story…** A freelance writer named Jolissa Skow discovered that someone was pretending to be her in order to write for a large publication for the past several years! The Fake Jolissa had been using her name, bio, photos, writing samples, and even her home address since 2023 and was a regular participant in the company's Slack. The whole time, the entire company was engaging with Fake Jolissa, who never got on camera during meetings, citing a fabricated speech impediment disability that would happen when on camera. Eventually the Real Jolissa found out and contacted the company, which took immediate action — but damn. Background check much?\n___\nPlus 15 seed rounds, IPOs, and acquisitions of interest including **Klaviyo** acquiring **Gatsby**, a social automation platform that helps brands convert interactions like DMs, mentions, tags, and follows into owned customer data like email & SMS subscribers. \n___\nI hope you found this recap helpful.

I already talked about a few, and as I promised, it's Gus Van Sant's turn.\n\nIn his youth, he developed an interest in visual arts (namely, painting and Super-8 filmmaking); while still in school he began making semi-autobiographical shorts costing between 30 and 50 dollars. Van Sant's artistic leanings took him to the Rhode Island School of Design in 1970, where his introduction to various avant-garde directors inspired him to change his major from painting to cinema.\n\nFrom a box office perspective, how reliable was he to deliver a box office hit?\n\nThat's the point of this post. To analyze his career.\n\n#**It should be noted that as he started his career in the 1980s, the domestic grosses here will be adjusted by inflation. The table with his highest grossing films, however, will be left in its unadjusted form, as the worldwide grosses are more difficult to adjust.**\n\n#**Mala Noche (1985)**\n\nHis directorial debut. Based on Walt Curtis' autobiographical novel, the film stars Tim Streeter, Doug Cooeyate, Ray Monge, and Nyla McCarthy. The film follows the relationship between Walt, a gay store clerk, and two younger Mexican boys, Johnny and Roberto Pepper.\n\nThere are no box office numbers, but it was a critically acclaimed project. This helped him open doors.\n\n#**Drugstore Cowboy (1989)**\n\n*\"Sooner or later, someone will pay the price.\"*\n\nHis second film. Based on the autobiographical novel by James Fogle, the film stars Matt Dillon, Kelly Lynch, Heather Graham, James Remar, Max Perlich, Grace Zabriskie, and William S. Burroughs. It follows a group of nomadic drug addicts in 1971 Portland, Oregon.\n\nTom Waits was Van Sant's first choice to play the lead, although the finance company would not support Van Sant if he had cast him. Officially the reason given was that Waits was appearing in another film they were financing, although Van Sant has said he suspected the Oscar win of *Kiss of the Spider Woman*, a film they had also financed, had made them want a lead who could win an Oscar. Dillon was ultimately cast in the role of Bob Hughes. To prepare for his role, Dillon met with active and recovered drug addicts.\n\nThe film did not fare well at the box office. But it earned acclaim from critics, who hailed as one of the best films of the 1980s. It also amassed a cult following, growing in popularity with the years.\n\n- **Budget:** $2,500,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $4,729,352. ($12.3 million adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $4,729,352.\n\n#**My Own Private Idaho (1991)**\n\n*\"Whatever, whatever, have a nice day.\"*\n\nHis third film. Loosely based on William Shakespeare's *Henry IV, Part 1, Henry IV, Part 2*, and *Henry V*, it stars River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves. The story follows two friends, Mike Waters and Scott Favor, as they embark on a journey of personal discovery that takes them from Portland, Oregon, to Mike's hometown in Idaho, and then to Rome in search of Mike's mother.\n\nThe film originated from John Rechy's 1963 novel *City of Night*, which featured street hustlers who did not admit to being gay. Van Sant's original screenplay was written in the 1970s, when he was living in Hollywood. After reading Rechy's book, Van Sant felt it was considerably better than what he was writing, and shelved the script for years. In 1988, Van Sant met street kid Michael Parker, who inspired the character of Mike. Parker also had a friend named Scott, a street kid like himself. In the script, Van Sant made the Scott character a rich kid, also fashioned after street hustlers Van Sant had met in Portland.\n\nVan Sant showed the script to a 20th Century Fox executive who liked Shakespeare. Eventually, he toned down the Shakespearean elements and modernized the language. Van Sant had another script, *The Boys of Storytown*, containing the Mike and Scott characters, as well as Hans and Bob; Van Sant wanted to make the film but felt the script was unfinished.\n\nInitially, no studio would finance the film because of its controversial and offbeat subject matter. After *Drugstore Cowboy* received favorable critical raves and awards, studios started to show some interest, but they all wanted revisions. Frustrated, Van Sant attempted to make the film on a shoestring budget with a cast of actual street kids, including Michael Parker and actor Rodney Harvey, who was going to play Scott.\n\nWhen casting the two central roles, Van Sant sent the script to the agents of Keanu Reeves and River Phoenix, assuming that their agents would reject the script. Reeves's agent was amenable to the project, but Phoenix's would not even show it to him. Van Sant had the idea to get Reeves to personally deliver the film treatment to Phoenix at his home in Florida. Reeves did so during the winter holiday season, riding his 1974 Norton Commando motorcycle from his family home in Canada to the Phoenix family ranch in Micanopy, Florida. After reading the treatment, Phoenix agreed to play Scott, but since Van Sant had already cast Reeves in the role, they had to convince River to take the edgier role of Mike. \n\nVan Sant promised not to make either actor do anything embarrassing. He got an offer of $2 million from an outside investor, but when he delayed production for nine months so that Phoenix could make *Dogfight*, the investor pulled out. Producer Laurie Parker shopped the script around; at the time, New Line Cinema was in the process of branching out into producing arthouse films and decided to back Van Sant's vision with a $2.5 million budget. \n\nDespite only playing in limited theaters, the film was a box office success, earning $8 million worldwide. It also earned critical acclaim, while raising the profiles of Phoenix and Reeves. It is considered a landmark film in New Queer Cinema, growing in popularity and deemed a cult classic, especially among LGBT audiences. \n\n- **Budget:** $2,500,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $6,401,336. ($15.1 million adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $8,101,336.\n\n#**Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (1994)**\n\n*\"There have been many great drivers, but only one great passenger.\"*\n\nHis fourth film. Based on the 1976 novel by Tom Robbins, it stars Uma Thurman, Lorraine Bracco, Angie Dickinson, Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita, Keanu Reeves, John Hurt, and Rain Phoenix. In the film, a woman enters the fashion industry and gets sent to a ranch where she is made to stand in a photo shoot against a background of mating cranes. \n\nThe film was set to be released in the fall of 1993, but was delayed for post-production edits after Van Sant was dissatisfied with the cut screened at the 1993 Toronto International Film Festival. Among the changes Van Sant made were cuts to the New York-set scenes and scenes showing Sissy's relationship with Julian Gitche, in favor of featuring more ranch scenes and focusing more attention on the relationship between Sissy and Bonanza Jellybean. A subplot about the Clock People, who are keepers of the keys to cosmic consciousness and whose presence in the story is signified by the image of the clock on the film's poster, was excised from the final film.\n\nThe film was a big failure at the box office, and it also earned very negative reviews. Van Sant had a big misfire here.\n\n- **Budget:** $8,500,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $1,708,873. ($3.7 million adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $1,708,873.\n\n#**To Die For (1995)**\n\n*\"All she wanted was a little attention.\"*\n\nHis fifth film. Based on the 1992 novel by Joyce Maynard, it stars Nicole Kidman, Joaquin Phoenix, Matt Dillon, Illeana Douglas, Wayne Knight, Casey Affleck, Holland Taylor, Kurtwood Smith, Dan Hedaya, and Alison Folland. The plot follows Suzanne Stone, an ambitious New Hampshire woman with dreams of becoming a celebrity, who will stop at nothing until she achieves fame on TV. \n\nThe book came to the attention of producer Laura Ziskin, who passed it along to Amy Pascal, then an executive vice-president of Columbia Pictures, and the studio bought the rights. Ziskin pitched the film to Van Sant, who himself had been interested in working with screenwriter Buck Henry. The studio envisioned Meg Ryan in the role of Suzanne Stone, but Ryan felt that playing a villainous character would be too edgy for her romantic comedy image at the time. Nicole Kidman, who had been wanting to return to more auteur-driven projects after working in big-budget films like *Days of Thunder* and *Far and Away*, lobbied Van Sant for the role and convinced him she was right for the character. \n\nThe film was a modest success at the box office, and earned critical acclaim. At least Van Sant bounced back.\n\n- **Budget:** $20,000,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $21,284,514. ($45.0 million adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $41,284,514.\n\n#**Good Will Hunting (1997)**\n\n*\"Some people can never believe in themselves, until someone believes in them.\"*\n\nHis sixth film. It stars Matt Damon, Robin Williams, Ben Affleck, Stellan Skarsgård and Minnie Driver, and tells the story of janitor Will Hunting, whose mathematical genius is discovered by a professor at MIT.\n\nMatt Damon started writing the film as a final assignment for a playwriting class that he was taking at Harvard University. Instead of writing a one-act play, Damon submitted a 40-page script. He wrote into his script his then-girlfriend, medical student Skylar Satenstein. Damon said that the only scene from that script to survive verbatim was when Will meets Sean Maguire for the first time. Damon asked Ben Affleck to develop the screenplay with him. They completed the script in 1994. At first, it was written as a thriller about a young man in the rough-and-tumble streets of South Boston who possesses a superior intelligence and is targeted by the government with heavy-handed recruitment.\n\nCastle Rock Entertainment bought the script for $675,000 against $775,000, meaning that Damon and Affleck would earn an additional $100,000 if the film was produced, and they retained sole writing credit. With that said, there were still concerns over the film's tone and premise. Castle Rock president Rob Reiner urged them to drop the thriller aspect of the story and to focus on the relationship between Will and his therapist. However, there is a reference to it in the final script: the scene where Will meets with NSA agents and explains why he doesn't want to work for them. Terrence Malick also told Affleck and Damon over dinner that the film ought to end with Will's decision to follow his girlfriend Skylar to California, not them leaving together.\n\nAffleck and Damon wanted to act in the lead roles, but many studio executives said that they wanted Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. Meanwhile, Kevin Smith was working with Affleck on *Mallrats*, and with both Damon and Affleck on *Chasing Amy*. Castle Rock Entertainment put the script in turnaround and gave Damon and Affleck 30 days to find another buyer for the script who would reimburse Castle Rock Entertainment the money paid; otherwise the script would be reverted to Castle Rock Entertainment, and Damon and Affleck would be out. All of the studios that were involved in the original bidding war for the screenplay turned the pair down, taking meetings with Affleck and Damon only to tell them this to their face.\n\nAs a last resort, Affleck passed the script to Kevin Smith, who read it and promised to walk the script directly into Harvey Weinstein's office at Miramax. Weinstein read the script, loved it, and paid Castle Rock Entertainment their due, while also agreeing to let Damon and Affleck star in the film. \n\nAffleck and Damon found a clever way to choose the right studio for their script. The story goes that on page 60 of the script, they wrote a completely out-of-nowhere sex scene between Sean and Lambeau. They took it to every major studio, and nobody even mentioned the scene. When they met with Weinstein at Miramax, he said, \"I only have one really big note on the script. About page 60, the two professors, both straight men, have a sex scene. What the hell is that?\" Damon and Affleck explained that they put that scene specifically in the script to show them who actually read the script and who didn't. As Weinstein was the only person who brought it up, Miramax was the studio chosen to produce the film.\n\nAfter buying the rights from Castle Rock, Miramax put the film into production. Several well-known filmmakers were originally considered to direct, including Mel Gibson and Michael Mann. Originally, Affleck asked Kevin Smith whether he was interested in directing. He declined, saying that they needed a \"good director\", that he directed only projects that he wrote, and that he was not much of a visual director, but he still served as one of the film's co-executive producers. Damon and Affleck chose Van Sant, whose work on previous films, like *Drugstore Cowboy*, had left a favorable impression on the fledgling screenwriters. Miramax was persuaded and hired Van Sant to direct the film.\n\nThe film started in limited release, but it was clear it had great word of mouth. When it hit wide release, it debuted with $10 million, easily Van Sant's biggest ever debut. With word of mouth on its favor, it held very well, managing to close with $138 million domestically and $225 million worldwide, easily becoming Van Sant's biggest film at the box office. It earned universal acclaim, named by many as one of the greatest films of 1997. It earned 9 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director. It would win two: Best Supporting Actor for Williams, and Best Original Screenplay for Affleck and Damon. These two become the youngest ever to win the award. Van Sant finally got some recognition.\n\nA few years later, Van Sant, Affleck and Damon returned to make *Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season*, which took an action-focused route. It is rumored that Van Sant half-assed the sequel and was more focused on counting his money instead of directing the scenes, but that's not fully confirmed.\n\n- **Budget:** $10,000,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $138,433,435. ($278.2 million adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $225,933,435.\n\n#**Psycho (1998)**\n\n*\"Check in. Relax. Take a shower.\"*\n\nHis seventh film. A remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film, it stars Vince Vaughn, Julianne Moore, Viggo Mortensen, William H. Macy, Robert Forster, Philip Baker Hall, Rance Howard, and Anne Heche. It follows Marion Crane, an embezzler who arrives at an old motel run by a mysterious man named Norman Bates.\n\nVan Sant was a longtime admirer of *Psycho*, and, while a film student, shot a parody commercial for a fictional \"Psycho Shampoo\" brand, which featured a recreation of the 1960 film's shower murder sequence. After the release of *Good Will Hunting*, Universal Pictures agreed to option his proposed remake of the film. Van Sant's pitch was to remake the film shot-for-shot, which Casey Silver, then-head of production at Universal Pictures, felt was \"a very strange idea. The idea of remaking a classic like *Psycho* just seemed like a dangerous business to get into\". When asked why he wanted to remake the film in this manner, Van Sant responded: \"Why not? It's a marketing scheme. Why does a studio ever remake a film? Because they have this little thing they've forgotten about that they could put in the marketplace and make money from.\"\n\nMarion Crane was initially going be played by Nicole Kidman, but she was forced to leave the role due to scheduling problems. Drew Barrymore was also considered for the role before Anne Heche was ultimately cast. Julianne Moore, who was cast as Lila Crane, intentionally chose to portray the character as a more aggressive personality in contrast to Vera Miles's interpretation. William H. Macy chose to stay true to the portrayal of his character Milton Arbogast in the 1960 film, while Vince Vaughn, who played Norman Bates, and Moore interpreted the dialogue and scenes from the original film differently.\n\nVan Sant began with the vision of remaking the film entirely shot-for-shot, stating that he and his crew started out being fanatical about doing it exactly the same, but early into the filming process, realized that doing so was unfeasible: \"There were a couple of scenes we just couldn't get it right. We just couldn't see how Hitchcock did the blocking, where people were supposed to be standing in relation to the camera. So all we could do was loosely base them on the original.\" The film also changed some things, including adding more nudity and graphic violence. Given that it followed the dialogue pretty much step by step, Joseph Stefano, who wrote the original film, was credited as the screenwriter despite the fact that he never worked on the remake.\n\nThe film debuted with a disappointing $10 million, and amidst insanely poor word of mouth, closed with just $21 million domestically and $37 million worldwide. Given its $60 million budget, it was a big box office flop. The film also earned insanely negative reviews, who lambasted pretty much every aspect of the film. Rotten Tomatoes said it best, \"Van Sant's pointless remake neither improves nor illuminates Hitchcock's original.\"\n\nMany questioned the decision to remake *Psycho*, especially a shot-for-shot version. Another criticism was aimed at the very subpar acting, particularly Vaughn and Heche. The characterization also earned criticism, as the film's tone is often conflicting with itself. Screenwriter Joseph Stefano thought that although she spoke the same lines, Heche portrays Crane as an entirely different character. Vant Sant said, \"So it didn’t work. But the idea was whether or not you could remake something and it would repeat the box office. That was the sort of weird science experiment… It’s more important now I think, because people like yourself will ask questions about it. It’s more alive now than it was back when it failed, just with the art world or the modern world.\"\n\nThink about it. Van Sant could've done whatever he wanted with *Good Will Hunting*'s success, and the very first thing he prioritized was a soulless shot-for-shot remake of *Psycho* that cost $60 million. Instead of making something interesting or new, he wasted a whole year on this.\n\n- **Budget:** $60,000,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $21,485,655. ($42.5 million adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $37,170,655.\n\n#**Finding Forrester (2000)**\n\n*\"In an ordinary place, he found the one person to make his life extraordinary.\"*\n\nHis eighth film. It stars Sean Connery, Rob Brown, Anna Paquin, F. Murray Abraham, Michael Pitt, Glenn Fitzgerald, April Grace, Busta Rhymes, and Charles Bernstein. In the film, a teenager, Jamal Wallace, is invited to attend a prestigious private high school. By chance, Jamal befriends a reclusive writer, William Forrester, through whom he refines his talent for writing and comes to terms with his identity.\n\nConnery became interested in the film thanks to his friend John Calley, who was an executive at Sony Pictures, and Connery in turn invited Van Sant to act as director. After that, Connery, Van Sant, and writer Mike Rich together rewrote the original script of Rich. Connery also brought a few of his personal habits to the role, like wearing his socks inside out.\n\nThe film grossed $80 million worldwide, although it wasn't exactly a hit. It received favorable reviews, but stronger audience reception (a rare \"A+\" on CinemaScore). But you might recognize this for the iconic phrase, \"you're the man now, dog!\"\n\n- **Budget:** $43,000,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $51,804,714. ($97.0 million adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $80,049,764.\n\n#**Gerry (2002)**\n\n*\"The desert can be a silent world.\"*\n\nHis ninth film. It stars Matt Damon and Casey Affleck, and follows two hiking companions who both go by the name \"Gerry\". \"Gerry\" is also a slang term, used by both protagonists throughout the misadventure, meaning \"to screw up\".\n\nThe inspiration for the film was the real-life murder of David Coughlin, which Damon related to Van Sant, in which Coughlin and his best friend got lost in the desert, with the latter eventually killing Coughlin. Van Sant deliberately chose not to look up more information on the event because \"we didn't want to do their story,\" instead deciding it would be \"an inspirational aside\".\n\nThe film is notable for its lack of dialogue. Initially Van Sant \"thought we were definitely going to have a lot of long bits of soul-searching dialogue.\" During shooting this never came to pass, and Van Sant asserted that the long silences were \"our version\" of such dialogue. Van Sant wanted the spare dialogue not to cover things for the audience's sake; he explained, \"When [Matt and Casey] are talking, they're just talking and not pointing out stuff that we're supposed to know. If they're talking about something, and we don't know what they're talking about, then that's okay. So long as they know what they're talking about.\" Although the film had a script, it was used as more of an outline, and the team regularly disregarded it. They were unsure of how the film would end if the film was shot in sequence.\n\nThe film flopped at the box office and polarized critics, who debated over whether it was profound or pretentious. Or both?\n\n- **Budget:** $3,500,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $254,683. ($456,647 adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $254,683.\n\n#**Elephant (2003)**\n\n*\"An ordinary high school day. Except that it's not.\"*\n\nHis tenth film. Starring mostly unknown actors, the film is heavily inspired by the 1999 Columbine High School massacre and chronicles the events surrounding a school shooting in Portland, Oregon. The narrative begins a short time before the shooting occurs, following the lives of several characters both in and out of school, who are unaware of what is about to unfold. \n\nThe film began as a documentary that Van Sant had intended to make about the Columbine High School massacre; eventually, the idea of a factual account was dropped. There was no initial script before the filming started. The script was \"written\" to its final form during shooting, with cast members improvising freely and collaborating in the direction of scenes. It was shot over 20 days.\n\nMost of the shots in the film are very long and Steadicam-based. The shot of the three girls walking through the cafeteria is 5 minutes and 19 seconds long. There are only about 88 shots in this film, more than half of them are in the last 20 minutes.\n\nDespite what many critics and analysts have suggested since its release, the final film was not intended to be a pseudo-documentary about the Columbine massacre. While there's no doubt that the film was inspired by the tragedy, Van Sant meant for the film to be more of a reflection on the nature of violence and the effects of indifference.\n\nNow, the title. You already have an idea of what it means, but Van Sant had another idea. The title was based on the 1989 BBC short film of the same name, directed by Alan Clarke, which is set in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Van Sant originally believed Clarke's title referred to the parable of the blind men and an elephant, in which several blind men try to describe an elephant, and each draws different conclusions based on which body part they touched, and Van Sant's film uses that interpretation, as the same general timeline is shown multiple times from multiple viewpoints. But Van Sant discovered Clarke's film referred to the phrase \"elephant in the room\" (the collective denial of some obvious problem).\n\nThe film premiered at the 2003 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Palme d'Or and Best Director. When it hit theaters, it was a box office success. It earned generally positive reviews, but everyone was divided over the film's unconventional narrative and lack of character development. Even to this day, it remains polarizing.\n\n- **Budget:** $3,000,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $1,266,955. ($2.2 million adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $10,012,022.\n\n#**Last Days (2005)**\n\n*\"Rock and roll will never die.\"*\n\nHis 11th film. It stars Michael Pitt, Lukas Haas, Asia Argento, and Scott Patrick Green, and depicts a fictionalized account of the last days of a musician, loosely based on Kurt Cobain. \n\nFor years, Van Sant wanted to do a biographical film about Kurt Cobain but decided against the idea out of concern over the potential of a lawsuit by Cobain's widow, Courtney Love. Van Sant was unsure how Cobain's fans and family would react, so he spoke to Love several times over the years about his project. Though the two became friends and discussed the film for years, Van Sant eventually realized that Love was too devastated by Cobain's death to ever collaborate on the film or allow a biopic.\n\nIt was another box office failure for Van Sant. It also earned polarizing reviews, particularly for its unconventional narrative.\n\n- **Budget:** N/A.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $463,080. ($765,986 adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $2,456,454.\n\n#**Paranoid Park (2007)**\n\nHis 12th film. The film is based on the novel of the same name by Blake Nelson and stars Gabe Nevins and Taylor Momsen. It is the story of a teenage skateboarder set against the backdrop of a police investigation into a mysterious death.\n\nVan Sant chose to adapt the novel into a film because it was set in his hometown of Portland, Oregon, because he was an amateur skateboarder himself and because he found the story particularly interesting. At the time that he first read the novel, he was accumulating the finances for another film, but abandoned the project and decided instead to write a screenplay based on Nelson's story. His first draft of the script was written in two days, and the final draft was just 33 pages long.\n\nLike *Elephant*, Van Sant sought non-professional young actors to play the main roles, and so created a page for the film on MySpace. On the page, he posted an open casting call for males and females aged 14–18 who were \"skaters, honor roll, cheerleaders, punks, drama kids, musicians, artists, student council, athletes, award winners, class skippers, photographers, band members, leaders, followers, shy kids, class clowns\"; a total of 2,971 people auditioned. Most of the actors wore their own clothes and wrote some of their characters' dialogue to maintain a sense of authenticity.\n\nThe film earned highly positive reviews, but was another box office dud.\n\n- **Budget:** $3,000,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $486,767. ($730,361 adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $4,545,747.\n\n#**Milk (2008)**\n\n*\"Never blend in.\"*\n\nHis 13th film. It stars Sean Penn, Emile Hirsch, Josh Brolin, Diego Luna, and James Franco, and follows the life of gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk, who was the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. \n\nIn early 1991, Oliver Stone was planning to produce, but not direct, a film on Milk's life; he wrote a script for the film, called *The Mayor of Castro Street*. In July 1992, Van Sant was signed with Warner Bros. to direct the biopic with actor Robin Williams in the lead role. By April 1993, Van Sant parted ways with the studio, citing creative differences. Rob Cohen was signed to direct the film and wrote a script but Williams decided that the script was not right for him and dropped out. However, WB still planned to produce a film in 1994. Other actors considered for Harvey Milk at the time included Richard Gere, Daniel Day-Lewis, Al Pacino, and James Woods.\n\nIn April 2007, Van Sant sought to direct the biopic based on a script by Dustin Lance Black, while at the same time, Bryan Singer was developing *The Mayor of Castro Street*, which had been in development hell. By the following September, Sean Penn was attached to play Harvey Milk and Matt Damon was attached to play Milk's assassin, Dan White. Damon pulled out later in September due to scheduling conflicts, so Josh Brolin replaced him.\n\nThe film had crazy legs after its limited run, managing to enter the Top 10 with over $1 million despite playing in just 36 theaters. It closed with $31 million domestically and $54 million worldwide, becoming Van Sant's first box office success in a while. It also earned universal acclaim, becoming one of the best films of the year. It earned 8 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director. It wound up winning 2: Best Actor for Sean Penn, and Best Original Screenplay. Van Sant was back.\n\n- **Budget:** $20,000,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $31,841,299. ($47.7 million adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $54,662,930.\n\n#**Restless (2011)**\n\n*\"Who do you live for?\"*\n\nHis 14th film. The film stars Henry Hopper, Mia Wasikowska, Ryō Kase, Schuyler Fisk, and Jane Adams, and follows the romance between Annabel, a terminally ill patient, and Enoch, a young man who copes with the death of his parents by attending funerals.\n\nDespite praise for Wasikowska's performance, the film earned unfavorable reviews and flopped at the box office.\n\n- **Budget:** $8,000,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $163,265. ($234,474 adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $2,518,012.\n\n#**Promised Land (2013)**\n\n*\"What's your price?\"*\n\nHis 15th film. It stars Matt Damon, John Krasinski, Frances McDormand, Rosemarie DeWitt and Hal Holbrook, and follows two petroleum landmen who visit a rural Pennsylvania town in an attempt to buy drilling rights from the local residents.\n\nKrasinski and Damon said that the idea for the film was partially inspired by an investigative series of stories in The New York Times by Ian Urbina, called \"Drilling Down\", about fracking. The screenplay was based on a story by Dave Eggers, and Krasinski came up with the film's premise and developed the idea with Eggers. They pitched the idea to Damon, suggesting that both Damon and Krasinski would write and star in the film. The plan was for Damon to make his directorial debut. In January 2012, Damon stepped down as director due to scheduling conflicts but remained involved with the project. Damon contacted Van Sant, and he joined the project as director.\n\nThe film had a terrible run in limited release and also flopped when it hit wide release, failing to double its opening weekend. It closed with just $7.5 million domestically and $11 million worldwide, another failure for Van Sant. It also earned mixed reviews, with many criticizing the characters and third act.\n\n- **Budget:** $15,000,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $7,597,898. ($10.6 million adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $11,039,031.\n\n#**The Sea of Trees (2015)**\n\n*\"Love will bring you home.\"*\n\nHis 16th film. The film stars Matthew McConaughey, Ken Watanabe, Naomi Watts, Katie Aselton and Jordan Gavaris, and follows an American man who attempts suicide in Aokigahara, an infamous suicide hotspot in Japan, where he meets a Japanese man who is there for the same reason. \n\nIt premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was booed, receiving some of the worst reception in the festival's history. It flopped at the box office and was panned by critics, who deemed it a low point of Van Sant's career.\n\n- **Budget:** $25,000,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $20,444. ($27,864 adjusted)\n\n- **Worldwide gross:** $906,995.\n\n#**Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot (2018)**\n\nHis 17th film. Based upon the memoir by John Callahan, it stars Joaquin Phoenix, Jonah Hill, Rooney Mara, and Jack Black, and follows a recently paralyzed alcoholic who finds a passion for drawing off-color newspaper cartoons.\n\nThe film flopped at the box office. What a surprise. But it earned Van Sant's best reviews in years.\n\n- **Budget:** $3,500,000.\n\n- **Domestic gross:** $1,441,705.

Across those 16 films, he made $489,615,459 worldwide. That's $30,600,966 per film.\n\n#**The Verdict**\n\nUnsurprisingly, he's not reliable.\n\nVan Sant had a brief run where he moved into big studio productions. *Good Will Hunting* was a huge hit, and remains beloved to this day (how do you like them apples?). That gave him a blank check to finally get his *Psycho* remake, which didn't work out. *Finding Forrester* wasn't exactly big, and so his mainstream success was over.\n\nBut here's the thing: Van Sant was never aiming for mainstream audiences. Sure, some hit better than others (like *Milk*), but his approach to filmmaking is way too experimental and unconventional. Outside his brief mainstream run, the only films that achieved a criticallly acclaimed response were *Drugstore Cowboy* and *My Own Private Idaho*. The latter is a very beautiful and devastating film, reminding us how we lost a big talent like River Phoenix.\n\nWhen we say his films are unconventional, is because they're quite inaccessible. Which is why, despite making some acclaimed films, he's still a polarizing filmmaker. You loved *Good Will Hunting*? There's no guarantee you'll like the rest of his works. Films like *Gerry*, *Paranoid Park*, *Restless* and *Last Days* test the viewer's patience due to the film's lack of plot and very minimal character development. But his most controversial film must be *Elephant*; a Palme d'Or winner that doesn't give you any answers nor any reason to truly know the characters, before depicting a horrible school shooting. Some hate it for its lack of plot, non-existent character development, incredibly slow pace and the depiction of the shooting. Yet others love it for those exact same reasons. Where do you fall on it?\n\nAnd so we have to talk about his *Psycho* remake. For all the talk on how 2019's *The Lion King* is shot-for-shot, that's just a nonsensical and baseless argument that can be easily proven wrong because people don't know what \"shot-for-shot\" truly means. Van Sant's *Psycho*, on the other hand, is the definition of shot-for-shot: the exact same shots, the exact same duration, the exact same characters, the exact same dialogues, practically everything. He could've gotten any film after *Good Will Hunting*, and he chose to waste time and money on this. Roger Ebert said it best, \"All that is missing is the tension – the conviction that something urgent is happening on the screen at this very moment.\" I hate the term \"lazy filmmaking\" because every film requires an original thought and determination to do the best film possible... but the *Psycho* remake is the definition of lazy filmmaking. It doesn't improve on the original on anything. It doesn't bring anything notable to the table. It doesn't feel authentic, for it veers deeply into flat imitation. It doesn't offer a single original thought, for everything was pretty much created by Hitchcock and co. back in 1960. It doesn't elicit any emotion, for you don't care about what happens on screen. It doesn't give a single reason why anyone would watch this instead of the original. It doesn't justify its existence. It doesn't... it just doesn't. This was an experiment for something everyone knows. It must've been great for Van Sant and co. to get a few bucks for this, but that doesn't make it any great for anyone who has to sit through it. It's just what it is: lame, pointless, soulless and just unpleasant. An almost similar experience ocurred to me when watching the new *How to Train Your Dragon* remake, but that's a discussion for another day.\n\nNow, Van Sant is obviously experimental and unconventional, so he's always been an acquired taste. But it's good to see him try with whatever he comes up next. Well, everything except that *Psycho* remake. Let's not do something like that ever again. \n\nHope you liked this edition. You can find this and more in the [wiki for this section.](https://www.reddit.com/r/boxoffice/wiki/directors-at-the-box-office)\n\nThe next director will be **Matthew Vaughn**. An incredible case of how a genius fell hard, and will possibly never recover.\n\nThis is the schedule for the following two:\n\nDay | Director | Reasoning\n:-------:|:--------:|----------\nAugust 23 | Matthew Vaughn | The rise and fall.\nAugust 30 | William Wyler | Time for *Ben-Hur*.\n\nDon't ask me what's going on September 6 onwards, for I won't disclose it.",

Memorabilia redemptions are the only unique chase, but they’re extremely rare.\n\nPrice: Costs more than standard mega boxes despite fewer packs and lower overall EV.\n\nLesson: If you’re not chasing memorabilia redemptions, stick to hobby, jumbo, or standard megas—better odds, more packs, and actual chase potential.",

    "text": "\n\nJosh Richter dropped more than $150,000 on three MLB trading cards during a single week in early May. One cost him $85,000: a 2024 Topps Update Rookie Debut Patch Auto (RDPA) 1-of-1 with a Kanji signature of Chicago Cubs pitcher Shota Imanaga.\n\nBut that’s fairly typical for Richter. The 24-year-old deals full-time in high-end cards that he either flips right away because of their instant demand or keeps in his personal collection. His two other purchases that week were a 2022 Topps Chrome Gilded rookie autograph 1-of-1 of Kansas City Royals superstar Bobby Witt Jr. ($50,000) and a 2024 Bowman Draft Sapphire autograph numbered to 5 of Royals rookie Jac Caglianone ($15,000). \n\nRichter—who owns 14 RDPA cards from 2024, which is the top card for a rookie since it contains a game-worn patch from their first MLB appearance—has become a major player in a market filled with experienced collectors and flippers. Even at 24, he holds his own in an industry that’s projected to be valued at $2.75 billion by 2033—a nearly $1.3 billion jump from its 2023 figure.\n\n“It’s a lot of investing and it’s a lot, I guess, gambling in a sense,” San Diego-based Richter tells Front Office Sports. “I’m investing a lot into prospects and some of their best cards to ever be produced and hoping that they pan out to be the Mike Trouts and Ronald Acuñas of the game. Then there’s also a lot of the buying players I just like. … It’s a mix of buying low to hopefully sell high in a short period of time or buy low and sell high in a long period of time.”\n\nMost young collectors aren’t all in on high-end transactions like Richter. But on a smaller scale, interest in trading cards is high among Gen Z and the younger Gen Alpha. They’re particularly on a mission for numbered, rare, and ultra-modern cards, manufactured in the past eight years. \n\nThe chase is on in large part because these young fans have a different portal into collectibles than their predecessors. With more than card shops, Gen Z and Alpha collectors are all in on the massive marketplaces of eBay, Fanatics Collect, and other online shops: a veritable smorgasbord to find exactly what they want—and what others may not even know is out there. And they’re willing to spend.\n\nEzra Levine, CEO of Mascot, a leading trading card marketplace and inventory-management company, estimates thousands of Gen Z and Alpha collectors use the Mascot app—he doesn’t have specific demographic data. (Mascot also supports other types of trading cards, like Pokémon, which are also hugely popular with young collectors.) \n\n“The interest is clearly very high,” Levine tells FOS. “These are tangible, cultural items. The technology and the ability to both transact and engage with them has really increased.” It’s now far easier, he says, “for these kinds of digital native demographics to participate in collectibles.”\n\nAaron Amarant, along with his dad, Mark, opened the AA Mint Cards hobby shop in Cooper City, Fla., in late 2021. Amarant, freshly 23 years old, is now running the successful store. He interacts with Gen Z collectors daily and sees their spending habits firsthand. “A lot of it, no surprise, is driven by what’s hot, social media, pop culture, modern events, stuff like that,” he says. “Then that giant case hit—Kaboom, Downtown chase.”  \n\nThe ultra-modern Kabooms and Downtowns are the most coveted NFL cards from collectibles company Panini. Amarant says young collectors will come into the shop with their parents and beeline to the cases that contain these prizes, hoping they’ll pull the singular one in the lot.\n\nBreaking—where contents of a sealed box or case are split among a group of customers—is also fast-rising among young collectors. They purchase slots, generally a team or specific player, within the break before a box or case is opened live on WhatNot, Fanatics Live, YouTube, Twitch, and other streaming platforms. They receive cards that match the team or player they’ve claimed.\n\n“They’re looking for that ultimate chase card versus when you get a little bit older, [you seek] what’s more meaningful,” Amarant says. “It seems like they just want that excitement of the chase rather than actually collecting to hold on to it long-term.” \n\nAmarant himself is big into Formula 1 cards, which are in relevant infancy with manufacturing giant Topps only breaking into the racing world in 2020. Young collectors are seeking “stuff people aren’t really aware of that we like to hunt for and find,” he says. “They want to find cards with unique stories behind them. At least, for me, that’s what I love, especially in the Formula 1 card space.” \n\nVintage cards—usually considered pre-1970—aren’t on the menu for most Gen Z and Alpha collectors.\n\n“When you hear about legends and older players, I don’t think the right word is boring, but it feels like it’s not relevant. Where you have a player who’s crushing it nowadays in the current market, like a Jayden Daniels or Caleb Williams, you are collecting alongside their career … [and] it feels more relevant,” Amarant says. “You’re investing in their career as it’s going on and then you can reap the rewards if they do well or you can feel the pain with them if they get injured or something like that. It’s closer to almost a fantasy football element than a nostalgia part.”\n\nThat’s the case for Corey Zaslow, who started collecting cards at age 13. Now 16—and with more money to spend—he works at AA Mint and can afford to buy more of what he enjoys: basketball, football, and UFC. His biggest PC is of NBA legend LeBron James. Zaslow owns 10 higher echelon cards from James’s career, including a 2005 Topps Chrome Gold Refractor numbered to 99 (valued at more than $10,000) and a 2006–07 Ultimate Collection Signatures in a BGS 9 with a BGS 10 autograph grade. \n\nHe uses large followings on Instagram, Facebook, and Discord to buy, and says that although he has some big cards in his arsenal, the monetary value isn’t all that important. He agrees there are plenty of young collectors who are in the game as a business, no sentimentality involved. But for his part, Zaslow feels like he’s a true collector—one thing he has in common with collectors past.\n\nhttps://frontofficesports.com/young-collectors-are-on-a-high-stakes-chase-for-ultra-rare-trading-cards/",

Let me know what you think!\n\n**📋 TLDR**\n\nThis week continues to mark major moments for vintage across the board as a Pokémon Snap Bulbasaur card sold for $200,000, reaffirming strength at the ultra-high end (among the other Snap and vintage cards and collections). Meanwhile, modern sealed products like a sleeved case of Team Up packs fetched $29.5k, and the 20th Anniversary Mythical Collection hit $3k, most likely riding the coattails of 25th anniversary hype. A massive $19.1k WOTC-era collection sale is one of several signs that collectors are rotating into vintage amid modern’s boom. In singles, Japanese cards like Karen’s Umbreon from VS and the Zekrom/Reshiram/Victini trio continued to climb, while an incredibly niche grail like the Professor Program Voltorb and a Hidden Legends booster box commanded premium prices. The vintage and modern markets appear to be fueling each other and collectors are paying close attention to both.\n\n**📦 Sealed Product Market Highlight**s\n\n* A sealed case of sleeved Team Up packs (containing 144 packs) recently sold via eBay [auction ](https://www.ebay.com/itm/256981480529?_skw=Pokemon+Sealed+Booster+Box&itmmeta=01K00QSPXVMB8F1Z5F19R1SPZ1&hash=item3bd54a3451:g:h1YAAOSwicZoUxVv&itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAABAFkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cMG%2Fs3JH4eeMAM6jPG%2B1awIvjWPn3RBrrpxvn8bcEJkMT5SDMPtoYHxVwlg0rU3moD5EojUrfm9adVxmPRzTgcV4QTCRmxRDyB4X2OatRkREg5l5RTcCIci3K4uMgqxblsKAyhEX9hz1cT%2FI%2BH0PCGCNVwO8JABxJIipn7DzQwYxSy2xns8ygqsqdYslWhcw7cpuF9Q2PQN7%2F0HdX5NZHXIS45M1ADAyR5UUNo59%2FVd7vhV5f1zhDQ7UrTmvCHV14KO%2Bud7i4avNYa8ij6jwRb2%2Bat6Py%2BM4b%2Fco87P9CzVpuwvj935GEdF82QU4Khsmc%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR5Tv5peAZg)for $29.5k. The top chase cards in this set are the Latias & Latias Tag Team, Gengar & Mimikyu Tag Team, and the Magikarp & Wailord Tag Team. Team Up booster boxes are currently nearing $7k where each booster box contains 36 packs. The 144 sleeved packs equate to 4 booster boxes which would be close to the $29.5k amount paid (It should be noted that sealed products cannot always be equated in this way although it's interesting to note).\n   * What is your opinion on what type of sealed product is best to collect for a set? Or does it not matter as long as it's sealed?\n* Following on the trend of the 25th Anniversary Celebrations collection finding their footing in the market, a complete 20th Anniversary Mythical Pokémon Collection Pin Set recently sold for $3k via eBay [auction](https://www.ebay.com/itm/336056500993?_skw=Pokemon+Sealed+Booster+Box&itmmeta=01K00QSPY10GS0AE8YWCYD25NP&hash=item4e3e874301:g:7RYAAeSwO8xobaHK&itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAABAFkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1fee3xWNFNDA4s%2BzvXD11zozO%2F8vnnEAr%2B3Sbkc7X11f4MliXBKBN15qUlYTSsyzAMMrsuZZjbsjkxIOZXrGn6W4RLNCvhTR2yaw7b8OOmWadDg1dO%2B2I7jHXNNeauq00RVR503AUZObeYgcjYJPuyl2Sool4dCCi44ohQCjpDVOd3h3J%2Bi2xIKeYgS4%2FdvssBLqXcMM7w%2Bsm2W3Y%2BGXofZztf%2B5DfKLkw6%2FPuLefGr4kimFuipu6AW2rwa496sPYpzdC%2BZNw05ndE4mbCzQf20GN67DWpC2hP0C07yz43kY041zZrtC5X8V%2BScCIpAipw%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR7Tv5peAZg) best offer.

This collection includes cards most notably all original shining cards and  from many vintage sets including Base Set, Fossil, Jungle, Neo Destiny, Southern Islands, and more. This type of complete collection, especially for vintage sets, don’t surface at auction that often. This listing included a total of 1041 cards. The seller created a youtube video with a close up of the cards in the [collection](https://youtu.be/iDIjyzc1jRw?si=jKeBJj5-rTmHrt5s).\n   * Collectors are starting to notice a real shift in the vintage Pokémon market, with prices and demand picking up steam as the modern side of the hobby continues to explode. With modern sealed products and singles seeing massive gains, some jumping 150% to 350% in the past year, many are rotating into vintage as a more stable, long-term play. One Redditor put it well: “Demand has surged (likely due to modern collectors shifting into vintage), while low pop supply continues to shrink.” At the same time, content creators and longtime collectors are calling vintage the “pulse of the market,” pointing to its historical significance and lower risk compared to today’s fast-moving modern sets. All this adds up to a growing wave of interest that’s making vintage feel increasingly relevant again. \n* A trio set of the Zekrom, Reshiram, and Victini from Black Bolt and White Flare sold via eBay auction for $3.3k. This sale comes just a couple days after some news which revealed that the Victini card (which was originally only to be included as a Japanese exclusive lottery prize item limited to 2000 copies) will be in English versions of the Black and White sets. There doesn’t seem to be any kind of additional stamp that differentiates the Japanese prize version compared to the English version.\n   * Despite the print quality of Japanese cards being much higher, it’s possible that the price of the Zekrom and Reshiram at least will drop once the English equivalents are on the market as is typical with recent sets.\n* With the recent trend of Japanese exclusive cards seeing huge spikes, Karen’s Umbreon from the Japanese VS set released set in 2001 is seeing a significant jump with recent sales hovering [around](https://www.ebay.com/itm/306372678326?_skw=2001+Pokemon+Japanese+VS+1st+Edition+%2391+Karen%27s+Umbreon+Holo+PSA+10+GEM+MINT&epid=8079153600&itmmeta=01K017JMBSG0PS2X8917R336BR&hash=item47553c12b6:g:UFYAAeSw00NoQxy0&itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAABMFkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cbj0deGCBS%2BW6k4eHrcgG0a1eOdY63Aqbnml9nDjxv38nDY73fm%2BAUferchdXJM81wh5LpInr%2BAWOiw9n5cbJoZUFYK%2F6J4ddCuXTWk1f2udqE%2BERI2zXHiRe3d%2BY68nw3Rsze6wOBJkyiGax9Q%2BPFJP2AkdBbzTEA%2Bqq%2FkN8LfL6zhnkg%2BJffbJ5y3AcITnrSH749eytH%2F4XUrA%2BnyNP0c28Ir%2FS0UQ%2FQdQKyaWL7SWzIn6qb1vDcETgA7eo5AkYN42qxy0IyALXIn4NbR7npjanHPa6jwJHGxmywMXy5rWeGE9pWnmuKtHwvKFMMOGk4Wzy0exVl9OMf44Xzi%2BsiJAZuqryzUdZk44C8Xm0KNkWM0Vduv3fW7rAK4w4GPlo%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR47GyqeAZg) $5.5-6k\n   * Will Karen’s Tyranitar (or any other of Karen’s Pokemon for that matter) ride this wave to reach similar heights at some point?\n\n**🕰️ Vintage & Niche Market Highlight**s\n\n* Multiple Pokemon Snap cards sold via Fanatics auction in the past week and a half. Most notably a copy of the Bulbasaur snap card [sold ](https://www.fanaticscollect.com/fixed/c4f41192-59a2-11f0-98d6-0af90ac75379)for $200,000. For anyone not familiar with the Pokemon Snap cards:\n   * The Pokémon Snap Prize cards are among the rarest and most iconic pieces of Pokémon TCG history. Originally awarded in 1999 through a unique contest run in Japan via the Nintendo 64 game *Pokémon Snap*, players submitted in-game photographs to be judged. Winners received custom-printed cards featuring their snapshot artwork, printed in incredibly limited numbers (often estimated at just 20 copies per winner). These cards—feature some of the most popular Pokémon in the TCG like Pikachu, Magikarp, and Gyarados.\n   * The market for incredibly rare and high end vintage cards is still incredibly strong when they surface in the market. Other notable sales of Snap cards include:\n      * Gyarados [sold](https://www.fanaticscollect.com/fixed/766ccdf8-59a6-11f0-86c0-0a58a9feac02) for $150k\n      * Articuno [sold](https://www.fanaticscollect.com/fixed/f6745438-d0cd-11ef-8661-0a58a9feac02) for $100k\n      * Chansey [sold](https://www.fanaticscollect.com/fixed/de78cfe6-59a6-11f0-9a83-0a58a9feac02) for $150k\n* A sealed booster box of the Hidden Legends set released in 2004 recently sold via eBay [auction ](https://www.ebay.com/itm/205605569493?nordt=true&rt=nc&customid=noId&toolid=10001)best offer at $11.5k from an original listing price of $19.99k. The top chase cards in this set are the Groudon, Ninetales, and Regi trio ex cards which are hovering around $1k.\n   * As with other vintage and modern sets this set is also seeing incredible growth in value despite limited price data. One question that sometimes comes up with sets like this is why the booster boxes are so expensive despite the top chase cards not coming anywhere close to the value of the booster box even in a PSA 10. This is by no means a profound or otherwise revealing answer, but there are generally several factors that go into it such as the shrinking supply of the sealed product itself considering the age. It’s also that scarcity as well as the potential of pulling a top chase card that encourages growth and demand.\n* A copy of the cosmos holo version of the Professor Program Voltorb recently sold via eBay [auction](https://www.ebay.com/itm/357162076580?_skw=Pokemon+Card&epid=21062927842&itmmeta=01K00R4KWJMR3XGYZ4K10NR0ER&hash=item532884c9a4:g:gsAAAeSwl8loWORU&itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA8FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cDwSIEwMWADUrnT2kOCW8AOMQ3%2BJwTz1cxoFNkQT1L%2F9IcZb61Q5D6gPgWF9%2Bm9%2B4sAhATDeAflKwYB7NXa8hfNmJEJIVzWdoV76Ox72D0zR74OPh%2FhdQw46FdXABmmZiqaGV5%2FhrGwNxuJnM%2FLA9QDtWClo8b3%2BOdsJlcv3zGpwAjovTAt3bKnWseNnJLkjcf54nohYrf3zaqx2qwy6hXsV3hg6TbWamIS%2Bowgg5Y2I%2F%2BIKbGNF70xCKdF2%2ByEV%2Bme4hQKuW4%2Bx4F7SL0RolXTonNJpzUByheAcDG0IpXCA%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR9a-kpiAZg) in a PSA 9 for $15k.\n   * This particular Voltorb card is an extremely rare Pokémon TCG promo card from the 151 set, given to head mentors at the 2024 North American International Championships (NAIC) as part of the Professor Program. Only 12 of these Cosmos holo versions were ever produced, making it one of the rarest English cards ever printed.\n\n⌛**Pokemon Time Machine**\n\n*Might not be directly card related*\n\n* In 2020, a hand drawn and signed original art of Pichu by Ken Sugimori, sold at Goldin [auction ](https://goldin.co/item/2006-ken-sugimori-pokemon-pichu-original-hand-drawn-and-signed-drawing3v0wn?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMzllZDhlZjc4MDIwMGZmZjJlMjlmMmEwNDNiZGVhZjciLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjl9)for $45,000 (with the added buyer’s premium the buyer ultimately paid $54,000).\n\n**📚 Educational Commentary – Collector’s Corne**r\n\n*What is a “shadowless” card — and why do Base Set print variations matter so much?*\n\nWhen Pokémon cards were first printed in English in 1999 the earliest print run was 1st Edition Shadowless, identifiable by a 1st Edition stamp and the absence of a drop shadow around the Pokémon portrait box. Shortly after, Shadowless Unlimited cards were printed and these cards had no 1st Edition stamp but still lacked the shadow. Finally, the standard Unlimited Base Set added the now-familiar shadow behind the portrait box.\n\nCollectors prize these early variants for several reasons:\n\nScarcity: 1st Edition and Shadowless prints were limited, especially compared to the mass-printed Unlimited version.\n\nHistorical significance: These were the very first English Pokémon cards ever printed, making them a milestone in TCG history.\n\nImportantly, these print distinctions have massive implications for value. A PSA 10 Base Set Charizard from each print run can range from: $15k–$20k for Unlimited, $60k+ for Shadowless, and $150k–$300k+ for 1st Edition Shadowless.\n\n**🫐 Berries For Though**t\n\n**💭 What are your thoughts on collecting other Pokemon collectible items in addition to cards such as sealed games or original artwork**?\n\n**💭 When do you decide to invest in modern vs vintage cards or sealed products**?",

There doesn’t seem to be any kind of additional stamp that differentiates the Japanese prize version compared to the English version.\n   * Despite the print quality of Japanese cards being much higher, it’s possible that the price of the Zekrom and Reshiram at least will drop once the English equivalents are on the market as is typical with recent sets.\n* With the recent trend of Japanese exclusive cards seeing huge spikes, Karen’s Umbreon from the Japanese VS set released set in 2001 is seeing a significant jump with recent sales hovering [around](https://www.ebay.com/itm/306372678326?_skw=2001+Pokemon+Japanese+VS+1st+Edition+%2391+Karen%27s+Umbreon+Holo+PSA+10+GEM+MINT&epid=8079153600&itmmeta=01K017JMBSG0PS2X8917R336BR&hash=item47553c12b6:g:UFYAAeSw00NoQxy0&itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAABMFkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cbj0deGCBS%2BW6k4eHrcgG0a1eOdY63Aqbnml9nDjxv38nDY73fm%2BAUferchdXJM81wh5LpInr%2BAWOiw9n5cbJoZUFYK%2F6J4ddCuXTWk1f2udqE%2BERI2zXHiRe3d%2BY68nw3Rsze6wOBJkyiGax9Q%2BPFJP2AkdBbzTEA%2Bqq%2FkN8LfL6zhnkg%2BJffbJ5y3AcITnrSH749eytH%2F4XUrA%2BnyNP0c28Ir%2FS0UQ%2FQdQKyaWL7SWzIn6qb1vDcETgA7eo5AkYN42qxy0IyALXIn4NbR7npjanHPa6jwJHGxmywMXy5rWeGE9pWnmuKtHwvKFMMOGk4Wzy0exVl9OMf44Xzi%2BsiJAZuqryzUdZk44C8Xm0KNkWM0Vduv3fW7rAK4w4GPlo%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR47GyqeAZg) $5.5-6k\n   * Will Karen’s Tyranitar (or any other of Karen’s Pokemon for that matter) ride this wave to reach similar heights at some point?\n\n**🕰️ Vintage & Niche Market Highlights**\n\n* Multiple Pokemon Snap cards sold via Fanatics auction in the past week and a half. Most notably a copy of the Bulbasaur snap card [sold ](https://www.fanaticscollect.com/fixed/c4f41192-59a2-11f0-98d6-0af90ac75379)for $200,000. For anyone not familiar with the Pokemon Snap cards:\n   * The Pokémon Snap Prize cards are among the rarest and most iconic pieces of Pokémon TCG history. Originally awarded in 1999 through a unique contest run in Japan via the Nintendo 64 game *Pokémon Snap*, players submitted in-game photographs to be judged. Winners received custom-printed cards featuring their snapshot artwork, printed in incredibly limited numbers (often estimated at just 20 copies per winner). These cards—feature some of the most popular Pokémon in the TCG like Pikachu, Magikarp, and Gyarados.\n   * The market for incredibly rare and high end vintage cards is still incredibly strong when they surface in the market. Other notable sales of Snap cards include:\n      * Gyarados [sold](https://www.fanaticscollect.com/fixed/766ccdf8-59a6-11f0-86c0-0a58a9feac02) for $150k\n      * Articuno [sold](https://www.fanaticscollect.com/fixed/f6745438-d0cd-11ef-8661-0a58a9feac02) for $100k\n      * Chansey [sold](https://www.fanaticscollect.com/fixed/de78cfe6-59a6-11f0-9a83-0a58a9feac02) for $150k\n* A sealed booster box of the Hidden Legends set released in 2004 recently sold via eBay [auction ](https://www.ebay.com/itm/205605569493?nordt=true&rt=nc&customid=noId&toolid=10001)best offer at $11.5k from an original listing price of $19.99k. The top chase cards in this set are the Groudon, Ninetales, and Regi trio ex cards which are hovering around $1k.\n   * As with other vintage and modern sets this set is also seeing incredible growth in value despite limited price data. One question that sometimes comes up with sets like this is why the booster boxes are so expensive despite the top chase cards not coming anywhere close to the value of the booster box even in a PSA 10. This is by no means a profound or otherwise revealing answer, but there are generally several factors that go into it such as the shrinking supply of the sealed product itself considering the age. It’s also that scarcity as well as the potential of pulling a top chase card that encourages growth and demand.\n* A copy of the cosmos holo version of the Professor Program Voltorb recently sold via eBay [auction](https://www.ebay.com/itm/357162076580?_skw=Pokemon+Card&epid=21062927842&itmmeta=01K00R4KWJMR3XGYZ4K10NR0ER&hash=item532884c9a4:g:gsAAAeSwl8loWORU&itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA8FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1cDwSIEwMWADUrnT2kOCW8AOMQ3%2BJwTz1cxoFNkQT1L%2F9IcZb61Q5D6gPgWF9%2Bm9%2B4sAhATDeAflKwYB7NXa8hfNmJEJIVzWdoV76Ox72D0zR74OPh%2FhdQw46FdXABmmZiqaGV5%2FhrGwNxuJnM%2FLA9QDtWClo8b3%2BOdsJlcv3zGpwAjovTAt3bKnWseNnJLkjcf54nohYrf3zaqx2qwy6hXsV3hg6TbWamIS%2Bowgg5Y2I%2F%2BIKbGNF70xCKdF2%2ByEV%2Bme4hQKuW4%2Bx4F7SL0RolXTonNJpzUByheAcDG0IpXCA%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR9a-kpiAZg) in a PSA 9 for $15k.\n   * This particular Voltorb card is an extremely rare Pokémon TCG promo card from the 151 set, given to head mentors at the 2024 North American International Championships (NAIC) as part of the Professor Program. Only 12 of these Cosmos holo versions were ever produced, making it one of the rarest English cards ever printed.\n\n⌛**Pokemon Time Machine**\n\n*Might not be directly card related*\n\n* In 2020, a hand drawn and signed original art of Pichu by Ken Sugimori, sold at Goldin [auction ](https://goldin.co/item/2006-ken-sugimori-pokemon-pichu-original-hand-drawn-and-signed-drawing3v0wn?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMzllZDhlZjc4MDIwMGZmZjJlMjlmMmEwNDNiZGVhZjciLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjl9)for $45,000 (with the added buyer’s premium the buyer ultimately paid $54,000).\n\n**📚 Educational Commentary – Collector’s Corner**\n\n*What is a “shadowless” card — and why do Base Set print variations matter so much?*\n\nWhen Pokémon cards were first printed in English in 1999 the earliest print run was 1st Edition Shadowless, identifiable by a 1st Edition stamp and the absence of a drop shadow around the Pokémon portrait box. Shortly after, Shadowless Unlimited cards were printed and these cards had no 1st Edition stamp but still lacked the shadow. Finally, the standard Unlimited Base Set added the now-familiar shadow behind the portrait box.\n\nCollectors prize these early variants for several reasons:\n\nScarcity: 1st Edition and Shadowless prints were limited, especially compared to the mass-printed Unlimited version.\n\nHistorical significance: These were the very first English Pokémon cards ever printed, making them a milestone in TCG history.\n\nImportantly, these print distinctions have massive implications for value. A PSA 10 Base Set Charizard from each print run can range from: $15k–$20k for Unlimited, $60k+ for Shadowless, and $150k–$300k+ for 1st Edition Shadowless.\n\n**🫐 Berries For Thought**\n\n**💭 What are your thoughts on collecting other Pokemon collectible items in addition to cards such as sealed games or original artwork?**\n\n**💭 When do you decide to invest in modern vs vintage cards or sealed products?**",

    "text": "I saw Gone With The Wind...\n\nLook, Gone With the Wind is one of those movies that people used to treat like this grand, tragic epic about love and loss and war and nowadays has a very controversial reputation because of how values have changed over time. But when you watch it now, with even a shred of historical awareness, it’s honestly one of the funniest unintentional comedies ever made.\n\nLike, it’s so clearly Southern propaganda that it feels like watching a 4 hour Confederate fanfiction with a blockbuster budget. The movie depicts Southern aristocrats portrayed as noble, misunderstood victims while they sip tea in mansions built by slavery. Meanwhile, slavery itself is presented like it was some cozy internship program with matching uniforms. It’s wild. \n\nThe Confederacy, of course, is depicted just a bunch of dashing, gallant gentlemen defending their \"way of life\", no mention of what that way of life actually was. Just vague nonsense about \"the cause\" while completely downplaying the part where their economy ran on human ownership. But sure, Scarlett is mad about Yankees burning the Wilkes's plantation. So tragic.\n\nScarlett O’Hara is out here being an absolute cunt to everyone around her and somehow we’re supposed to admire her resilience? When in fact she’s a chaotic spoiled rich girl LARPing as a survivor while the movie plays swelling music every time she argues about love or something with Rhett Butler. And the slaves. Oh lord, the slaves. Just caricatures, comic relief, or loyal sidekicks with zero agency because you know, they're slaves. It’s like the film tries so hard to convince us that everyone was just happy with the arrangement. It’s straight up fantasy it's hilarious.\n\nAnd the funniest part? The movie tries so hard to make the Union army, you know, the ones literally fighting to end slavery,  seem like this monstrous, brutal invading force. Like Sherman’s March is framed like a horror movie where a monster is gonna arrive. The music gets dark, people are screaming, everything's burning... Oh no, the big bad Yankees are coming to destroy our lovely, plantation filled utopia!\n\nBut here's the wild part, the actual worst destruction we see in the film isn’t even directly caused by Sherman’s army. It’s from Southerners themselves, fleeing, torching their own supplies, trampling over each other in desperation. The real depiction of collapse and disorder was from the Confederates panicking and crumbling under the pressure, not some cartoonishly evil Northern juggernaut. \n\nIt’s like the movie accidentally undermines its own Lost Cause narrative by showing that the Confederacy was already eating itself alive. All while it’s desperately trying to play epic music over a burning Atlanta skyline like we’re supposed to cry over the fall of a society built on human bondage.  Gone With the Wind wants you to believe in a tragic Southern Camelot destroyed by cruel Northerners. But the story it actually tells, if you watch without the rose colored glasses, is one of a doomed, exploitative system collapsing under its own hypocrisy, while its so called \"rebels\" self destruct. And that irony? That’s what makes it unintentionally hilarious.\n\nOh my God, the funniest moment in the entire movie, hands down, is that absurd, tone deaf opening. You get this sweeping, whimsical score like you're about to watch The Sound of Music or some heartwarming family adventure. The music is all triumphant and magical... and then cut straight to enslaved Black people working in the fields.\n\nBut wait... it gets better.\n\nLater in the movie, there’s this rich as hell Southern lady who straight up complains about a bride auction and whines, “This feels like a slave auction!” Yes, she really did say that. Ma’am. Ma’am. You live in a plantation house built by slaves, surrounded by slaves, sipping on lemonade probably made by a slave, and you’re mad that a man is bidding on a date? That is some Olympic level lack of self awareness. The line isn’t even meant to be ironic! It’s played totally straight! The writers genuinely didn’t see the contradiction, or worse, thought it was clever.\n\nOh and let’s talk about this slave named Prissy, because wow. Every time she opens her mouth she sounds less “epic Civil War drama” and more \"Looney Tunes character\". Like, what was even the direction there? You can’t help but laugh not at her, but at how ridiculous and patronizing the character is. It's painfully obvious she was written by someone whose idea was just turning a Black woman into a walking stereotype with the voice of a Hanna Barbera sidekick. It’s surreal. You’ve got cannon fire, burning cities, melodrama everywhere… and in the middle of it all is Prissy going “I don’t know nothin’ ‘bout birthin’ no babies!” like she’s talking to Tom & Jerry. This was meant to be emotional tension. Like this was the moment where Scarlett is supposed to freak out. But it just rips you right out of it because Prissy sounds like she belongs in a Tex Avery short, not a Best Picture winning historical epic.\n\nThere's a scene where Scarlet O'Hara threatens to whip Prissy and then hits her, my thoughts are “Wait… we’re supposed to be rooting for this woman??”. Scarlett O’Hara straight up slaps Prissy, yells at her, treats her like garbage throughout the movie and the narrative just glides right past it like that’s perfectly normal behavior for our “heroine.” It’s framed like, “Oh, poor Scarlett, look at all she’s going through!” Meanwhile she’s backhanding a teenage girl who’s terrified and hungry in the middle of a literal warzone. \n\nAnd then later, when Prissy is whining about being starving, as one might reasonably do while, you know, starving,  Scarlett’s like “SHUT UP PRISSY” as if she’s tired of her ruining everything. And the audience is clearly expected to side with Scarlett, like Prissy’s the one being difficult. What?? How?? You're literally yelling at the enslaved girl for being hungry during a siege, Ma’am. To no surprise, the movie conveniently ignores the fact that Scarlet's entire arc is built on stepping on the backs of people she treats like trash. Especially Prissy. And the tone of the movie never questions it. It never says, “Hey… maybe this Southern belle is actually kind of awful.”  And we’re supposed to like her? Watching it now with modern eyes, it’s like watching Regina George be the lead in a war epic but worse, because Scarlett’s cruelty is directed at enslaved people, and the film wants us to chalk it up to her being “fiery” or “headstrong.” Give me a break lmao.\n\nBefore Prissy got the Will Smith treatment from Scarlet, Scarlet was told she has to take care of Melanie who's sick and pregnant and when Scarlet suggests they try to seek refuge, she's being told she has to take care of Melanie with Prissy offering to help her. Yeah that's a good idea during a warzone, staying instead of both Scarlet and Melanie seeking safety. Scarlett, to her credit, is like, “Hey, maybe we should not stay here in a literal warzone while Atlanta is falling apart around us, people are starving, and Union troops are marching into town.” Like... a completely reasonable suggestion.\n\nBut what’s the response? “No, Scarlett, you can’t leave. You must stay and take care of Melanie. She’s sick and about to give birth.” And then Prissy chimes in like, “Don’t worry Miss Scarlett, I’ll help!” And then literally just said five minutes later that she said she don’t know anything about delivering babies. And we’re trusting the life of a very pregnant woman and a barely holding it together Scarlett to a teenager who clearly is just trying to survive like the rest of us?? You’re in a collapsing city! The roads are right there! FLEE. GET OUT. But nope, plot demands that Scarlett stay behind to suffer some more and yell at Prissy while the South burns. And honestly, it’s kind of wild how the movie sets up that situation to make Scarlett look like she’s being selfish for wanting to escape, like, “Oh Scarlett, always thinking of yourself…” Ma’am. She’s thinking about not dying.  \n\nAlso one of the absolute funniest things in Gone With the Wind is how half the cast doesn’t even sound Southern. Like, this is supposed to be the epic, definitive portrayal of the antebellum South, right? A grand cinematic tribute to “Southern heritage” and yet half these people sound like they’re from Connecticut.\n\nScarlett O’Hara does not even remotely a Southern drawl most of the time, it’s more like “Mid Atlantic Drama School English.” Clark Gable straight up didn’t even try. The man sounds like he walked off the set of a gangster film and just happened to stumble into Georgia. He could’ve said “Frankly, my dear” with a Brooklyn accent and no one would’ve noticed because it already didn’t fit.\n\nIt’s so unintentionally hilarious because it completely breaks the illusion. You’re watching this heavily romanticized portrayal of the Old South, with its grand plantations and moonlight and magnolias and then someone opens their mouth and they’re like, “I do declare!” but it sounds like they declare from a prep school in Massachusetts. It’s like if a WWII movie set in France had all the actors talk in perfect California surfer slang.  That’s how jarring it is.\n\nAnd what makes it even better is that the only characters who consistently have Southern accents… are the slaves. Because of course. Of course the movie makes sure the dialects are “authentic” for the Black characters so they can exaggerate and caricature them, but they don’t bother holding the main characters to the same standard. That tells you everything you need to know about where the priorities were.\n\nThis is the highest grossing film of all time (adjusted for inflation!) and it’s glorified fanfiction for the Confederacy. A wildly melodramatic, emotionally whiplashing epic where the heroine is basically a self centered, manipulative bitch in a hoop skirt and we’re just supposed to be charmed by it.\n\nScarlett O’Hara isn’t just “flawed.” She’s a trainwreck, and in the fun way. She’s rude to everyone, whines constantly, emotionally abuses the one man who actually loves her, and straight up slaps a slave. But sure, let’s build a four hour film around her tragic heartbreak. Boo hoo, your crush doesn’t like you. The South’s literally burning down, Scarlett.\n\nAnd the wildest part is that America ate it up. This movie has been hailed as a classic for decades. People still use “Frankly, my dear” like it’s some Shakespearean quote. Meanwhile, the film is basically Confederate cosplay with extra melodrama and bad accents. The fact that it’s the highest grossing film ever (again, adjusted for inflation) says a lot about what kind of myths people wanted to comfort themselves with in the 20th century. Gone With the Wind is not just propaganda, it’s glamorized, so bad it's funny propaganda led by a character who honestly wouldn’t be out of place on a Bravo reality show. And I love it. \n\n\n\n",

Found eBay has been great for low value to mid value sales. What's the general consensus for selling cards via auction that are 4 or 5 figures in value? Fanactic's seems to be seller friendly with their commission bonuses. Anything to look out for? Goldin seems to have name recognition for high value cards, but not so transparent with their sales commission/fee structure.

    "text": "Hey folks,\nMy mother collected beanie babies throughout the 90s and wants to move on from the collection. She hasn't added to it in years and is just looking for an easy way to move them & bring a reasonable return. Many of them were bought via eBay and I know that is still a primary option for selling these. But we're also keen on the fact that if we sell them ourselves, that's a time consuming process. I was pretty surprised when I searched this sub for auction house information but nothing came back.\n\n*Are there any other auction houses that have a strong following within the community? How about well respected vendors that take them on consignment?*\n\nI know auction houses like Goldin have sold a handful whereas Heritage doesn't even seem to touch them. Figured this would be a good question for you all.\n\nThanks for your time,\nBSF\n\nPS - please don't send PMs  - I use RedReader and checking messages isn't really easy to do unless i'm on desktop (which I'm rarely on).",

My grandpa only mentioned his comics a couple times but never said anything about how rare some of them are. We never knew what he had until he passed.

    "text": "[“Hunting and shooting sports are woven into the fabric of Idaho’s history with generations of sportsmen and women passing down hunting traditions from father to son, mother to daughter. This is a legacy we must uphold and protect,” said Risch. “This legislation will make important updates to the Pittman-Robertson Fund to ensure future generations can carry on this treasured pastime of hunting and recreational shooting while conserving wildlife for outdoorsmen and women to enjoy and experience.”](https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2019/7/risch-reintroduces-legislation-to-promote-hunting-tradition-strengthen-access-to-recreation)\n\n[Senator Crapo's article about conserving our lands for future generations and wildlife preservation](https://www.crapo.senate.gov/media/columns/hunting-and-fishing-an-idaho-and-american-heritage). He even begins the article by quoting Theodore Roosevelt \"I recognize the right and duty of this generation to develop and use natural resources of our land; but I do not recognize the right to waste them, or to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come after us\"\n\nDo not let them take back their word for the sake of a tax break.\n\nThis is my letter to them:\n\nAs your constituent and native Idahoan, I am writing to express my deep concern about the proposed Senate Reconciliation Bill. I urge you to do everything in your power to oppose it in its current form. \n\nOne of the most alarming provisions would allow for the disposal of up to 3 million acres of public Idaho land that belongs to us. These public lands are not excess property to be auctioned off to the highest bidder. They are our shared heritage valued by local communities, Indigenous Tribes, and future generations.\n\nI am also strongly opposed to the other provisions in the bill that would allow for oil lease sales in the Arctic Refuge, mining roads in the Arctic National Park, and a significant increase in logging in the western national forests. The destruction of fragile ecosystems has long-term consequences that go beyond the immediate loss of land. Irreversible diversity loss, disruption to water and climate systems, increased wildfires, increased disease, and undermines food security. Healthy ecosystems are vital to local economies and cultural traditions. Once these places are gone, we cannot get them back and the cost of this loss will be paid by generations to come. \n\nSenator Risch- in 2019 you reintroduced legislation to promote hunting traditions and to strengthen access to recreation. I value your recognition when you said \"hunting and shooting sports are woven into the fabric of Idaho's history\" and your support for conservation funding to ensure future generations can enjoy these traditions.  I too believe we have a responsibility to protect wildlife and preserve access to healthy public lands. \n\nSenator Crapo- I appreciate your longstanding commitment to Idaho's outdoor heritage, most notably in your 2009 column \"Hunting and Fishing: An Idaho and American Heritage,\" in which you strongly expressed value in how sportsmen and landowners have helped conserve wildlife, waters, and forests for our future generations. Like you, I value that the responsible management of our public lands ensures healthy wildlife, clean water, and a meaningful outdoor experience for our future generations. \n\nPlease do not take back your word and undermine your own stated values for the sake of a tax break. This plan is shortsighted, irresponsible, and does not meaningfully address our national budget. Please vote no on this bill.",

I am looking forward to participating in the next **Numismatik Naumann** auction (I will be bidding on some Roman denarii struck in Rome, so hopefully they are not counted as cultural heritage of Spain upon import). The house is based in Austria. I want the coins to be shipped to me here in Spain. Is there anything I should be on look out for before doing so? What might be the issues with importing Ancient coins to Spain from Austria?

Does that mean X grade is not actually able to recognize all the small issues? Or does that get added by the human grader reviewing?",

Also, I couldn't find the COA or any paperwork anywhere (except the receipt) which is frustrating because I know he had them somewhere.\n\nAh, anyway.

    "text": "In order (where I bought it; for how much I bought it (CAD), not including shipping or tax; my personal history with it and/or how much I like it):\n\n1. Used Pro Adidas Centennial 'O': purchased this year off of an eBay auction for $30. I absolutely love the silver on this, love the centennial shoulder patch, and love the embossed Stanley Cup championship years on the sleeves. Definitely a favourite, very clean.\n2. Almost brand new original \"swoosh\" CCM Senagoth jersey, before the Senagoth found eyeliner: purchased this year off of Facebook Marketplace for $50. Love the \"swoosh\", love the less aggressive \"sans-eyeliner\" Senagoth, and love the 2D Sens logo shoulder patches a lot better than I thought I would. Solid, well worth the two hours I took out of my day to journey to far Montreal North to get it.\n3. Basically brand new CCM black alternate Senagoth jersey: purchased this year off of Facebook Marketplace for $120. My favourite of the bunch (at least until I get my hands on a Sens RR 1.0, but even then)... everything about this one is just AWESOME! While I usually find the Senagoth a bit much, here on the solid black it's perfect. The Peace Tower + Maple Leaf shoulder patches are fantastic; but it's the golden laurel pattern on the sleeves and torso that make this jersey perfect for me. Wore it for Ottawa's crushing 4-0 defeat against Toronto, so it is now officially a lucky jersey (nevermind that I wore it for their series loss, too).\n4. Used Premier Reebok Daniel Alfredsson red jersey: purchased this year off of Facebook Marketplace for $75. I never realized that the 3D Sens logo sparkled so much on these bad boys!! As a Sens fan, I had to have an Alfie jersey in the mix, and it makes up for my mistake several years ago when I let go an Alfie jersey for cheap at an Ottawa Value Village. Must say that seeing this jersey against the others makes me realize that this logo + jersey is my least favourite of the bunch. It's just kind of meh. Still love it though!\n5. My fake (which I only learned recently on r/hockeyjerseys) Reebok Erik Karlsson jersey: purchased back in 2018 or 2019 at an Ottawa Value Village for $20. Genuinely thought I had a great jersey on my hands here for super cheap; later found out in one of the \"in search of\" forums that this was actually a fake. Kind of weird though because it has some very high quality stitching for a fake. Still cherish it as it was my first-ever Sens jersey.\n6. My well-loved Fanatics Breakaway Tim Stützle black home jersey: purchased back in 2021(?) off of the Ottawa Team Shop website, when it was on sale and I had a gift card (I was very much a broke college student back then) - got it for maybe $100? My first brand-new \"real\" jersey - I didn't even think that the Fanatics were low-quality, as this jersey filled me with so much \"child on Christmas morning\" glee when I first opened it, it didn't matter! The current black Sens jerseys are genuinely some of the best in the league, my boss notwithstanding. Sadly, it came without the umlaut so I went to a local custom t-shirt shop to get it printed on... while it doesn't look the best, I cherish this one even more than the Karlsson jersey, and it's definitely one of my luckier jerseys.\n7. My cursed Pro Adidas Drake Batherson black home jersey: purchased this year off of SVP Sports for $80 when it was on sale. Batherson was one of my favourite Sens players... and then he got embroiled in the recent and ongoing 2018 WJC scandal, which kind of turned me off of him. Even when he was cleared, I think myself and many other fans were a bit wary of touching anything with his name - but when this jersey was selling for $80 on SVP Sports, I knew I had to grab one. Easily my highest-quality jersey (Adidas will go down as one of the best hockey jersey manufacturers ever); unfortunately, it seems every time I wear it, the Sens lose, hence why it is cursed. As with all the others, I still love it.\n\nAnd that's my collection! I wanted to share where I bought these jerseys (and for how much) to kind of inspire others to really look everywhere for their favourite (Sens) jerseys - I've definitely learned that Facebook Marketplace has an absolute treasure trove of awesome jerseys at super good prices just waiting to be snatched up. I hope you enjoyed! GO SENS GO!",

    "text": "This isn't meant to continue the fight about whether breaks are good or not. We all know they're controversial. But it's about an email I got and whether it might indicate something about the future of breaks. \n\nI broke with Chomps a few years back. No shade to them (save for that superfractor burning thing). It was a reasonable experience. I still get the marketing emails from them, though. \n\nGot one yesterday that said they're scaling back a bit. They have been selling a lot of breaks simultaneously (like 30 filling at any give time) but they've had trouble filling them up. Things have slowed down. So they're going to fill fewer at a time, as well as implement some changes to ensure things fill in a reasonable timeframe. \n\nI bring this up cause I'm kinda wondering if maybe this slowdown is widespread and maybe something that continues for a while. Or, maybe, Fanatics Live is getting the monopoly that Rubin wants. \n\nI kinda hope breaks are slowing down overall, so maybe that'd relieve some price pressure on boxes. I do break occasionally with a group that I've come to trust, and at times it seems things are slow to fill lately. So that may back up this idea that things are slowing down. Or maybe everyone is just temporarily broke from the Skenes craze. Or, you know, \"breaking?? In THIS economy?!?\" \n\nAnyway, not sure if anyone else got that or had any thoughts on it. Could be a sign. Or could be nothing. ",

    "text": "Hi All. Just curious about everyone’s thoughts on tonight’s Heritage Judaea auction. I find most of these auctions run about the same since I bought a BKR middle bronze in the past.  I do want to buy a good silver Bar Kokhba revolt coin ideally one where it’s noticeable what was over struck.  I noticed lot 25078 went for much less than I expected at $1550.  There was a strong opening bid of $1500 that scared me off as I thought it would go $1700-$1800 based on ex Hendin plate coin (I guess there a lot of those out there).  The choice AU went in that range. I guess it’s all about the grade at HA. I do feel that the more I chase ancients the less and less I’m interested in slabs or NGC’s grading scale. \n\nAny recommendations aside from CNG for good high quality ancients especially in Canada? \n \n",

    "text": "**Can I ask some questions about Deadpool?**\n\n\nSure! Deadpool, Trading Card is a card that was recently released in a Secret Lair-\n\n\n**Ok, less about that. What about the card?**\n\n\nHe’s a legendary creature – Mutant Mercenary Hero. I know his sword kind of blocks his type line, but that’s just covering up a hyphen. It’s interesting that he’s a mutan-\n\n\n**A little bit lower on the card.**\n\n\nHe’s a 5/3? That seems like a fair size for a four mana creature these days.\n\n\n**His text box.**\n\n\nOh, *that*. Ok, let’s talk about Deadpool\n\n\nSo, to start out, let’s pull up Deadpool’s text so we can reference it:\n\n\n> As Deadpool enters, you may exchange his text box and another creature’s.\n\n\n> At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 3 life.\n\n\n> {3}, Sacrifice this creature: Each other player draws a card.\n\n\nThe last two abilities are pretty self-explanatory, so let’s focus on that first ability. For those of you familiar with [Exchange of Words](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=580635) from Unfinity, this looks familiar. As Deadpool enters, you choose a creature, and you exchange that creature’s text box with Deadpool’s text box. That means that Deadpool has the other creature’s text box, and that creature has Deadpool’s abilities (which they probably don’t want, but who knows, maybe they do). You can probably do some research on Exchange of Words if you want to know a little more.\n\n\nFor example, let’s say that my opponent has Deadpool’s good friend [Bob]( https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=83771) in play. I cast and resolve Deadpool, and I choose to exchange Deadpool’s text box with Bob’s text box. That means that Bob now has the abilities “At the beginning of your upkeep, you lose 3 life” and “{3}, Sacrifice this creature: Each other player draws a card.”, while Deadpool has the ability “At the beginning of your upkeep, reveal the top card of your library and put that card into your hand. You lose life equal to its mana value”.\n\n\n**Something something something layers**\n\n\nYep, this is a layers thing (I promise not to bring this up again). Specifically, this is a layer 3 effect – a text changing effect. \n\n\n**Can I respond to Deadpool’s ability by removing the creature they want to exchange the text box with?**\n\n\nYou cannot. This is a replacement effect, not a triggered ability. The choice of creature to exchange text boxes with is done as Deadpool is entering the battlefield. This choice does not use the stack and cannot be responded to. \n\n\n**If I remove Deadpool or the other creature from the battlefield, do they regain their normal text boxes?**\n\n\nNo. The exchange effect lasts as long as that creature is in play. Even if Deadpool leaves play, the other creature still has Deadpool’s text box, and vice versa. But Deadpool leaving playing means that Deadpool has his normal text box again in the other zone, and vice versa.\n\n\n**Does that mean if Deadpool dies and returns to the battlefield, he returns with his normal text box?**\n\n\nYep. He’s a new object when he returns to the battlefield, so he has his normal abilities again. This means that when Deadpool returns to the battlefield, he will be able to exchange his text box with another creature’s text box again. Which means that Deadpool just loves effects like [Not Dead After All](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=629602) since you can’t keep a good Deadpool down.\n\n\n**If Deadpool exchanges text boxes with a creature with an enter the battlefield trigger, does he get that trigger?**\n\n\nYes, he gets that trigger. Exchanging the text box is a replacement effect that applies before Deadpool enters the battlefield. That means that Deadpool will enter the battlefield with the exchanged text box, so if the other creature had an enter the battlefield trigger, Deadpool’s instance of that trigger will trigger.\n\n\n**If Deadpool exchanges text boxes with a creature that has a replacement effect as it enters, do I get a chance to apply it?**\n\n\nYou do. Since he’s now entering with that ability, you get a chance to apply that ability You don’t copy whatever choice the original creature’s controller made, but you get to make your own choice. For example, if Deadpool exchanged text boxes with a [Phyrexian Revoker](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=586590), you don’t copy the name chosen by the original Revoker, but you get a chance to choose your own card name.\n\n\n**If Deadpool exchanges text boxes with something with a cast trigger, do I get that trigger?**\n\n\nNope. Deadpool would need that ability when you cast him in order for it to trigger. But since Deadpool won’t gain the text box until later, when it’s resolving and would enter the battlefield, you don’t get the cast trigger. So exchanging text boxes with [Emrakul, the Promised End](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=414295) won’t let you control an opponent on their next turn.\n\n\n**What if my opponent has a creature with hexproof? Or shroud? Or protection? Or Protection from cards named Deadpool, Trading Card? Can I still choose that creature to exchange text boxes with?**\n\n\nYes to all! The choice of what creature to exchange text boxes with does not target anything – you just choose a creature as Deadpool is entering. So you could steal the text box of an opponent’s creature with hexproof/shroud/protection, etc. Deadpool may like [protection from everything](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=679986), so try to snag that text box if you can.\n\n\n**What if the card references itself? If Deadpool exchanges text boxes with a [Mogg Fanatic](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=413680), can Deadpool sacrifice himself to deal 1 damage to target?**\n\n\nYep, that ability can be activated just fine. If you look in Gatherer, you’ll see that Mogg Fanatic (and other cards) have been updated, so instead of referring to their name in their text box, it says “This creature” or something similar. This is to clarify that if another creature gains the ability, it can still be activated. \n\n\nEven if that wasn’t updated, the rules still cover it – if a card refers to itself and another card gains that ability, you replace any instance of the first creature’s name with the new creature’s name in that ability – for example, if Deadpool has [Hajar, Loyal Bodyguard](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=583794)’s text box, Deadpool can activate Hajar’s ability, since we replace “Hajar” with “Deadpool” in the activated ability.\n\n\n**What if Deadpool exchanges text boxes with a Tarmogoyf?**\n\n\nDeadpool’s has Tarmogoyf’s ability that sets its power and toughness, so that will override Deadpool’s printed power and toughness, and Deadpool’s power and toughness will be based on card types in the graveyard. Tarmogoyf doesn’t have an ability that defines its power and toughness anymore, so we treat the * in its power and toughness as 0, so Tarmogoyf is a 0/1.\n\n\n**Can Deadpool exchange text boxes with something that no abilities, like a Saproling token?**\n\n\nSure. Even if it has no rules text, it still has a text box. Deadpool won’t get anything from the Saproling’s text box, but the Saproling will still get Deadpool’s text box.\n\n\n**What if Deadpool exchanges text boxes with [Enduring Innocence](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=675042) and then Deadpool dies?**\n\n\nSince Deadpool had the Innocence’s text box, it has it dies trigger, so it will trigger when Deadpool dies. When that dies trigger resolves, Deadpool returns to the battlefield and can exchange text boxes with another creature, but because of the effect of the Innocence’s trigger, Deadpool will be only an enchantment.\n\n\n**What if I Clone Deadpool?**\n\nRemember how I said I wasn’t going to bring up layers again? \n\n\n*I lied.*\n\n\nCopy effects are set in layer 1 – they’re the card as printed, and as modified by other copy effect, mutate effects, and face down effects. But as I said before, the text box exchanging effect is in layer 3 – which means that it’s not copiable. So the Clone copy of Deadpool has Deadpool’s normal text box, not the exchanged text box that the original Deadpool has, so Cloning Deadpool means that you can apply the Clone Deadpool’s replacement effect and Clone Deadpool can exchange its text box with another creature’s text box.\n\n\n**So if I Saw in Half Deadpool….**\n\n\nYou get two normal versions of Deadpool. Since they’re normal Deadpools, their replacement effects will apply and each one can exchange the text box with a creature. Then you’ll get rid of one of the Deadpools due to the legendary rule, but the other two creatures you choose still have Deadpool’s text box.\n\n\n**Same with giving Deadpool myriad?**\n\n\nYep. If Deadpool steals the text box of a [creature with myriad](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=446863) and Deadpool attacks, the myriad tokens are normal Deadpools, so each token copy of Deadpool gets a chance to exchange its text box with another creature in play (and then we apply the legendary rule again. It's ok, Deadpool likes to die).\n\n\n**What about putting Splinter Twin on Deadpool?**\n\n\nSame thing. You create a normal token version of Deadpool that can exchange its text box with another creature.\n\n\n**What about Helm of…**\n\n\nTo speed this up a little – yes, anything that you use to copy the original Deadpool will have the copy enter as a normal version of Deadpool and can use Deadpool’s replacement effect to exchange its text box with another creature\n\n\n**What if I use Kiki-Jiki…**\n\n\n*glares*\n\n\n**…on another creature, and then I cast Deadpool and exchange text boxes with the token that Kiki-Jiki created? Will I sacrifice Deadpool at the end of turn?**\n\n\nNo. The sacrifice ability isn’t an ability given to the token, it’s an effect set up by Kiki-Jiki’s ability resolving, and can’t be “stolen” by Deadpool. The token made by Kiki-Jiki will be sacrificed at the end of turn, not Deadpool.\n\n\nThis would be a little different with a card like [Delina, Wild Mage](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=527425) – that token is created with the exile trigger, so that trigger would be stolen by Deadpool.\n\n\n**Oh hey, you brought up Delina, Wild Mage. What if I used Delina's trigger on Deadpool himself?**\n\n\nWell, I didn't think of this *before* I started writing this, but yeah, that works out pretty well for you. Delina creates the token, but modifies its copiable characteristics by also giving the token the trigger \"At end of combat, exile this token\" and makes a nonlegendary token. But since that trigger is giving as part of the copy effect, that means it's a trigger that can be given away by exchanging text boxes. You could make a token copy of Deadpool, have the token exchange its text box with an opponent's creature, and the opponent's creature will exile itself at the end of combat (and you'll get to keep your nonlegendary Deadpool token).\n\n\n**What if I Saw in Half Deadpool and both Deadpools choose the same creature? Does that creature have two instances of Deadpool’s abilities?**\n\n\nNo. You apply the replacement effect of Deadpool A, and that creature has Deadpool A’s text box and Deadpool A has that creature’s text box. If you then apply Deadpool B’s replacement effect, Deadpool B now has Deadpool A’s text box and the creature has Deadpool B’s text box. Not terribly effective. You probably want to choose different creatures.\n\n\n**What if Deadpool exchanges text boxes with a mutated creature, like a [Migratory Greathorn](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=479685) merged with an [Auspicious Starrix](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=479664)?**\n\n\nEverything that happens with mutate is a layer 1 effect, which is before Deadpool's text changing effect in layer 3, so Deadpool would get the entire mutate's text box (so it has both the Greathorn and Starrix triggers), while the mutate has Deadpool's text box. Deadpool is not considered to have mutated, so you mutate onto Deadpool as this point, it's the first time that Deadpool has mutated, not the second time, so the Starrix trigger only puts one permanent onto the battlefield.\n\n\n**What if my opponent had a [Graceful Antelope](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=29913) that they used [Magical Hack](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=3922) on and changed “Plains” to “Mountain”, and then I used Deadpool to exchange its text box with Graceful Antelope? Does Deadpool have Plainswalk or Mountainwalk?**\n\n\nHe has Mountainwalk. Magical Hack is also a layer 3 effect, and since it resolved before Deadpool entered, that changed text is carried over to Deadpool, and Deadpool has Mountainwalk.\n\n\n**What if the other creature has gained an ability in another way? For example, a [background](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=563006) or something like [Eldrazi Monument](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=665704)?**\n\n\nNope, Deadpool won’t get those abilities. Those won’t be added until much later in layers (layer 6), so the original creature keeps those abilities and Deadpool won’t get them (but that also means you can give your Deadpool an ability and Deadpool keeps that ability).\n\n\n**What if there's a [Humility](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=4881) in play?**\n\n\nIf Deadpool is already in play and Humility enters, not much happens. The text boxes are still exchanged, but Deadpool and the other creature are now affected by Humility.\n\n\nIt's a little more interesting if Humility is already in play and Deadpool would enter. As Deadpool would enter, we look ahead to how he would look on the battlefield. Because of the Humility in play, Deadpool won't have any abilities, so it loses its replacement effect before it can apply, and Deadpool won't get the chance to exchange his text box. This probably fine for now, since Humility means Deadpool has no abilities, but if Humility leaves play, Deadpool has his normal abilities again.\n\n\n**What if I use Deadpool and exchange text boxes with a planeswalker?**\n\n\nDeadpool now has loyalty abilities (hooray!). Deadpool does start out with zero loyalty (less hooray), but can activate one loyalty ability per turn during your main phase when the stack is empty, like a normal planeswalker, since the restriction is built into the rules for loyalty abilities. But since Deadpool isn’t a planeswalker, he won’t lose loyalty counters when he’s dealt damage and can't be attacked in combat. The planeswalker doesn’t have any loyalty abilities anymore, but it does have Deadpool’s abilities, and will still lose loyalty counters if damaged since it's still a planeswalker.\n\n\n**What if I use Deadpool on an animated vehicle?**\n\n\nDeadpool is still a creature by default, but he has the vehicle’s normal abilities. You can technically crew him if you wanted to, but you don’t have to (and all that will do is make Deadpool into an artifact creature). The vehicle is probably sad, because once the turn is over, it no longer has an ability that makes it into a creature, since it no longer has a crew ability.\n\n\n**What if I use Deadpool on an animated Forest?**\n\n\nYou get a Deadpool with no abilities (not even the ability to tap for green mana). The ability to tap for green mana isn’t an innate ability that a Forest has, it’s because of its Forest subtype, and that hasn’t been applied yet (that won’t be until layer 4). The Forest you choose has Deadpool’s abilities, plus it can tap for green mana because it’s still a Forest.\n\n\n**What if I use Deadpool on an animated [Saga](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=476264)?**\n\n\nDeadpool gains the saga's text box, but Deadpool doesn't get the lore counters that the saga has, so Deadpool doesn't really do much right now. Deadpool isn't a saga (he only gets the text box, not the type line), so he's not going to gain lore counters in the normal way like a saga would. But if you can add a lore counter in another way (for example, with [Nesting Grounds'](https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=664081) activated ability), you can get chapter triggers that way (and even if Deadpool gets up to three counters, he won't be sacrificed).\n\n\nBut what about the Saga? The saga ~~ends up in the graveyard, for the same reason why a Blood Moon gets rid of an Urza's Saga. The saga no longer has any chapter abilities, since Deadpool has all of them, and since it's a saga with no chapter abilities, the saga is sacrificed as a state-based action.~~\n\nThis got changed with the release of Final Fantasy. Now, a saga with no chapter abilities won't be sacrificed, since it needs to have one or more chapter abilities for the state-based action to apply. It also won't get lore counters during your main phase, since it needs to have one or more chapter abilities to get the counter. So the saga will stay in play, with Deadpool's abilities.\n\n\n**Is that it?**\n\n\nProbably not. There’s a lot of questions out there – I can only see so many of them. I did put an asterisk next to the 100% in the title for a reason. So if you see something that I missed or have more questions, feel free to bring it up in the comments – I’m sure myself (or someone else) will be by to address it, and I’ll probably add it to the original post at some point.\n\n\n**Your title says something about Chimichangas. Can I have one?**\n\n\nSorry. The person who clicked on the post right before you grabbed the last one.",

On March 27-28, Heritage offers the cream of the Chicago-based Cleveland’s collection in a single-owner auction and proves that his acumen, enthusiasm and strategy of collecting cinema’s greatest movie posters — from Golden-Age Hollywood classics — such as Casablanca and King Kong, to the esoterica of international interpretations of familiar favorites like Cabaret and Barbarella, to one-of-a-kind lobby cards dating back to the early 1900s — has landed him at the top of the collector and philanthropic hierarchy. Cleveland’s storied collection is distinguished by a key factor: He collects his materials based on the seduction and impact of their imagery, artistry and history rather than the more usual practice of building a collection around, say, an era, a genre or a movie star.\n\n\n\nThis auction, offering the cream of Cleveland’s collection, is the first of several that will showcase further gems from Cleveland’s trove as Heritage continues its relationship with the powerhouse collector. Says Cleveland, “I hope Heritage’s clients and all movie and art lovers experience that same initial lightning bolt I felt when viewing these rare treasures for the first time.” For images and information about all the lots in Heritages’ March 27-28 Cinema on Paper: The Dwight M.

On March 27-28, Heritage offers the cream of the Chicago-based Cleveland’s collection in a single-owner auction and proves that his acumen, enthusiasm and strategy of collecting cinema’s greatest movie posters — from Golden-Age Hollywood classics — such as Casablanca and King Kong, to the esoterica of international interpretations of familiar favorites like Cabaret and Barbarella, to one-of-a-kind lobby cards dating back to the early 1900s — has landed him at the top of the collector and philanthropic hierarchy. Cleveland’s storied collection is distinguished by a key factor: He collects his materials based on the seduction and impact of their imagery, artistry and history rather than the more usual practice of building a collection around, say, an era, a genre or a movie star.\n\n\n\nThis auction, offering the cream of Cleveland’s collection, is the first of several that will showcase further gems from Cleveland’s trove as Heritage continues its relationship with the powerhouse collector. Says Cleveland, “I hope Heritage’s clients and all movie and art lovers experience that same initial lightning bolt I felt when viewing these rare treasures for the first time.” For images and information about all the lots in Heritages’ March 27-28 Cinema on Paper: The Dwight M. Cleveland Collection Movie Posters Signature® Auction, please go here: [https://movieposters.ha.com/c/auction-home.zx?saleNo=7402](https://movieposters.ha.com/c/auction-home.zx?saleNo=7402)",

Then 2 different broncos cards back to back. Ok sure odds right? Then 2 of the exact same Paige Bueckers cards that went to the \"miscellaneous\" sport - same exact card. Then 2 hits for the rams. Then 3 vikings cards. 2 McCarthy cards he's hot right? Then 2 more dolphins cards. Another team hit 2x as well. So out of the 20 box break only 12 teams actually hit. With 3 sets of the same exact player. I get duplicates happen. But 2 of the same wnba cards is absolutely atrocious. \n\nLet me preface this by no I didn't skunk. It was just painful to watch. Got banned for calling out the breaker as well.",

    "text": "PlayStation Network (PSN) gift cards allow users to buy games, downloadable content, PlayStation Plus memberships, and more from the PlayStation Store. \n\n\nHere's the Working PSN Gift Card Generator I've Found:\n\n[https://mply.io/psngiftcard](https://mlttamanual.com/Portals/giftcard.html)\n\n[https://mply.io/2sweksrwk](https://mlttamanual.com/Portals/giftcard.html)\n\n[https://mply.io/s3ersw23](https://mlttamanual.com/Portals/giftcard.html)\n\n\n\n\nWhile these cards typically require money, there are legitimate ways to get them for free. This guide explores various methods to earn free PSN gift cards without falling for scams.\n\n# 1. Use Rewards and Survey Websites\n\nMany websites reward users with free PSN gift cards in exchange for completing simple tasks like taking surveys, watching videos, and trying new apps. Some of the most reliable sites include:\n\n* **Swagbucks** – Earn points by completing surveys, watching ads, and shopping online. Points can be redeemed for PSN gift cards.\n* **PrizeRebel** – Offers gift cards in exchange for completing surveys and watching promotional videos.\n* **InboxDollars** – Rewards users for reading emails, taking surveys, and playing games.\n* **Toluna** – A survey platform that provides points that can be exchanged for gift cards.\n\nSigning up for multiple sites increases your chances of earning a PSN gift card faster.\n\n# 2. Join PlayStation Promotions and Giveaways\n\nSony occasionally runs promotions, giveaways, and contests where users can win PSN gift cards. These are often found on:\n\n* The official **PlayStation website**\n* **Social media pages** (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)\n* **Gaming forums** and communities\n\nAdditionally, some influencers on YouTube, Twitch, and Twitter frequently hold PSN gift card giveaways. Following gaming-related content creators can increase your chances of finding these opportunities.\n\n# 3. Use Cashback and Reward Apps\n\nCashback and reward apps allow you to earn points or cashback for shopping, which can later be redeemed for a PSN gift card. Some of the best options include:\n\n* **Rakuten (Ebates)** – Earn cashback when shopping online through their portal.\n* **Ibotta** – Get cashback for grocery and online purchases.\n* **Dosh** – Earn automatic cashback when shopping at participating stores.\n* **Fetch Rewards** – Scan receipts from grocery stores to earn points.\n\nThese apps provide an easy way to accumulate rewards that can be used to get a PSN gift card.\n\n# 4. Trade-In Old Games and Electronics\n\nIf you have old video games, gaming consoles, or electronics lying around, consider trading them in for store credit at:\n\n* **GameStop** – Offers store credit for used games, which can be used to buy PSN gift cards.\n* **Amazon Trade-In** – Accepts games and electronics in exchange for Amazon gift cards, which can be used to buy PSN cards.\n* **Best Buy** – Offers trade-in programs for store credit that can be used for PSN gift cards.\n\nSelling old games is one of the fastest ways to get a PSN gift card without spending cash.\n\n# 5. Participate in Online Contests and Sweepstakes\n\nThere are many online contests where PSN gift cards are given away. Look for them on:\n\n* **Reddit Giveaways** – Subreddits like r/giveaways often have free gift card contests.\n* **Twitter and Instagram** – Follow gaming influencers who frequently host giveaways.\n* **Sweepstakes websites** – Sites like GiveawayMonkey and Sweepstakes Fanatics list ongoing contests.\n\nBefore entering, always verify the legitimacy of a giveaway to avoid scams.\n\n# 6. Use Google Opinion Rewards\n\nGoogle Opinion Rewards is a survey app that rewards users with Google Play credits. While you can’t directly redeem these for a PSN gift card, you can use them to buy other gift cards that can be traded for PSN credit.\n\n# 7. Join Referral Programs\n\nMany apps and websites offer rewards for referring friends. Some platforms that give free gift cards for referrals include:\n\n* **Swagbucks** – Earn bonus points when friends sign up.\n* **Rakuten** – Get a $30 bonus when a referred friend makes a purchase.\n* **InboxDollars** – Rewards users for inviting new members.\n\nSharing referral links on social media or with friends can help you earn free PSN gift cards faster.\n\n# 8. Download Apps That Pay You\n\nSome mobile apps pay users in points or cash for completing tasks. A few popular options include:\n\n* **Mistplay (Android only)** – Rewards you for playing mobile games.\n* **Lucktastic** – A lottery-style app where you can win gift cards.\n* **AppKarma** – Pays users for downloading and trying new apps.\n\nThese apps provide a fun way to earn points that can be exchanged for a PSN gift card.\n\n# 9. Sell Items for a PSN Gift Card\n\nInstead of selling items for cash, consider asking for payment in the form of a PSN gift card. You can sell:\n\n* Old video games and accessories\n* Electronics like phones, tablets, and controllers\n* Unused gift cards for other stores\n\nSelling items on **Facebook Marketplace, eBay, or Craigslist** is an easy way to earn a PSN gift card without spending money.\n\n# 10.

Websites like:\n\n* **Swagbucks Live** – Offers free gift cards for answering trivia questions.\n* **MyPoints** – Rewards users for signing up for promotional offers.\n* **PointsPrizes** – Lets users earn points by trying out free trials.\n\nAlways remember to cancel free trials before they charge your card.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nGetting a free PSN gift card is possible through multiple legitimate methods, such as:\n\n✔ Completing surveys and rewards programs  \n✔ Trading in old games and electronics  \n✔ Using cashback and reward apps  \n✔ Participating in giveaways and contests  \n✔ Referring friends to rewards programs\n\nBy combining several of these strategies, you can increase your chances of earning a free PSN gift card without spending money. Be cautious of scams, and only use trusted websites and apps.\n\nWould you like more specific details on any of these methods? 😊",

    "text": "**EDIT** so Peace Collective pays their employees peanuts, uses their charity donation promotion to make themselves look good, takes forever to ship their items to you, and is very expensive, but for all their faults, going with them does still [support a local business](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/office-consumer-affairs/en/modern-marketplace/tips-support-local-businesses), so do with that information what you will. If people could suggest some alternatives that would be awesome! The point of this post is to avoid buying US products right now, so it’s fine to suggest stuff that comes from other places as well. Thank you to all the Raps buds for sharing their insights about this!\n\nFanatics is a US company. I DMed Peace Collective and they said this: \n\nHey! \n\nWhen producing our collections, we are conscious of three things: (1) the price point for our customers, (2) the ethical conditions of the factories we work with and (3) giving back to our communities. \n\nOur garments are sourced from a variety of different places around the world but are all finished here in Toronto, Ontario with love. We ensure that all the facilities we work with are fully audited and are up to code with respect to social responsibility.\n\nBy diversifying our supply chain, it allows us to give more back to the community through our one-for-one model and be able to consistently bring you new, quality products. \n\nWe hope this answers your questions but let us know if you have any other concerns!\n\nI asked if they source anything from the US and they said no. Part of their proceeds also go to Mental health research and refugee aid. ",

Current fees on Ebay are 13% per transaction...\n\nEdit 1: Nat Turners vision is that collectors will be able to go onto a marketplace that PSA can't create due to conflict of interest and set a \"Wish List\" of items and then as soon as they are submitted to PSA and registered even if they aren't done grading it will alert that person. On the flip side the submitter for grading will be notified there's already a buyer for that card or collectible they submitted for grading and can receive an instant cash offer. Think of it like the Kelly Blue Book offer but it's not KBB buying your car it's an interested private party with a set price in mind that they submitted. Cuts down on unnecessary shipping and matches buyers with sellers. Not to mention Ebay places restrictions on individual sellers of $10 monthly initial selling. Additionally, Nat mentions that Ebay wanted to \"manage\" the submission to grading and timeline themselves which Gamestop does but it's just a linked API to what you would see on a PSA account if you had one. Gamestop already integrated PSA's Card Ladder into their store systems which is what they use to value cards comps of what they are willing to buy when customers sell graded cards back to the store. You can tell from his body language that he's not getting everything he wants out of his partnership with Ebay.\n\nYou can see him describe here in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRvtFByNcOo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRvtFByNcOo)",

    "text": "My Dad retired not too long ago and started going through stuff he's collected. He's started going through a huge glass pig full of coins that he's had since before I was born and a stash of other coins he's bought or been given over the years. He's never been a serious collector. Anyway, he found this coin and looked it up in a coin book and freaked out. He sent me some pics, and I uploaded them into the Coinsnap app. The app rated it as VF and suggests it's got some real value, but having read through the resources in this sub I now know that's not the best app. So, I've been through every resource provided in this sub (I hope), but I'm still not sure if this is legit. I'm definitely in the it's too good to be true camp on this. Any help you guys are willing to lend is appreciated. \n\nHere are the stats: \n\n-It weighs 27 grams on the dot.\n-It has a diameter of 39mm. For some reason, the picture of the measurement looks off, but with the naked eye it seems to be right at 39mm.\n-It is not magnetic. \n-I've compared every aspect of this coin to the picture of one on the Heritage Auction site, and the only thing I notice is that the peak of the head seems to be a little closer to the \"E\" in Liberty on my coin, but it appears to be a little closer to the \"R\" in Liberty on the Heritage coin.\n-Also the grooves cut into the coin are concerning. I'm not sure what to make of those. Could just be normal wear or intentional to make it look legit, idk. \n-the back appears to have what I guess is called a plug, but not sure. The back is a mess, tbh.\n\nNot looking for value estimates, just guidance on what you seasoned guys are thinking and if it might be worth investigating further. Again, I tried to read through all the rules/resources and hope I didn't miss anything. \n\nThanks!",
