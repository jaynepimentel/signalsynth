    "text": "Not sure if I can send this complaint to Riot/Riftbound team directly but collecting cards in general is incredibly frustrating lately. Scalpers are the main issues but the secondary issue is when LGS BECOME the scalpers. There is no reason every single one of my 8 LGS in the area should be marked up to TCGPlayer prices.\n\nI have been collecting since 1996, Magic, Pokemon, Yugioh, Dragon Ball, Digimon the works. This day and age, collecting is looked at as a side hustle for a lot of people but LGS/LCS were always the last bastion of normalcy. Gonna throw a \"BACK IN MY DAY\" here, stores we disincentivized if they were caught marking up product past a certain point. Riftbound boxes being around $150/$170ish would be around that markup area. Neopets and WOTC used to straight ban stores from getting products, and still do to this day (Neopets) if distribution guidelines are not followed. I really suggest Riot take this route so Riftbound can be fun and affordable to enter more players hands at a local level.\n\nWell what about the scalpers you say? They will just buy out the LGS and relist on TCGPlayer. Do what Japan does.\n\n\n- Box limits per WEEK\n- Plastic cut on Booster Boxes\n- Some even go as far as cutting the top of packs on sale so they are no longer  sealed.\n\nScalpers hate all of this. What are you gonna do, list 36 picks whose seals are all broken? This game is awesome, I want it to thrive. I don't want it to become the frustrating circlejerk sphere that is Pokemon currently. If people cannot buy product affordably, they will leave.",

    "text": "The most famous Pokémon card in the world has a new owner. Earlier today, February 16, 2026, Logan Paul’s **PSA 10 Pikachu Illustrator** was sold at **Goldin Auctions** for a staggering **$16,492,000**.\n\nThe winning bid was placed by venture capitalist **A.J. Scaramucci** (son of Anthony Scaramucci). The sale, which included the famous $80,000 diamond-encrusted pendant Paul wore at WrestleMania, officially shatters the world record for the most expensive trading card ever sold at auction.\n\nWhile the headline focuses on the record-breaking price, the sale has reignited a massive controversy regarding Paul’s fractionalization platform, **Liquid Marketplace**.\n\nAccording to reports and user allegations emerging in early 2026:\n\n* **The Fractionalization:** Paul originally sold **51%** of the card’s ownership to the public through Liquid Marketplace for approximately **$2.55 million**.\n* **The \"Buyback\":** Critics and investors allege that Paul later \"bought back\" this 51% majority stake for just **$250,000**—roughly 10% of what investors paid—reportedly without the consent of the fractional owners.\n* **The Profit:** By \"cleaning\" the ownership title through this controversial buyback, Paul was able to keep the entirety of the **$16.5 million** sale price, effectively \"double-dipping\" and leaving the original investors with massive losses or worthless tokens.\n\n**Legal Status:**\n\nThe **Ontario Securities Commission (OSC)** has reportedly intensified its investigation into Liquid Marketplace. The probe is focused on whether the platform misappropriated approximately **$3 million** of investor funds and whether the fractional tokens were being operated as illegal, unregistered securities.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this the greatest flip in history, or a textbook example of a \"rug pull\" disguised as a collectible investment?",

    "text": "Just wanted to share my journey on investing in number plates. back in 2021 I started buying heritage number plates as an investment. \n\nSharing the breakdown below of how it went:\n\nBatch 1 - bought 9 VIC plates directly from Vicroads for 12k each for $108k total. Sold all 9 for a total $304k. $196k profit, roughly 195% average return across the batch. Best one was 142.000 which returned 318%. There were some major catalysts, like Vicroads closing down their hertiage plate sales which meant the only source was the secondary market\n\n234.345 - bought for $30k, sold for $43k. Flipped in less than a month, 43% return. I bought this off the secondary market when vicroads plate sales were closed.\n\nNSW 3425 - bought for $149k, sold for $152k. Only made $3k on this one. Lesson learned about the NSW market being less liquid than VIC.\n\nBatch 2 - I'm currently holding 10 VIC plates bought for a total $198k. Estimating that ill be able to sell each plate for about 30k. i was able to buy these for 18k each just before Vicroads completely stopped selling hertiage number plates last year.\n\nTotal deployed: $507k \n\nRealised profit: $224k+ \n\nUnrealised upside: $131k\n\nI know people in the market who've done much higher returns trading lower 3/4/5 digit victorian heritage plates. My edge was i was early started this back in 2021 and i also built a script to scan through the available combinations on [vplates.com.au](http://vplates.com.au) and identify which plates were available. Only other way to do this was manually and VicRoads had over 285,000 heritage plates available for sale so there was a lot of data to work through.\n\nThe market is surprisingly liquid for the right combos and you can find a lot of past history through auction websites. it was a fun addition to my portfolio\n\nIs anyone else in here investing in number plates or other collectibles?",

    "text": "Hi everyone \n\nI’ve been collecting (and occasionally selling) signed caps and sports memorabilia for a while now, and I wanted to compare notes with the community.\n\nHere are the main channels I know and use to buy and sell autographed hats, jerseys, cards, and memorabilia — curious to hear which ones you trust most and why.\n\nBuy & Sell type\n\neBay\nStill the biggest marketplace by far. Huge audience, auctions or Buy It Now. Great for liquidity, but you really need to know what you’re doing with authentication.\n\nGoldin\nMore high-end, auction-focused. Best for rare or valuable signed pieces. Not ideal for low-value items, but strong buyer confidence.\n\nFanatics Collect\nGrowing fast. Focused on authenticated items with auctions and vaulting. Feels more “modern” and collector-oriented.\n\nPristine Marketplace / Pristine Auctions\nVery popular for signed memorabilia. Lots of daily auctions, especially for hats, jerseys, and photos.\n\nBeckett Marketplace\nGood if you’re already dealing with graded cards or Beckett-authenticated items.\n\nI know these Specialty Memorabilia Shops (Mostly Buying, Sometimes Consignment)\n\nSportsMemorabilia.com\n\nPro Am Sports (Canada)\n\nFrameworth (Canada)\n\nImperial Sports (Canada)\n\nMintink (cards & autos)\n\nEast Coast Sports Collectibles\n\nThese are great for buying with confidence, though prices can be higher than peer-to-peer marketplaces.\n\nWhich platforms do YOU trust the most for signed caps or memorabilia? Where have you gotten your best deals? Any platforms you avoid — and why?\n\nAre there any underrated sites or communities I’m missing?\nAlways good to learn from other collectors.",

It took 4 days to get down to the last few teams. They had to serial one due to the price then it was down to just the Nationals. \n\nThe Nats were discounted several times over 6 hours and no bites. I offered 50 dollars for the laughs but they took it. 😂 The chat thanked me for “taking one for the team.” The break finally begins.\n\nThe first box he pulls a Randy Johnson First Inscriptions card and the chat is excited and the host seems to be mildly amused and moves on to box 2. The third card he pulls causes his face to look like he’s going to puke. Here’s the pulls from the 20 cards total 😆.\n\nWhich leads me to the question…..there’s not a ton of data that I can find. Should get the auto certified, get them graded, or go with raw? ",

I have also included a wishlist for trades.\n\n.\n\nI have a loooottt to go through today. I believe anything over $100 is priced accordingly in the image descriptions, except for the PC album which is just trades. I would like to help people out with finishing up any master sets they need, and have organized my childhood collection by sets for easy viewing. The main set albums will only contain non holos. The holos are separated out in other albums titled \"PC, Creased, Scratched, Holos undamaged\".\n\n.\n\n**Disclaimers:** Almost all cards prior to Expedition and Skyridge will be MP or less. There may be some LP or NM sprinkled in. Post E series, most will be LP-NM. There are also some random foreign language cards sprinkled out prior to the E series sets. No idea why lol.\n\n.\n\n**Ignore the stickers on the pages. They are irrelevant and outdated. Also, I will not message you, if we agree I will need you to message me when ready, and let me know which cards it is you are buying as a confirmation (to streamline the process).**\n\n**.**\n\nI haven't checked, but assume nothing will 10 in the binder pages. It'll save us time.\n\n.\n\nProbably obvious, but just in case, when looking at the binder pages, the left and right columns switch places when looking at the back of the cards.\n\n.\n\nSome of the binder pages are old... if it looks like there are scratches or gunk, it may just be on the page itself, otherwise they will be taken into consideration when valuing the cards if I can't get it cleaned off.\n\nI won't be doing closeups of cards less than $4 in value. I believe I am versed enough now to be able to tell you the condition, and if I am not sure I will send closeups gladly.\n\nI am not in a rush to sell anything, so I will not be doing bulk selling. **Pricing will be 90%** of tcgplayer market pricing for nearly everything. Some ebay recently sold will be taken into account for low pop sales.\n\n.\n\n**Shipping: $1 PWE, $5 BMWT. Sealed pricing includes shipping. Items will be shipped out by Tuesday the 10th.**\n\n**.**\n\n**----SORTED COMMONS, UNCOMMONS, AND RARES-----**\n\n**Base set:**

I mainly sell/consign via Heritage HK / SBP HK.\n\nI’m debating whether it’s worth doing a PCGS crossover vs keeping it in NGC. Ideally I’d only want to cross if it can stay AU55, but I’m also considering whether an AU53 outcome could still make sense.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* For Chinese silver (late Qing / provincial), how often do you see NGC AU55 cross to PCGS AU55?\n* Is crossover generally more conservative than cracking and submitting raw?\n* Any advice on minimum grade setting (AU55 vs AU53 vs ANY)?\n* If the coin can only cross at PCGS AU53, is that still a reasonable move in terms of market acceptance/value?\n* Does pedigree/provenance help at all with PCGS decisions, or is it purely surface/grade?\n\nThanks!",

    "text": "Apologies in advance for the long post, but looking for any help or guidance here.\n\nI bought into a Chrome Update break on Fanatics Live on December 14th. One of the cards I hit was a Marcelo Mayer Radiating Rookies Superfractor Auto redemption card. As a lifelong Red Sox, obviously I was floored. Fast-forward to a week later, it never arrives. USPS tracking showed that it was \"pending delivery.\" I inquired at the post office, they weren't able to find it, so it's lost. I reached out to Fanatics Support via phone, was told that I'd have to reach out to Fanatics LIVE support, of which there is no phone or chat support, only email. I got a response back (spoiler alert, the ONLY response I've received throughout this issue) that I'd need to file a claim with USPS and then they'd be able to resolve pending the claim outcome. I did as instructed, USPS deemed it lost and unretrievable, and I forwarded as much to Fanatics Live. Complete radio silence onward. Not even a \"we're looking into this\" type message, just nothing, despite 3-4 separate tickets on the issue.\n\nMy thought is that since Fanatics is the manufacturer and distributor here, they should be able to verify that I'm entitled to the card, that the shipment is lost, that it hasn't been redeemed by me, and that they should be able to provide some alternative method of redemption, but this seems too tall a task. Fanatics boasts their \"Fanatics ONE\" account experience of a unified account across all their platforms, but their customer service couldn't be more disparate. I called into Fanatics (not Live) support this morning to see if they could maybe get in touch with Live to escalate or something and was told they have no connection whatsoever with Fanatics Live and wouldn't be able to help and was advised to just spam the email or complain on social media. Unbelievable that this is their recommendation. By nothing they are ensuring only two possible outcomes:\n\n1. A superfractor rookie autograph card never see the light of day\n2. The card is somehow redeemed by someone who has no right to it.\n\nAnyway, I guess the learning experience here is either don't break with Fanatics Live or be sure to insure big hits or get overnight shipping. I hadn't had any issue with fulfillment prior to this so it didn't occur to me at the time. \n\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "So apparently the new Topps Sapphire Basketball released Jan 22nd with a limited quantity of 500 cases x 10 boxes for a grand total of 5000 boxes. Now that's a pretty limited run these days. Well surfing the net and watching some YouTube vids has shown me that Backyard Breaks had 50 cases, or 10% of the entire print run. Filthbomb was given a similar allocation, so now we are at about 20% of the print run without factoring in a single other breaker that gets allocation from Fanatics. \n\nSingle boxes are so limited on the secondary market that they are going for 5x. There are a grand total of 23 available to purchase on eBay at the time I'm writing this. Call me a doomer - I don't really give a shit - but this is why you couldn't get Black & White or Bob Ross. And when you cant get those, and you don't want to pay 5x guess where you're gonna go - to the breakers. EQL or not, this is why these products are sold out in less than 5 minutes. Get used to only buying low end products or be a part of the problem and feed the breakers. When I can't get my hands on a case of Platinum Chrome Anniversary Fanatics I will officially be 100% vintage. Good luck everybody.",

    "text": "what are the opinions on whatnot sellers? I ask for 2 reasons: the first being I had a guy come up to my table at my last show and wanted a pretty sizeable stack of cards. The overall total of the stack was $2,300, and I told him I'd do $2100 for a bulk deal. He grimaced and told me we were so close, and then asked if I could do $1500. \"That's my absolute best, I'm low key taking some stuff off your hands and I gotta carry em rest of the show, catalog and get new top loaders so I'm factoring labor into this.\" I wasn't overly offended, but I told him $2000 was the lowest. He got so mad and basically stormed off and the vendor behind me told that wasn't unusual for that guy and that he's got a name in our community for being a really opportunistic and derogatory whatnot streamer. is whatnot like that all the time? I've never really been on and never spent money on it, but have had a few people tell me \"oh yeah I'm a whatnot streamer, you might've heard of the stream.\" second reason is: is selling on whatnot worth it? I can't imagine it is if your asking for that kinda discount....? ",

    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’m putting up for sale my Tommy Hilfiger Nintendo Game Boy Color tabletop kiosk from 1999, complete with its original box. This is the silver Hilfiger‑branded display with the yellow GBC mounted in the center, originally used in Tommy Hilfiger stores as a promo piece rather than sold to the public.\n\nPhotos: https://imgur.com/a/5JHRFZm\n\nConsoleVariations documents this exact kiosk and estimates only about 100–500 units were ever produced, giving it a very high rarity score as an official limited release.\n\nTo give a sense of value: Heritage Auctions sold a brand‑new, boxed example of this same kiosk for 5,760 USD in 2022, which you can verify in their archived lot description (links posted below). A more recent private purchase documented in an unboxing video shows a mint boxed kiosk changing hands for around 1,500 USD shipped.\n\nMy unit is in good vintage condition overall. The kiosk shows light scuffs and typical wear from age and handling, but the colors and logos still present really well on display. There are no cracks or structural damage. The original box has edge and corner wear, yet it’s intact and still does its job protecting the kiosk. I’m happy to send detailed close‑ups of any area and a video walk‑around so you can judge the condition yourself.\n\nBecause of the documented rarity and the sales mentioned above, I’m asking \\*\\*$4,500 OBO\\*\\*. I’m open to reasonable, well‑explained offers (especially from serious collectors who’ve been hunting this piece and understand how seldom a boxed example appears).\n\nI’m located in Pensacola, Florida (Panhandle). Local pickup is strongly preferred due to size and value, but I can ship within the \\*\\*US ONLY.\\*\\* If shipped, it will be professionally packed, fully insured for the agreed price, and sent with signature confirmation.\n\nFor payment, I’ll take cash in person for local pickup, or PayPal Goods & Services for shipped deals so both sides have protection. I’ll provide packing photos, tracking, and any documentation you’d like from the references mentioned above.\n\nIf you’re interested, send me a DM and I’ll share a full photo set and videos.\n\nHere are the key references and sources that back up the rarity, past sales and background of this kiosk:\n\n• Heritage sale: https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/other/game-boy-color-tabletop-kiosk-brand-new-tommy-hilfiger-edition-gbc-nintendo-1999-usa\n\n• Rarity info: https://consolevariations.com/collectibles/nintendo-game-boy-color-tommy-hilfiger-kiosk\n\n• Nintendo Gameboy Color Tommy Hilfiger Kiosk - YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCx7KQNQ7WU\n\n• Rare Tommy Hilfiger Game Boy Color tabletop kiosk-  https://www.cllct.com/sports-collectibles/auctions/rare-game-boy-color-tommy-hilfiger-tabletop-kiosk-headed-to-auction",

I've literally just been banned from a streamer (RosiesPokemon) who's quite big in the UK, for calling out that the cards he pushing to go higher were literally 5-10 quid cards. These were Chinese 151 ultra rares of Charizard, Blastoise, venasaur and mew. Mew went for over 50 alone raw and he was telling people to up the bids even more. He normally gets a few 100 views per stream and as soon as I asked a out the true value of them cards he basically just berated me and banned me from this stream. I get someone massively over paying is their own fault for doing no research on the cards but there's a high chance this could just be kids he's scamming, does this bother other people or do you see it as a buyers beware lesson?",

Well the breaker said they were out of top loaders that fit the thick RPAs?  To make matters worse, they also didn't have the right penny sleeves and looked like they were trying to force it into the regular ones.  I made it clear that I wanted it sleeved and was going to grade it - they assured me that someone would put in top loader later before shipping.  Well it came in the mail sandwiched between two top loaders (not inside either) with tape holding them together.  One corner was visibly damaged.\n\nI reached out to them and to their credit they asked how they could make it right - which is where my dilemma is.  I've been chasing this card so not a fan of sending it back for refund but I also am not happy at its condition now.  Appreciate any ideas on suggestions on how they could \"make things right\".",

    "text": "I used to collect as a kid but as of last week I’m back in the hobby. Unfortunately, my reintroduction was through breakers on fanatics as I was unaware of how problematic breaking was (please don’t yell at me! I am now aware of how bad breaking is for the hobby and will not be breaking with card breakers going forward). Anyway, I got a decent hit off a case break. I got the card yesterday and it has damaged in the corner. I didn’t notice any damage on the live stream, nor did the streamer indicate that the cards in the case were damaged in any way. There was no damage to the shipping from what I could tell. The damage is to one corner of the card, and my guess would be that it was damaged while the breaker was loading the card based on how the corner looks.\n\nAnyway I messaged the shop that I purchased the spot in the case break through about the damage. They asked what they could do to make this right and I said send a comp card or refund my purchase entirely. They instead replied by saying they can send me an empty card package for the particular case and I can send it back to Topps. They said that they receive cards that are already dinged up, which I can understand. However, I don’t want to risk submitting a claim with topps for a damaged card because if they deny my claim I will be screwed, especially because I have 30 days from date of purchase to raise any issues with an order on fanatics live.\n\nAnyway, just looking for some advice from those that have dealt with receiving damaged cards from a break on fanatics live",

    "text": "So, before I start on this, I want to say ive been watching this guy for maybe 8 months now and I really am proud of how far he has come and what he is doing now. At first, I didnt know what to make of all the drama, the trolls, the lore.. I now am a loyal member of the kingdom and if you this post 10minutes you may be too.\n\nBefore he was known as **King Jonas**, he was simply **Jcardcollector96**, a 29-year-old from Beverly Hills, CA who entered the sports card hobby in 2018 with passion, money, warmth, and an unguarded heart.\n\nHis rise on Whatnot Sports intertwined with a woman many in the hobby came to know as Gianna — **\"HobbyPrincess\"**. They were not merely collaborators on stream; they were lovers, partners beyond the screen—an unlikely pair who shared late calls, Las Vegas vacations, grand dreams, and a spark that collectors still whisper about. Their bond was intense and lasted 3 months, but when it fractured, the hobby itself took notice.\n\nIn the aftermath of their break-up, rumors swelled like storm clouds. Across Whatnot, Reddit, Instagram, Medium, TikTok and Facebook, strangers spun tales—some dramatic, some delusional, many untrue. Narratives were twisted, intentions distorted and lies took flight faster than facts could walk. Yet Jonas chose not to drown in that noise. He chose creation. He chose rebirth. He chose the Kingdom...\n\nTo stumble upon **King Jonas’** hall on Whatnot is not a mere scroll-by—it is to cross the threshold into a Kingdom reborn.\n\n\n\n[Shows · jcardcollector96 · JCardCollector96 LLC · Whatnot: Shop, Sell, Connect](https://www.whatnot.com/user/jcardcollector96/shows)\n\n\n\nWhere once there was only heartbreak and exile, now rises a sovereign court adorned with **$100,000s in prized inventory**, a growing legion of **loyal Knights**, and nightly Royal Decrees (“givveaways”) that send the chat into roars of triumph.\n\nThe sports breaks & packs that are ripped become battles; the slabs and big hits are grails, spoils of war; and the marketplace itself, a proving ground where the King now commands a massive following, **20,000+ followers** and he defends his Kingdom against rival realms.\n\nBut the true power of the Kingdom is not only in its treasure vaults or its victories—it is in the culture forged in the chat. Seasoned Knights and curious travelers alike find a welcome at court. The tone is warm, the camaraderie lively, and the banter forged not for exclusion but for fellowship. In a world where many streams feel cold, transactional, and uninspired, the Kingdom stands as a rare stronghold of connection, energy, and authentic passion for the hobby.\n\nEach show unfolds like a chapter in an ever-evolving saga. Cards are revealed with suspense, oddities emerge from sealed relics, and surprises drop like sudden proclamations from the throne. No loyal Knight knows what decree, duel, or treasure will come next, and that very unpredictability makes the Kingdom’s battles worth witnessing in real time.\n\nTo visit **King Jonas’** domain is to witness a streamer who did not merely survive the trials of heartbreak... he turned personal pain & drama into lore. And it is precisely that blend of **storytelling, scale, sales skills, and spirit** that keeps collectors returning night after night, not only to collect—but to belong... to the Kingdom!!\n\n🏰THE KINGDOM IS FOREVER🛡️",

Even if nothing was opened from the product they had slotted for that break, it is in Whatnot’s TOS that each slot will receive at the least one card. \n\nDon’t let people get away with not sending out what they are supposed to under the guise of “that’s the risk you take.” Because no, that is not how it works. The risk is that you pay some amount of money for a card worth 2 cents. And that is what it is. \n\nAnyway, tldr: don’t let them just steal your money for nothing. Sellers have to send an item if you buy a break slot. ",

After finding listings for the missing cards and adding them, I went to optimize and my two options contained 43 and 36 cards respectively. I didn't have this problem last time, and TCGplayer was bugging out a lot and refusing to let me add stuff to my cart. Is this a problem with TCGplayer servers or am I doing something wrong?

If my account has **any open invoice/fees** (not related to the specific items being transferred), can that **block transfers** or cause a hold?\n2. Can the **recipient’s account** get flagged/held if they receive a larger transfer from me?\n3. After transferring everything out, is it safe to **close my account**, and could that impact the recipient later?\n\nIf you’ve done P2P transfers on Fanatics Collect, I’d appreciate any experiences or things you wish you knew beforehand.

    "text": "A few days ago I came to know that one of my friends from engineering, was diagnosed with HIV.\n\nLet's call him \"**the unluckiest guy ever**\". \n\nI met him in 2013 in my college first year. He is from Bihar originally, but lives in Noida from his childhood.\n\nIn all my time of knowing him, he was always shy quiet type guy. Introvert type, never smoked, never drank, did not even eat meat, full vegetarian. We tried to drag him to the '**theka**' near our hostel numerous times but that MF wouldn't budge. \n\nNone of us had any girlfriends in college but he even looked like he doesn't have one. (For Civil and Mech Engineering it is a given)\n\nAfter college I moved near his home in Noida with 3 other friends from college, for work and we would hang out most weekends. (And play PUBG).\n\nSuffice to say, He never had any female interaction at all. Poor fucker. Now we were all working and had some money so visited THOSE kind of ladies too, but again this guy declined. Morals, he said. We all laughed, teasing him. \n\n\"Abey gay toh nahi h na tu?\" \n\n\"Aaja tuhje ladka dila denge\"\n\n\"Khada nahi hota kya\"\n\n**We were dumb idiots. I feel so dumb right now.**\n\nBut yes, he never went with us on our \"adventures\". Remained a virgin BC.\n\nThe only time I saw him get into some trouble was when he took a loan from a guy in hostel, about 15k and \"invested\" it somewhere and lost all of it and couldn't pay the guy back. I don't remember if he did or not, at all. \n\n**What I'm trying to tell is he is a VERY SIMPLE guy.** \n\n**Anyways**, cut to 2 years back, his family started looking for a girl for him, you know... arranged marriage. And after some search they selected someone from Delhi itself from his own caste and all.\n\nThey started talking and I guess liked each other. But I'm not sure how those talk went really because my man had no game really.\n\nWhen we asked \"**kya baatien karta h bhabhi se hume bhi dikha...?\"** He just got shy like a girl every-time.\n\nShe worked in some IT call centre in Delhi. They both liked each other and **a date** was set. And when that date came, the wedding was postponed because the girl got sick. Both families talked and set another date. And then it was postponed once again. **Wtf**.\n\nThen on a **third date**, they finally got married. Both seemed happy. Now this guy is 32 years old and his family is old school, so of-course they want a grandchild the very first night. \n\nI guess after sometime they really started 'trying'. Meanwhile he also completed the \"visit Goa\" achievement that every engineer dreams of. But with his wife.\n\nCut to 4-5 months after his wedding, he started having health difficulties himself. I never saw him catch a cold and now he would not stop coughing BC. In our weekend meets we joked \"**TB ho gaya kya l\\*de?**\"\n\nHe went for a check up one time, doc prescribed some basic medicines, no change. \n\nHe went back a second time, with even more brutal cold and cough, fever and whatnot, got tested properly this time and **BAM! He has HIV.** \n\nHe panicked as he didn't want his wife to have the same, took his wife to doc, she ALSO got it. \n\nFamily got the news, we all 4 got the news. \n\n**We were all thinking the same thing, he must have gotten it from the girl. There is no other way.** \n\nHis cousin is a thug type guy, researched a bit from his \"sources\" about the girl. Apparently, she was a passed around quite a bit (used to even live separate with her girlfriends, away from family, for her job, despite having her home in Delhi). This cousin told my friend's father. He called the girl's father to take her back. He obliged. My friend's father threatened with a case too. And then they threatened with a dowry case (**they gave a swift in \"dowry\"**).\n\n**And that's where we are right now.**\n\nHis father has taken him to Mumbai for treatment. They know someone there. His father had cancer treatment there, a few years ago. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**I used to think I'm unlucky but never have I ever seen a more unlucky guy.** \n\nI'm lowkey now scared myself that now I got it from him BC. I was sitting right fucking there when he was coughing. Fuck. But I'm scared to even go for a checkup. I've seen those commercials that it doesn't transfer from handshake and all but I don't believe that's true. It must have some effect. \n\n**I think his parents really really really failed him that they did not research enough about the girl. They fucked his whole life up.** \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TLDR-**\n\n**My friend, introvert, shy type guy, arranged marriage, got married to a girl with a severe past, got HIV from her and now is being threatened with a dowry case.** \n\nI've known him from past 13-14 years. I don't know what else to say. Stay safe bhai, and use protection everywhere I guess. \n\nIt is hard enough to ask a lady about her past in arranged marriage, I don't know how can a person even start to ask about an STD check before marriage. It simply cannot be done. The lady will simply break off the 'rishta' and feel disrespected. \n\n**Thank you for reading. Sorry for the long post.**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Have you ever known anyone with a similar unlucky life? What did they do?**\n\n**Are they Alive?**\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_",

    "text": "Hey everyone, i hope everyone had a great Christmas and New year. My name is Zac, i am a newer collector from Canada. I started collecting about 5 months ago and quickly fell in love with the hobby and ripping packs, learning the market, and sharing it with family has been an awesome experience. I’ve been an NFL fan my whole life (proud eagles fan 🦅) and i played cornerback for several years, so i am very passionate about sports especially football. Football cards are my main focus, but I also enjoy baseball, basketball, and soccer including the collegiate version of football and basketball. I’m finishing high school in a few months and would love to start building a small sports cards business or side hustle, i think it would be a great opportunity to learn how the industry works and gain experience and knowledge. I am very hard working, fast learning and a great negotiator and i think most importantly, i am passionate. Any help would mean a lot to me so feel free to contact me about anything. I’d also really appreciate advice on:\n\n• How you got started selling or trading\n\n•\tBest platforms for Canadians (eBay, Whatnot, shows, etc.)\n\n•\tShipping/packing efficiently and safely\n\n\t\n\n•\tAny common beginner mistakes to avoid\n\nI’m not sitting on a huge collection or big money, i am just trying to learn, work hard, and do things the right way. Any insight or experiences you’re willing to share would mean a lot. I know its not going to be easy and i am ready for it. I have a good sized collection with big hits and good pulls and everything is scanned and organized. If anyone wants to check it out i will be more than happy to show you. Thanks for taking the time to read, i really appreciate this community and i am looking forward to giving you guys updates on how it is going:) Contact me if you guys have any questions and have a great day!",

    "text": "I recently sold a card for $33.89 and as usual, for something under $50, I sent it PWE. I pack and drop off my orders at the same time everyday so everything is out within 24 hours. When I leave for the post office I mark the PWEs as shipped. \n\nThe day after I marked this order as shipped, I receive a message from the customer asking if I shipped and what the tracking number was. I informed them that I shipped the order yesterday and that I sent it PWE. They tell me that their mailman is a thief and if it doesn't have tracking they won't get the order. I tell them if they don't get the order by the estimated delivery time, we'll figure something out(I'd make them wait a couple more days and then refund them\"). \n\nToday they messaged me with a refund request saying that they don't trust that they'll receive their order since it doesn't have tracking and that they want a refund. It's only been 4 days since the order was shipped and today is a holiday. Do y'all think I should just refund them and take the loss or tell them to wait until the estimated delivery day? \n\nI know this is a part of the online seller game and I'm not too distraught about the money cause I'm really only $7 into this card, but I'd like some other opinions on the situation\n\nEDIT: I should have said I'm a seller with ~5k sale and I've sent hundreds of orders this size, this way. People almost always get their order and this is the first time someone has overtly tried to scam me like this. I'm going to make them wait and then escalate to TCGplayer before I refund.\n\nFor the people who are saying I should track everything that's over $20, this business would not be sustainable and no one would sell a large volume of cards on TCGplayer if this was enforced. \n\nThanks for the input everyone!",

    "text": "I was wondering how everyone did this year in the world of cardboard. What were your best purchases/strategies that panned out in 2025? What were some bad choices/failures/scams that ultimately wasted your time or lost some money? I have my wrap up below as more of a newbie in the space, but I am super interested in hearing people's stories. \n\n\n\nWins:\n\nI started in May of this year and have 25k cards listed in TCGPlayer. I bought 134k cards this year but have sorted all of them (still have 14k cards to list). I am now able to process cards quicker and have a wonderfully large garage shelf for storage.\n\nI bought a couple collections off of Facebook that really panned out. Some highlights include a $500 lot that turned into $5,000 and a $250 one that became $1,300. I picked up a bunch of Warhammer UB bulk for cheap which skyrocketed obviously.\n\nI hit 2,500 orders on TCGPlayer and 10.5k in sales this year. Hitting the max level and gold star seller really helped out on this front. I am around 12-15 orders a day now which is great for me (still small fry numbers). A chunk of these sales were not optimal though which is more so mentioned in the losses column.\n\nI got to meet a bunch of nice local MTG fans via deals and heard a lot about people's stories and strategies. It might not be the case for introverts but I love talking to customers or suppliers about anything cardboard.\n\n\n\nLosses: \n\nI was new to buying bulk and bought a bunch of crap off of eBay for little to no return. I bought cards at way above rate and had to work hard just to not lose money which wasted time. A lowlight included spending $150 on 5k cards which were obviously picked through. It taught me a lot about sourcing though and thankfully wasn't a big deal. \n\nBuying non windowed envelopes and spending hours handwriting addresses 500 times. Learned a lot about packing orders more efficiently from this haha.\n\nSome silly USPS issues that were partially my fault (losing around a 100-200 bucks). A highlight was getting a USPS damage claim rejected because I filed it wrong. In my defense, those forms are not easy and error out too much (curse you file size maxes!). I learned to give buyers the benefit of the doubt but to always be a bit suspicious of bad apples.\n\nA big one for me was not sorting great at the start so I had to go through a redo a bunch of my boxes. It is super important to have a good idea of what you want the end result to be before you start on big projects.\n\n\n\nOpportunities:\n\nIn 2026, my goal is to hit a ton of tag sales in the spring to see what I can find. I know it won't make me millions but I am excited to dumpster dive for the white whale lots. \n\nAfter I get through these final 14k cards, I plan on spreading a bunch of local ads about my willingness to buy collections. Hopefully people can starting coming to me with offers sometimes instead of me endlessly scrolling FB marketplace.\n\nI will continue to refine my bulk strategy and hopefully improve my margins further this next year.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\n2,574 sales (and counting) with only 8 full refunds\n\n99.9% rating overall (one salty eBay review, 2,573 without issues)\n\n10.6k in revenue \n\n2.8k in profit\n\n650 bucks in cash flow (should be much higher next year without startup costs)",

Then in 2023 it jumped from $185 a box north of $275. I only got one case. Then last year it was $350 a box. I just bought two individual boxes. \n\nFast forward to 2025 and we’re now at $549 a box. Up 295% from its release pricing just three years ago. \n\nFor the first time, I won’t be buying any boxes at all. \n\nMichael Rubin and Fanatics are a cancer on this hobby. They’ve gone full heel turn and taken on the villain role; and he doesn’t even pretend to give a shit. \n\nHe’s catering exclusively to breakers. He’s basically told me; and all the other average everyday buyers of wax, that we’re no longer needed. \n\nPlease. I’m asking you. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. \n\nSTOP BUYING INTO BREAKS. STOP PAYING THE INSANE PRICES THAT FANATICS IS SELLING FOR. \n\nIf you all keep buying; they’ll keep raising prices higher and higher; with no end in sight. \n\nSAVE THE HOBBY. STOP BUYING TOPPS/FANATICS. \n\nAnd before all you “it’s free market economics blah blah blah” people chime in… no. It’s not. \n\nThe Hobby has become a casino. It’s gone from an industry who sold to fathers and sons; to one that uses every trick in the book to make you believe you’re one pack away from life changing money. The lights. The noise. The breaker screaming at the top of their lungs. The bullshit “that spot is paid” (when it’s def not). It’s all a psy-op to get you more addicted to the point you can’t stop. \n\nThe one and ONLY thing that will combat this; is to stop buying. Period. ",

You post a thread of what you have, what you want, and usually trades are of equal value with one person putting some money in to cover the difference if it doesn't come even. You would mail with toploaders and whoever had the lower rep on the site would send first.\n\n\nFrom what I hear though, Pojo is sort of ancient history and 'everyone gets their cards from TCGPlayer now'. I have a lot of value in my collection but am trying to minimize money spent. I have about 15-20 cards to obtain within the next two months. \n\n\nThe goat discord for trading doesn't seem to see enough trading traffic. Pojo seems like not the place anymore. Card shops tend to give like ~60% value to buy cards which is pretty rough. And becoming a seller on TCGPlayer seems pretty rough.\n\n\nSo I'm curious, are there any avenues for trading out there? How do you all obtain your cards now? What do you do with cards you don't need that hold value that you want to exchange?",

    "text": "Whenever someone asks, “How do you ship a sports card valued over $20?”\n\nIf it’s a card valued over $19.99 or in a slab (or even 1-3 cards in this range), this is how I ship them for maximum protection:\n\n1. Put the card and a Dad Man's Dugout sticker in a team bag.\n\n2. Secure the card between 2 pieces of cardboard for extra stability.\n\n3. Wrap it all with a rubber band to hold everything in place.\n\n4. Include my handwritten thank-you note: I thank the customer for their purchase, ask them to follow my eBay store, Whatnot account, and social media. I also provide 1 or 2 fun facts about the player and ask for their feedback.\n\n5. Place it in a bubble mailer, then nest that inside another bubble mailer for double protection.\n\n6. Add a \"Fragile: Handle with Care\" sticker on the outside.\n\nFor cards valued under $20, I keep it simpler with a team bag, folded paper case, and painter's tape inside a thank-you card (check my other video for details!). \n\nI'll upload more videos soon!

I’ve been selling on eBay for a long time, mostly sneakers, Supreme, vinyl art driven toys and Hot Wheels etc. I’m by no means a newbie to eBay but I’ve never sold cards before. I was also considering Whatnot but only from a store perspective, I have zero interest in the business of breaking, although I enjoy watching it. I find the platform easy to use.\n\nI’ll probably just sell slabs as I have thousands of singles to sort through. I buy what I like, but I think it’s best to stick with my favorite drivers at this point. I’m an entrepreneur in real life so even with collecting I typically buy right with the idea of getting out whole, or even with some profit, which I just roll into more purchases, it’s a crazy cycle but I enjoy it.\n\nAnyway I’ve looked at the sellers I’ve purchased from, and most seem to be large organizations. In my head I’m playing around with shipping, do I go free or somewhere in the middle.? I hate when I buy something and it ships first class without tracking, I absolutely want to use  ground advantage and probably boxes for everything. I’m a little surprised everybody uses bubble mailers, bulk boxes, especially small aren’t that expensive. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone here sells on eBay and had any tips. I’ve always been pretty good with comping my items so it’s really more the logistics that have me thinking about things, thanks!",

    "text": "For some context...I'm not sure if this kind of thing seems important to you guys. To give you some context, it is a very old domain (more than 24 years old). As a digital strategy and SEO guy, I would say its quite a missed opportunity...it used to belong to this American guy that was using it as his personal \nwebsite, not keen to sell, but he let it expire, then it went into auction. If you're not a domain investor, you might consider $2759 pretty expensive, but for a national treasure and \"jiwa bangsa\" I would say its a really good price. I unfortunately got to know about the auction during the last 5 minutes.\n\nPantas.com sold for $5000, Pinjam.com for $7500, Merdeka.com for $3000...so $2759 for Bahasa.com is quite a bargain. Whoever owns it now can easily charge 10x what they bought for it, and define the term Bahasa, and most likely an Indonesian will buy it. Because thats what happened to Merdeka.com, sad isn't it...such a meaningful word.\n\nWould you have spent the money? I see a lot of people here passionate about Bahasa, and owning something like that would essentially mean the ability to define the language and coin new words...people would trust the first search engine result more than DBP. \n\nI personally think thar \"defending Bahasa\" is less about arguing what is and isn't culture, and being able to define the term and ensuring the usage of the words and language survive future generations. Having a business or startup with a Bahasa term is one way to define its meaning, like what I plan to do with Soal.my. Indonesia's attempt to claim the Kebaya (yes the dress)  their national heritage was led by their countries national domain registrar, of all gov agencies. \n\nAt that time they used kebaya.id as the campaign site, which works really well cause .ID doesn't just connotate Indonesia, it connotates identity too. Of course UNESCO didn't let them claim it. But they did try. Its kind of sad how I used to build websites on Merdeka.com but my friend sold it cause he needed the money. Its Indonesia's biggest media portal now btw. \n\nI'm aware this a really obscure hobby, and most people misunderstand it. But if there was any way to learn the language, and have fun and make money at the same time, buying/selling and developing worthy names into high traffic sites would be the way. If you're keen to learn though, do let me know. ",

    "text": "I’ve been in the hobby for a while and mostly buy singles, but I wanted to try Fanatics Collect’s Instant Rip just to see how everything works. Dropped $250 on a basketball pack just out of curiosity.\n\nI actually pulled a legit grail: a 2014 LeBron James patch card. Their system immediately showed a “value” around $1,400, which made no sense at all. Realistic value is maybe $500 to $600. So I skipped their whole end-of-process valuation and took the $1,200 instant credit. That part was easy.\n\nEverything after that… not great.\n\nThe user interface feels like it was designed by someone who doesn’t collect. It’s clunky, the layout is strange, and finding basic info takes more taps than it should. Their weekly auction structure also feels odd. Maybe there’s a reason for it, but from the outside it just seems limiting.\n\nTheir Card Ladder pricing is rough. They’re pulling comps from 2022, so you basically have to bounce between eBay and their app to figure out real values. It slows everything down and makes it hard to trust what you’re looking at.\n\nI used my $1,200 credit toward an overpriced 1980 Topps Bird–Magic–Dr. J rookie PSA 7 listed at $1,600. I paid the extra $400 cash to cover the difference and added it to my collection. Cool.\n\nThen I tried to withdraw it.\n\nThey hit me with a $75 fee.\n$48 to “withdraw” the card, with no explanation or breakdown.\n$25 shipping.\nPlus tax.\n\nPaying $75 just to get a card in hand is wild. It makes the whole thing feel like a cash grab built on keeping you inside their ecosystem and charging you every time you try to leave it.\n\nAt this point I’m deleting the app and won’t be using it again. That’s just my experience, but it was enough for me.",

Since Fanatics acquired them in 2022 I feel Topps and their other brands Allen & Ginter and Bowman have just fallen off. \n\nBased off of the reactions I saw yesterday over the Topps Cosmic Chrome release I feel Fanatics is just after nothing but money. The huge price alone was one thing but then the lack of guarantees of auto or relics just blew my mind. I grew up ripping packs with my dad and loving every second of it but now… I mean these prices and then being told “hey you might only get base cards” is a wild wild approach. ",

My biggest question is are we going to keep getting Topps brand basketball cards or is Fanatics going to release their own line? Is Panini still going to release all its same lines season, but unlicensed? And what happens to all the premium/unique lines like immaculate, national treasures, court kings, black, etc.  Panini had so many lines that took them so many years to build, do you guys think we’re just going to have one or two tops basketball lines for the next few seasons? And then what happens to all the penny cards that exist with a licensing? Will they eventually lose any value? So many questions! Thanks!",

And 5 Reasons Comic Collection Platforms Beat Spreadsheets (and Raw AI)\n\nDon't ditch your collection management platform just yet! AI can help you discover some fun insights about your collection, but you still need a source of data to track, update and manage your comic books.\n\n**TL;DR – Why Comic Collection Platforms Beat Spreadsheets**\n\n* **Real-time values:** Get automatic pricing updates from live market data—no more manual research or outdated estimates.\n* **Smarter cataloging:** Add issues instantly using built-in databases with covers, variants, and creator details.\n* **Visual browsing:** View your collection as a gallery instead of a grid of cells—filter, sort, and enjoy the art.\n* **Always in sync:** Access your full collection anywhere with cloud backups and instant device sync.\n* **Community connection:** Discover new books, share collections, and compare notes with other collectors.\n* **Less work, more fun:** Ditch the spreadsheets—spend less time managing data and more time enjoying the hobby.\n\n# 1) Real-Time Valuation and Market Insight\n\nDedicated platforms pull in regularly refreshed pricing so you can see estimated fair-market value, recent movers, and trends at a glance. With a spreadsheet, you’d need to hunt values yourself, paste them in, and maintain error-prone formulas … every time.\n\n# 2) Streamlined, Error-Free Cataloging\n\nTools like [Zap-Kapow Comics Club](https://club.zapkapowcomics.com/) and [CLZ](https://clz.com/) use robust issue databases—creators, variants, barcodes, cover art—so adding books is fast and consistent. No typos, no duplicate rows, no broken VLOOKUPs.\n\n# 3) Visual and Interactive Experience\n\nCover galleries, rich filters, and “owned vs. wanted” views make collecting delightful and practical. Spreadsheets are utilitarian; dedicated apps make your collection feel like a collection.\n\n# 4) Cloud Sync and Cross-Device Access\n\nYour data is available on phone, tablet, and desktop with automatic backup and instant sync. Spreadsheets splinter into versions—*v3\\_final\\_FINAL.xlsx*—and fall out of date fast.\n\n# 5) Built-In Community and Discovery\n\nRecommendations, related issues, and optional sharing help you find what’s next and compare notes with other collectors. Spreadsheets can’t replicate that ecosystem … or the fun.\n\n# Bottom Line\n\nSpreadsheets are flexible but high-maintenance. A purpose-built comic platform gives you pricing, structure, visuals, sync, and community out of the box—so you can spend less time wrestling cells and more time collecting.",

We soft-launched 3 months ago and have started sharing our tool with the smaller TCG communities, but we feel that the time has come to share it with the Riftbound community before the big launch.  \n  \n**👉** We’re opening 200 early-access invites to the Riftbound community here: [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=riftboundtcg](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=riftboundtcg)\n\n**We're giving away 1  Origins Booster Box to one of the first 200 player who:**\n\n1. Joins via the invite link\n2. Adds some cards to their collection\n3. Creates a list (trade / wishlist / decklist — your choice!)\n\nOur marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker will stay free forever. We're in this for the long haul - building the tools we wish existed to easily build decks, trade cards, and understand where your portfolio stands.\n\nWe're still in beta, and we're really looking for some feedback/ideas to improve it, especially from the early Riftbound community. What features would make this invaluable for you?\n\nNB: We have an active community on our Discord where you can provide feedback (see on our landing page), not yet on Reddit.",

The only thing wrong with this card is the centering on the back is off right to left.

I’ve held onto this card since I got it in a pack when I was a freshman in high school in 79-80 waiting to sell it. It looks like a defect on the top but it’s the lighting and reflection. The edges are all clean, the colors are still bright, it’s centered on the front almost perfect. There are no spots. I’m just devastated with this grade.

    "text": "My youth was during the junk wax era (1985-1996) and the market had a hard crash. During the peak in the 1990s, even specialty stores and grocery stores carried a lot of cards. The only thing worth buying in the 90s, cards wise, was MTG but even MTG was hit by it. Homelands and Fallen Empires didn’t help. There were lots of TCGs trying to make it big like MTG but the bust crushed most of them by 1999.\n\nDuring the mid 90’s, a lot of MSM stories were done about card shows and people making $ by flipping right before the bottom fell out. They called it “buying and selling” back in our old fogey language. \n\nWell, I’m thinking we are at that same point again as CNBC has done its 3rd story on it after Kevin O’Leary talked about it 3-4 months ago. Are we at the top with next year bringing us a severe beating? I don’t think Xmas is ruined but the Pokebros have screwed up the MTG market and I see their home market as the root cause of the next downturn. It’s overprinted, overpriced and sold in grocery stores and sporting goods stores now. I’m looking to get out now with Xmas sales and but swing back around just for the Hobbit and duck out. Are the whatnot crews still selling or has it calmed down?",

A little over a month ago I bought a break spot with Swish Breaks on Fanatics Live. In the break I  hit a Keon Coleman RPA  /25. A week or so later I received an empty bubble mailer. I reached out to Swish Breaks. They let me know they made an error and sent the card out to the wrong address. They stated they were having the card sent back to them and then they would send to me. I reached out again about a week later and they responded they were still waiting on the card. I reached out again a week after that to get an update and they did not respond. After several days of no response from Swish Breaks I reached out to Fanatics support. They responded quickly and offered me a credit.  I declined the credit as I stated I had no reason to use their app anymore if they were going to allow their sellers to act in bad faith. They then offered to double the initial credit offer (value was more than the card was worth) to which I politely declined again based on the reason I previously stated. In defense of Fanatics Live I will say after years of occasional breaking this is the only issue I have had and they did quickly respond and offer a remedy. To me though, I only break with sellers that operate in good faith and Swish Breaks broke that trust. FL support stated they “reported” Swish Breaks for the incident but I wanted to let everyone in here know they are not a good faith seller. ",

I’m concerned about where my money is going to go on the orders I already sold. I calculated it and I’ve sold $430 worth of cards in about 17 orders. I know it’ll take a while for them to put it in my account but it’s now saying there is a hold on my payments too. Are they just keeping the money from my card sales?

I recently got an acrylic case delivered, so I finally took it out of the tin and plastic wrap that I was keeping it safe in. Though it is has some slight wear and a couple small splits in the corners, it's still my gem! Just started playing the Early Days Collection on Switch because of all the nostalgia.\n\nI can't help but wonder how many of these could be out there. There's very few sales of the first run with the GOAT promos, most coming from Heritage Auctions.

I am interested in doing some trading, and to start, I was thinking that I would offer a 1.5x trade-in credit for items on my list.\n\nFor example, if you have a card on my list worth $3, I would trade you $4.50 dollars worth of cards from my inventory. This will allow me to clear space, and give you all some good deals.\n\nHigh Priority Wishlist:\n\n* Constellar Ptolemy M7\n* Crossout Designator\n* D/D/D Wave High King Caesar\n* Fabled Levilazebul\n* Fabled Lurrie\n* Forbidden Droplet\n* Nibiru the Primal Being\n* P.U.N.K.

    "text": "I’m pretty new to magic, I started last month with a friend and we’ve been enjoying it so far. He got into it cause of arena and the collabs, while I got into it because I love Final Fantasy, especially FF7. So because of my love for FF and FF7, I naturally want to collect all the FF7 cards. So I went onto tcgplayer and looked at the Sephiroth cards. I saw the full art Fabled Soldier and instantly fell in love with the look of the card but the price threw me off. $70 for a card seems so insane to me that I threw away the idea right away. \n\nSo fast track to today, I go to a card shop to just go look around and maybe get a commander set or a few singles and that’s when I saw the full art foil borderless Sephiroth Fabled Soldier. I asked how much it was and ofc it was $75. I said that’s a bit much for me and went home. When I got home I was talking to my mom about it and how I don’t understand why cards are so expensive. Just normal talk yk.\n\nWell she went out to get groceries and without me knowing, went to the card shop and asked about it. Well she bought it, she bought the $75 card. I’m very grateful and I was extremely happy but now I feel guilty. I don’t like that she bought it because it bothers me that she spent $75 on a card when that money could’ve been used for something else. \n\nI’ve been thinking of returning the card and getting her money back because even though I love the card, I can’t even touch it without feeling wrong. Ik it’s just a card and in all reality it’s not that deep but I bothers me so much that I would much rather shred the card than keep it at this point. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you think I’m overthinking and overreacting?\n\nTLDR: Mom buys $75 card and I want to return it because spending that much on a card makes me feel terrible and the fact I didn’t buy it using my own money is eating at me.\n\n(Edit) I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did. I am having trouble answering all 600+ people in the comments but I want everyone to know that I appreciate all of your responses and I’m now leaning more towards keeping the card. I just wish I could thank everyone of you individually and answer everyone. I still would appreciate anyone else who would like to share their opinions on this matter.",

    "text": "Just wanted to share my negative experience with \"Break'n Bad\" on fanatics live as an FYI to others. Since July I have spent over $925 with that shop purchasing various online cards breaks including one where I paid a little over $37 for a Topps Chrome Jumbo pack. I received the package on time but it only contained cards pulled from other orders I placed with them and no Jumbo Pack (I did receive a second Jumbo Pack I bought in a separate purchase/shipment just fine the same week). I messaged them through the fanatics site, got a couple replies including \"our shipping team may have just missed including that pack\", but its now been a week with no follow-up or resolution from them. I just filed a complaint with Fanatics, hoping they can help get this resolved, but its a let down to spend that much money with someone only to end up getting ignored when things go wrong. That's not the customer service someone would expect when a company drops the ball. Until this point, my experience with them was otherwise positive, but when someone doesn't fix their mistake that's a deal breaker for me, so I will not be purchasing again from them and will likely stop the whole site altogether, if fanatics can't make it right.\n\nUpdate 9/16/25: I filed a claim with Fanatics-live as previously stated (who responded very quickly) and received an update from the shop shortly thereafter (not sure if it was cause-and-effect or not). Just got a replacement jumbo pack from the shop, so they did ultimately make good on their end. Overall, its good to see both the shop and fanatics provide resolution, but it did unfortunately result in having to jump through several extra hoops on my side.",

    "text": "Dear r/mtgfinance Community,\n\nWe are three friends passionate about Magic (and a few more TCGs since then) who quit our day jobs late last year to fulfill an old dream of starting our own company.  \n  \nAfter years of playing Magic competitively and trading cards at events across the US, we kept running into the same problems. Tracking our collection values was a mess of spreadsheets. Organizing trades meant juggling TCGPlayer tabs and scattered notes. And we never really knew our portfolio's true performance over time.\n\nSo we built CardNexus - a modern portfolio tracker designed specifically for serious TCG players and collectors who care about value.\n\n**What we've built for MTG:**\n\n* A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch)\n* Week-on-week portfolio tracking - see  how your collection's value changes over time\n* Real-time price tracking synced with the two major marketplaces\n* Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early\n* Custom lists for trades and deck building\n* Support for all MTG formats and sets (plus 5 other TCGs if you're diversified, such as Sorcery, Flesh and Blood, One Piece, Lorcana, and Pokemon)\n\n**This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on user feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 7 weeks ago and have started sharing our tool with the smaller TCG communities but we feel that the time has come to share it with the MTG community. \n\n**Today, we're opening 200 beta spots specifically for the** r/mtgfinance **community.**\n\n**The hook:** We're giving away a $200 MTG booster box (your choice from TCGPlayer) to one lucky member who joins via our link, uploads their collection, and creates a trade list! \n\nGet your invite here: [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=mtgfinance](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=mtgfinance)\n\nOur marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker will stay free forever. We're in this for the long haul - building the tools we wish existed to easily build decks, trade cards, and understand where your portfolio stands. [tps://discord.com/invite/xfDUvn5g2g](https://discord.com/invite/xfDUvn5g2g)\n\nWe're still in beta, and we're really looking for some feedback/ideas to improve it, especially for the MTG community.  What features would make this invaluable for you r/mtgfinance community? \n\nNB: We have an active community on our Discord where you can provide feedback (see on our landing page), not yet on Reddit: [https://discord.com/invite/xfDUvn5g2g](https://discord.com/invite/xfDUvn5g2g)\n\n",

    "text": "Normally I hate the bandwagon of \"I hate TCG/WOTC/CK/ETC\" posts but today I'm driving the bus.\n\nWhat the hell are we paying for with TCGPlayer Direct?\n\n# Act I: Card Availability\n\nFor roughly the past 12 months, the availability of Magic cards on TCGPlayer Direct plummeted. First they started dropping everything outside of the \"currently in print\" sets. Older cards, promo cards, etc.\n\nThen, you couldn't even get the most recent set - high demand pushed even basic commons and uncommons out of availability for Direct packages. Today, I cannot get half of EOE through Direct. Most of the chase foils / borderless foils / etc. are marked up 50-150% from the non-Direct offerings. It's at the point where I'm lucky if I can get 1-2 cards at a time in the same direct package when I'm building a deck.\n\nWith absolutely no consistent stock, and with a majority of cards across the entire game unavailable, even qualifying for your perks is impossible unless you're playing Thunder Junction Block Constructed.\n\n# Act II: Shipping\n\nOk, I found my card and it's available and I place an order. Problem solved? NO!\n\nAt minimum there's a 7-day wait before my cards ship. During Final Fantasy, this exploded to 20-30 days of waiting for packages to ship. I know they moved locations to Louisville during this time, so I was patient, but that was three months ago and I have cards I ordered 10 days ago sitting there with \"Shipping Not Confirmed.\"\n\nWhen they do ship, I get a \"tracking number.\" It doesn't track packages, it doesn't even confirm that the carrier has the package at all - it just returns errors. TCG says this is \"a unique tracking code that we can track internally while the shipment is prepared\" - what?  \n  \nThe tracking number MIGHT update AFTER the package is delivered. So I waited 2-5 weeks for my cards to arrive, with no tracking. What am I paying for Direct for?\n\n# Act III: Robo-Hailey\n\nWhen I do have issues, I reach out to customer service, and in the past I would be very helpfully and happily answered by Hailey from TCGPlayer. It was a great bonus of the service and \"TCG Has your back\" was a good mantra for buyers from the program's inception to around January 2025.\n\nToday, I get what I call \"Robo-Hailey\" (no slight to the real Hailey, if indeed she exists). I get spun around and around with automated responses. These responses are completely disconnected from my questions.\n\nIf I write and ask \"hey, how come you haven't shipped my package after seven days\" I get an unrelated boilerplate AI response about carrier delays. Guess what, it's not March 2020, there are no carrier delays, all my non-TCG packages are arriving just fine. The carrier can't have a delay if you don't hand them a package!\n\nI have started flagging anything I say as \"other\" because it's the only way to get eyes on the question, days later.\n\n# Epilogue\n\nI'm not an unreasonable person. TCG Direct was worth every penny when they started, and for years afterwards. I am not sure why the quality has declined to this point, but I've reached my threshold. Literally every line of text in their description of the Direct service is now a lie:\n\n1. Free Tracked Shipping: No, it's not tracked at all.\n2. Your Order Ships First: First?? I'd hate to see how long it takes for orders shipped last!\n3. Extra Store Credit: Used to be. Now there's a $35 threshold before the package qualifies. I have gone multiple months without triggering it at all. They also used to stack bonuses for subscribers - that happens MAYBE once a year now? From 2023-2024 I covered my subscription cost with store credit and now I get almost nothing. This perk has evaporated.\n4. Earn Subscriber-Only Promos Throughout the Year: What? Where? Has anyone seen these? I have been a subscriber since the MONTH THEY LAUNCHED and I have never received a promo, ever.\n5. Cards are Graded By Our Experts: I have more issues with card quality from TCGPlayer Direct than I do from mom and pop sellers outside the service.\n\n# Say it louder for the people in the back: What Are We Paying For?",

Some fun chases, but possible \"scarcity overload?\"\n\nThe overall landscape for retail Chrome this year does not look good for value. If you must purchase retail, I recommend Fanatics Megas if at all possible.\n\n1. Autos are seeded at 1:5 boxes compared to 1:9.5 boxes in regular mega & 1:7.5 boxes blasters.\n2. Production of Fanatics Mega is about 9% that of reg megas. (210k pks vs 2.4m pks)\n3. Fanatics Megas contain 10 Topps Refractors (PR \\~1000ea), vs 10 X-Fractors in reg megas (PR \\~12k ea). So they should hold better value. However this may be based too much on logic as there are a couple things working against the \"Topps Refractors\" holding solid value-\n\na) Consumers must realize the scarcity in relation to other unnumbered refractors and unfortunately there are a number of other \"logo-style refractors\" (both Chrome and paper versions) with varying rarities they can easily be lumped in with. Personally, I have to look at my extensive notes to remind myself of the differences on these so how is the average consumer supposed to know?\n\nb) If you have tried searching ebay for these \"Topps refractors\", you know it's super wonky and there's no good way to do so. I feel if Topps could have come up with a catchier name or style for these, it would help mightily, but they seem destined to get lost in the mix even though they are quite short printed.\n\n4) Fanatics Megas are the only format with a chance at Authentics Redemptions, which touts a nice checklist of subjects, but probably still does not justify the $80 premium price point.\n\nComparing 2025 Topps Chrome base production to prior years (does not include base from Logofractor boxes):  \n2025 (300 card set): 120,682  \n2024 (300 cards): 122,064  \n2023 (220 cards): 154,491  \n2022 (220 cards): 176,635  \n2021 (220 cards): 136,554  \n2020 (200 cards): 106,664\n\nWhen figuring print runs, I found it peculiar that base print runs (prior to adding Logofractor) were nearly identical for 2025 & 2024. Yet it seems like numbered cards and quality hits are so much tougher in 2025.\n\nSo I added up all unnumbered refractors + base inserts + all inserts with a print run of 500+ (so this includes case hits like Ultraviolet & Fanatical), for both 2025 Chrome & 2024 Chrome as increasing these can greatly affect production numbers without adding to base print runs.\n\n2025- 24.45m cards  \n2024- 17.95m cards  \nYOY diff- +6.5 million cards, or +36.2%\n\nThis is equivalent to 1.625m extra hobby packs (or 1.08m extra Mega packs) worth of extra minor parallels and inserts MORE THAN LAST YEAR. This is where the true bloat comes from and why I believe 2025 Topps Chrome is one of the worst Chrome releases in quite some time, even more so than the lackluster rookie class. \n\nTo break that down further, here are the print run increases of the most common unnumbered parallels:\n\nRefractor  \n2025: 15,670  \n2024: 12,961  \n\\+20.9%  \n  \nX-Fractors  \n2025: 11,623  \n2024: 6,868  \n\\+69.2%  \n  \nPrism Refractors  \n2025: 5,567  \n2024: 6,727  \n\\-17.2%  \n  \nRaywave  \n2025: 14,733  \n2024: 3,758  \n\\+292%  \n  \nSepia  \n2025: 12,409  \n2024: 5,752  \n\\+115.7%\n\nOverall production is only up about 11% (61.83m cards in 2025 vs 55.72m cards in 2024), but that's comprised almost entirely of unnumbered parallels. This is why the format with by far the biggest production increase is the Mega Box (+83.8% YOY when adding in Fanatics Megas). Mega boxes average 16.5 parallels/box, second only to Jumbos at 21/box. To compare, Hobby only has 8.66 parallels/box and Value Boxes average 11.25 parallel/box.\n\nMoral of the story- do not be duped by the \"loaded feel\" of blasters & megas because they have \"sooo many parallels bro\". Those parallels are dog shit.",

    "text": "I am desperately in need of some guidance if anyone can help. I have an appointment with Heritage Auctions this week regarding my late father's coin collection, and my husband has asked me to bring these along.                  Let me preface this by saying I have not been researching coins for very long.Tomorrow will be the first time I have seen my father's collection. I knew he had one, I guess I just always thought about it in the abstract.                                                                                      Back to the pennies.While I know you don't come across error coins every day, I know there are a lot that probably slip through the cracks. My husband likes to put away anything he finds interesting. These are the two best examples of coins he has saved, at least for photos. Most I have to view through a jeweler's loupe to discern the difference. The color difference is obvious, I'm just not sure what that means. I would love to hear any opinions you may have on them.                                   I have read all the reviews of Heritage, and I need to know I won't be walking in there unprepared. I will have less than a week to review my dad's collection, and I would like to be sure I have some basic knowledge  before I get there.                                                                    Having said that, I may be reaching out for more advice in the next few days. Any help would be appreciated.Thanks in advance for your time:)",

    "text": "Hey guys, check this out! This post isn't meaning to be a Buy, Sell or Trade post - meant more as a News and Links post \n\n**G.I. Joe Snake Eyes v1 Strait Arm with Cobra Commander Offer AFA 85 \\*\\* POP 4, Highest Grade \\*\\* (Hasbro, 1982).** One of the most iconic action figures of the 1980s, Snake Eyes made his debut in Hasbro's 1982 relaunch of *G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero* as part of the original 9-back assortment. With his all-black commando gear, mysterious masked appearance, and silent-but-deadly persona, Snake Eyes quickly became a defining figure in the line, cementing his legendary status in both toy and comic book history. This version features the early Cobra Commander mail-away offer, placing it among the earliest packaging variants for the character. Graded AFA 85 Y-NM+ with subgrades of C80 B85 F90, this example is a POP 4 and stands as the highest graded example known to exist, with none graded higher. The yellowed bubble is typical for early G.I. Joe releases but remains clear and intact, and the overall presentation is exceptional. An absolute grail for G.I. Joe collectors, early cardback enthusiasts, or anyone building a top-tier run of the most important characters in action figure history, this is a flagship piece that rarely appears in this condition. A definitive version of a pop culture icon.  \n  \nHeritage Auctions provides as much information as possible but strongly encourages in-person inspection.

    "text": "Alt’s (alt.xyz) “auction model” is straight-up comedy — if it wasn’t so scammy.\n\nI joined an auction. The page screamed: *“Ends at 6:00 PM PT.”* Timer hit zero. Spoiler: it didn’t end. The clock just kept resetting like some busted alarm clock from 2002. No visible bids, just endless “extensions.”\n\nI asked support and their answers got progressively more ridiculous:\n\n* *“Users are familiar with this function.”* Translation: the veterans already know the timer is fake, congrats rookie.\n* *“We hear you and are ready to defend our model.”* Translation: “Yes, our clock lies, but we’ll fight you for it.”\n* And the grand finale: *“If any card gets a bid, the entire auction resets. Not just the card you’re watching —* ***any card*** *in the event.”*\n\nSo let me get this straight:\n\n* I’m bidding on a grail card.\n* Some clown lowballs a random $5 bid on a common nobody wants.\n* Suddenly my auction resets.\n* Rinse, repeat, forever.\n\nThat’s not an auction. That’s a hostage situation run by a stopwatch.\n\nIt’s like eBay saying: *“Sorry, your sneaker auction now lasts another 5 minutes because someone just bid on a toaster.”*\n\nThis whole setup is the holy trinity of scam energy:\n\n* Fake countdowns that never end.\n* Hidden bid logs so you can’t even tell if “reset bids” are real or ghosts.\n* An auction model that belongs in the year 2000 dot-com scam graveyard.\n\nAlt can call it “maximum exposure.” I call it “maximum clown show.” If your business model needs fake timers, invisible bids, and cross-lot hostage extensions, maybe the platform isn’t about fair auctions at all — it’s about milking urgency until people rage-quit.\n\nCollectors deserve transparency, not carnival-game psychology.\n\nAnyone else sick of Alt running auctions like a rigged slot machine?\n\n",

My oldest wants 'cute yet powerful Pokemons', and loves to open Pokemon related things, so packs, custom packs, tins, whatever we would be open too as well. English cards are generally preferred but foreign language cards could be considered.\n\n# Personal Wants\n\nI still am finishing up and getting framed some of my vintage sets.

    "text": "When I started collecting, I filled my case with tableware, scratch and dent pieces, and plates - soooo many plates - because that's what I could find. Then in my hunts I started to find rarer pieces, and items that had more of an artistic purpose rather than a utilitarian purpose. So out went the tableware and in went the artistic glass.\n\nI've been selling a lot of my uranium glass on ebay and Whatnot. I really enjoy selling it on Whatnot because it gives me the ability to chat with the people purchasing my items (both UV reactive and regular items). So now I've turned it into a legitimate small business. \n\nI'd like to invite you all to join me tonight at 6pm Central for my second Whatnot glow show, which I've appropriately named OnlyGlows. \n\nThere's lots of uranium and cadmium, with some manganese thrown in for good measure. Tonight's show will have many rare and hard to find pieces. Hope to see you there!\n\nhttps://whatnot.com/s/MlVguh5v",

I mean I’m doing $1/$2 starts for singles and I’m barely selling let alone breaking even. I changed my shipping settings so it’s lower. I continuously get people in my chat which are legit vultures, asking to pay $35 for a Luis Angel HFA and a Mookie ultraviolet COMBINED like bruh what? Then get mad at me. I feel like people swoop into my streams because I have low viewers and try to take advantage of me. Anyways I get like 2 or 3 people in my stream, max I’ve had is like 15. I’m about to just switch to eBay but I like the app and the idea of it so I’m looking for a little advice. Thanks \n\nUpdate: I am definitely stepping away from the card game on whatnot. After thinking about it and reading y’all’s comments some of yall are 100% correct it is not a smart business move, unless you are big and have connections. I will just put up one card on eBay and sold it within 5 hours for above what I was trying to get. Thanks guys. \nAlso f*** giveaways and shipping rookie mistake, I’ll stick to buying. Maybe I can be as predatory as all the people who hop in the lobby for a giveaway or ask 1/8 of the value of products. ",

Memorabilia redemptions are the only unique chase, but they’re extremely rare.\n\nPrice: Costs more than standard mega boxes despite fewer packs and lower overall EV.\n\nLesson: If you’re not chasing memorabilia redemptions, stick to hobby, jumbo, or standard megas—better odds, more packs, and actual chase potential.",

    "text": "*I posted on this mid the flurry and got several dozen DMs, now that I'm through I'm posting more details if others find it helpful.*\n\nI started casually selling on tcgplayer at the beginning of June to establish an account so I could sell my collection singles easily. I hit seller level 4 on 27 June.\n\nAround this time I ran some numbers and noticed a set of sealed products that averaged 260% value when sold as singles. I also noticed < 10 sellers were cracking and selling this, and it was not listed on mtgstocks or mox alpha. I sold the ones I had as a test run and as it worked, I rapidly ramped up the volume.\n\nI tracked seller volume, singles value and sealed value daily to get an idea of when to stop buying sealed, and figured I had about 4-5 weeks before the arbitrage was gone.\n\nMy predictions were fairly accurate, and by the end of July margin was < 40% before fees so I stopped aggressively pricing and selling.\n\nDid this for fun and to learn the seller market.\n\n# 4 week stats - 30 June to 30 July\n\n* Net sales: $29,604.34 \n* Orders: 1827 \n* Sealed products cracked: 70 \n* Net per order: $25.50 \n* Net after fees: $25,808.99 \n* Sealed cost basis: $14,100 \n* Postage, supplies: $2,500 \n* Profit: $9,208\n\n# Fulfillment Process\n\nHad a ton of fun doing trial and error on the packing and shipping process. By the end my speed maxed out at 30 orders in 60 minutes. This wasn't stable but > 20/hour was pretty consistent.\n\n* HP Laserjet B&W printer for packing slips\n* Thermal 4x6 label printer\n* 6 envelope for <= $50 orders\n* 4x8 bubble mailer for >= $50 orders\n* Pirateship for bubble mailer orders + tracking\n* Either stamps.com or tcgtracking.com + stamps.com for #6 envelope orders\n\n# Pulling\n\nBecause I was selling one set of sealed products with < 500 unique cards, I was able to use 2-4 card sorting trays, 1-4 slots per letter of the alphabet for rapid pulling. This made pulling a lot faster.\n\n# Packing\n\n* Top loaders\n* Shipping shields\n* Penny sleeves\n* Team bags\n* Larger team bags\n* Masking tape + dispenser\n* Packing tape + dispenser\n\nAll packing slips folded 3x into a 4.25 x 2.75 dimension.\n\nSingle cards penny sleeved and then top loaded, and slotted into the packing slip fold face down so the card can't escape. Masking tape seal around the packing slip and top loader to fix together. Expensive single cards also get a team bag over the top loader Multiple cards get either a shipping shield or go into team bag with top loader backing Large orders go in larger slab team bags. All variations wrapped around folded packing slip and taped to secure. Expensive orders get a slab team bag around the whole thing.\n\nAll envelopes taped over on the backside with packing tape.\n\nAfter everything is packed, I review the PWEs for fat ones and added on non-machinable postage or extra ounce postage as needed.\n\n# Errors / Learnings\n\n* Because I fold the packing slip to have 3 paper layers on either end, I experimented with slotting < $2.00 order single cards in the middle of the packing slip, slotted so there's only an opening on one side, and taping that over with masking tape. While I got no reports of damage, two people badly reviewed there was no top loader so I stopped doing this right after the feedback.\n* I had an original bias for shipping shields, but moved over more to toploaders as I found more non-machinable postage issues with the shields.\n\n# Fallout\n\n* 100% positive feedback by the end\n* 4 negative reviews in total managed to get them all removed with refunds / replacements / working with tcgplayer\n* \\~15 missing packages, \\~5 showed up later on, the rest refunded.\n* \\~20 envelopes returned due to postage issues, some valid, some not\n* 3 mis-filled orders, corrected\n* \\~5 people provided bad addresses, I paid postage again for reshipment\n* 3 people reporting quality issues.\n\nFeel free to ask any other questions or things I can provide more detail on.",

I’m trying to make selling on TCGPlayer a legitimate side hustle so I can make at least some money back on playing this game.  My ultimate goal is to make Yugioh at least somewhat of a self sustaining hobby, which means selling bulk instead of just the shiny cards.  I just have a few questions on how to actually make that transition.\n\n1. Storage.  That’s the biggest one, I need a more effective storage solution for my cards.  What do you guys use as effective and concise storage that keeps large amounts of product safe and easy to access?\n\n2. Shipping.  What do you guys use to ship larger orders?  Bubble mailers or just PWE?  Are there any particular products you guys use that are good for sending multiple cards at once?  Right now, with my larger orders being only 3 cards, I just send in PWE with a top loader.  Also, do you guys tend to use stamps or do you go into the post office and pay for shipping there?\n\n3. Pricing.  How do you guys to price the cards and shipping?  I know TCGPlayer is all about competitive pricing, so how do you guys price your cards to get buyers interested without losing money?",

Even when I do manage to do that, it is either 3 times the price of the deck in shipping, hitting the buy button removes five cards, or if i try to optimize it to decrease shipping, it takes out twenty cards. No shit it's cheaper it's not done. Please help.\n\nUpdate: I was able to work on it and got it to $10 under budged. Would have used cardmarket but it was more expensive and they were missing 5 cards. It was 100 card deck but I'm confused because the confirmation email says: \"Your [TCGplayer.com](http://TCGplayer.com) order of Shadowgrange Archfiend and 82 more items has processed.\" This implies that it cut seventeen cards, but they had a list below and I added the cards up and it reached 100.

I am sure all reading this are aware that TCGplayer  is very problematic in 2025 and you have a high chance of getting screwed nowadays. Just happened to me too, I ordered a display of 1st edition Yugioh decks and received 2 loose decks instead of 10 shrinkwrapped, a roughly $700 delta between what I paid for and what I received. \n\nI am not sure why everyone seems to think this is the place to complain when your TCGplayer purchase goes wrong? Why not the tcgplayer subs or the main magic sub?\n\nThis sub was much more useful and interesting when it was discussing card and sealed specs, online sales/shipping discussion and strategy, card investments and portfolios, ya know mtg finance stuff. Nowadays its reading like a TCGplayer complaints box and I don’t think it’s very constructive for us to be naming and shaming unscrupulous sellers one at a time, which will achieve approximately nothing, when really the whole platform should be boycotted so they adopt better policies and protections for both sides. Not to mention their seller interface is still basically 90s internet, which is why I haven’t sold there for years. Anyway I love you all fellow mages just want to see the quality of this sub back to what it was, and to stop seeing yall get ripped off, so lets take our business to another platform! Thanks for reading\n\nEDIT:  I forgot to mention in the original post that the actual data on problematic sellers can be useful if properly organized into a sheet, I made that sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ETZRIbg7_68_W44ozD7MromwudIRucRPpUCwtpOXXI/edit?usp=drivesdk). I suggest we link this on the FF scam posts so we can accrue something meaningful out of these negative experiences.",

The seller opens the pack live and out comes… a Pokémon card. I was totally thrown off because I’d been watching him rip these same packs for a while and every single one had sports cards.\n\nI double-checked the manufacturer’s website just to be sure—and sure enough, those Galaxy Silver packs are 100% sports only. No Pokémon, no TCG, just sports.\n\nI reached out to the seller and explained the situation, asking for a refund. This morning, I got the classic “refund rejected” message with zero explanation. Fortunately, I reported the issue to Whatnot directly with all the screenshots and video evidence, and they processed a refund quickly.\n\nMoral of the story: stay alert and double-check what you're buying. Just because someone seems legit doesn’t mean they are. I’ll be sticking to eBay from now on. Lol.\n\nIf you're curious, the seller goes by:\n\notiasports\n\notiarips\n\notiatcg",

    "text": "i got to my local gamestop 3 hours early and was 10th in line. They had 8 booster boxes, I asked the other 9 who was getting one and only 5 of them were so I was good to go. The people in line were awesome, at one point the target in the same plaza opened and we saw people going in and coming out with blooming waters boxes so we all took turns going over there and getting one. The target had DRI packs and 3 pack blisters, got some of those too and most of us ripped those packs on the gamestop sidewalk. There was a family with 4 kids and all the kids were so stoked to watch everyone else open their packs. One person brought sleeves and toploaders and someone pulled an SIR an they whipped them out of their bag to give to the person who hit. Hanging with a bunch of pokemon nerds helps kill the time, the dad of those kids has an insane collection he was showing off and one of the people in line vends at card shows.\n\n\n\nThe manager of the gamestop came out and told us she was actually off today but needed to make sure things went smoothly, she went down the line and asked each person what they were getting and gave us stickers for those products, so there would be no late cuts in line or anything like that. There was also an empty chair that was second in line that she said didnt count. too bad! after she distributed the stickers she went and enjoyed her day off.\n\n\nOnce the store opened everything was smooth and orderly. One of the 4 kids kept asking to see everyones promo so he could judge condition and centering lmao.\n\nI got home and my PC ETB and walmart DRI preorder had just been delivered. \n\nI generally hate whatnot, but Deep Pocket Monster did a stream yesterday with flash sales to get packs below MSRP plus if you used his referral code you got a $15 credit, so I got 6 packs for $24 with taxes and shipping. The stream was also really entertaining and he gave away a ton of shit. \n\n\nAll in all it just felt like yesterday was such an event, I had a lot of fun and havent even dug into my booster box yet. Yes things are insane around pokemon cards right now, but I just wanted to make rare positive post in this sub.",

    "text": "The world of sport has a huge range and impact on our lives, bringing entertainment that pushes the human body to the limits of its capabilities. Some people dedicate their whole lives to reaching the pinnacle of talent and make it to the top of their respective profession. These players can reach millions of people across the globe and create a massive following, which can impact on some of items that might have a connection to them. There are collectors of all kinds, but who has paid the most for highly treasured sports items?\n\n**#10 Muhammad Ali “Rumble in the Jungle” belt, $6.2 million**\n\nOne of boxing's most famous moments - Muhammed Ali and George Foreman square off in Zaire in 1974 to battle for the heavyweight title. Ali was considered the underdog, but his strategy of letting Foreman wear himself out early ended up in a win. NFL owner Jim Irsay bought the title belt in a 2022 Heritage Auction.\n\n**#9 Kobe Bryant 1996-1997 Lakers jersey, $7 million**\n\nHe wore this gold-colored jersey for the debut game, along with the preseason and other games during his rookie year. It was purchased by an anonymous bidder during a 2025 Sotheby's auction.\n\n**#8 1914 Babe Ruth rookie card, $7.2 million**\n\nOne of the most famous baseball players of all time, it's thought that only 10 of these cards exist and this latest one was purchased for $7.2 million at a Robert Edward Auction during 2023.\n\n**#7 Honus Wagner T-206 Baseball card, $7.25 million**\n\nThis is a fine example of a rare card, of which only 206 were made up to 1911 and only about 50 are thought to remain. It was purchased at a Goldin Auction in 2022 and is only the second sale of this type of Wagner card in about 20 years.\n\n**#6 Lionel Messi six 2022 World Cup match-worn shirts, $7.8 million**\n\nHe captained the team in the 2022 World Cup to their first win since 1986. He wore this set in the first halves of group play games. They were sold by Sotheby's in December 2023.\n\n**#5 The Olympic Games Manifesto, $8.8 million**\n\nThe original, hand-written and unique manuscript written by Pierre du Coubertin outlined his vision for the games. It was sold during a 2022 Sotheby's auction\n\n**#4 Diego Maradona “Hand of God” jersey, $9.3 million**\n\nHe wore this in the quarterfinals of the 1986 World Cup in the controversial game where, unseen by the referee, he scored a goal using his hand. It was sold during a 2022 auction at Sotheby's\n\n**#3 1998 Michael Jordan NBA Finals Chicago Bulls jersey, $10.1 million**\n\nOne of the greatest players in basketball, it is bound to draw a lot of attention even if it was only worn during a single game which ended in a loss. The 1997-98 season ended in a win for the Bulls overall. It was purchased in a Sotheby's auction during 2022.\n\n**#2 1952 Topps Mickey Mantle card, $12.6 million**\n\nA mint condition version of the card was sold for more than double the last recorded price. It is mentioned in passing in a lot of TV and other pop culture, adding to it's allure. It sold in August 2022 by Heritage Auctions.\n\n**#1 1932 Babe Ruth ‘Called Shot’ jersey, $24.1 million**\n\nAmazingly one of the oldest names in the world of baseball is far above the others, it is based around a killer hit that went 490 feet dead center and was probably the most famous point of his career. It was his last appearance at a Fall Classic and this game propelled the Yankees to victory. It was sold back in 2005 for $940,000 and this latest sale occurred in 2024.\n\nIf you're interested in placing the odd be then [Sportsbet.io](http://Sportsbet.io) has lots of well priced odds",

    "text": "So I had this interesting situation come up on TCGPlayer recently. I ordered 3 QCSR Emergency Teleport from a seller in April for around $11 each. The expected arrival date came without receiving them, so I messaged seller asking if they had a tracking number (as they should for an order above $30 IMO.) They said they didn’t but offered right off to send me 3 new copies if I still wanted them. I did, so I said that would be fine. Since they offered this right off, I suspected they forgot to send the cards—but whatever. \n\nA couple weeks later, still no cards and still no tracking so I opened a case with TCGPlayer before it got too far past the order date where I was able to do so. But I messaged the seller and told them that if the cards ended up still showing up, I would reverse the refund (because I try to be an honest guy). Seller doesn’t respond so I go ahead and just buy another Playset from someone else.\n\nNow today (9 days after I opened the case) the cards do arrive—but I see they weren’t post-marked until 2 days AFTER I messaged the seller telling them I would reverse the refund if the cards still arrived. So clearly they finally only sent the cards after I opened the case—so they could force a sale—after they failed to send the cards either of the previous two times they were supposed to. \n\nI obviously don’t need the cards anymore. I said I’d reverse the refund—but now I’m just extremely frustrated with how the seller handled this, both by never using a tracking number and by only sending the cards after I opened a case and didn’t need the cards anymore. \n\nWould you go ahead and reverse the refund? Would you send the cards back? Negative feedback? Neutral feedback? Some other option? I don’t want my own irritation keep me from being reasonable here.",

    "text": "I have always been super into organizing and watching prices of Magic Bulk ever since I started playing as a kid in 2012ish. I finally decided to take the plunge a few months ago and bought a bunch of bulk cards to start a store on TCGPlayer. The main hurdle is really sourcing the cards and figuring out your storage and organization processes. I initially tried my hand/failed at finding hidden gem lots on EBay (the site changed a lot since I was kid haha). It feels like newer sellers don't have an advantage when selling/sourcing higher value cards as game stores can source them at way better margins.\n\nI was honestly about to quit before I stumbled on u/Damiencbw's posts on here about selling lower priced cards in bulk. I had picked up around 18k cards at admittedly a bad rate (3-4 cents a card) and sorted out all the cards above 10 cents. As a by day accountant who reconciles everything, I organized everything by set if sellable and any cards I wanted to hold in Manabox. I have so far listed 4,744 cards in my TCGPlayer inventory and around 4,300 in Manabox. I initially listed some of my own pricier collection at low prices to get the initial sales to move up the TCGPlayer levels. You really need to get to level 3 (11 completed sales) and then you can list to your heart's content (50k max listings).\n\nI learned a lot about the shipping and pricing strategy during this first month or two. I'll link the video I think I found on Reddit about the packing method I mostly follow. Getting in the rhythm of packing and listing is super important to build up stock and reputation. Since I am newer, I had set my shipping to around $1.36 to get higher volume (I plan to increase later). I cannot emphasize enough that having a higher shipping rate + minimum card price is crucial. You never want any potential orders to have zero or negative profit.\n\nAn order packing guide I roughly follow - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2cybvXQ1Kw&t=287s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2cybvXQ1Kw&t=287s)\n\n  \nSome things I learned that I didn't find online. I hope these can help fellow newbies who search Google - \n\n1. Buy windowed envelopes in bulk, TCGPlayer's orders can be folded to show address to save sooo much time\n2. Buy a customized address stamp off of amazon (20 bucks) if you want to move a lot of orders\n3. I use the BCW Monster 5k's and their card dividers for storage/organization\n4. Local game stores and used video game stores are the better sources for decent bulk\n5. Track your revenue with cash basis accounting because you will need to file taxes\n6. I personally sort out draft chaff and stuff them in orders as freebies to free up space\n7. I pack orders with TopLoaders (3x4in) + Team Bags (3x5in) + Printed Order Slip\n8. Listing a bunch of cards/starting is initially not profitable so don't be discouraged\n9. Only start up if you love sorting and have the patience to list for hours on end\n\n",

How long have you been selling? Do you still enjoy it? How many paper cuts do you average a month? Do you have employees/sorting machines? How important are rares/art cards etc or is it all just playable commons and such \n\nIn my mental model, the average order value (assuming multiple cards) after shipping is like a dollar and assuming you sell through 5% of your inventory taking 50% for take home pay you’d need to have about 120k cards LISTED to take home 3k a month. \n\nIdk if that’s realistic or not, so I’m here to ask.",

    "text": "(Originally tried to post this in main sub, and auto mod flagged it due to \"opening\" in the title 😖 but it's very relevant here too)\n\nI am an English-speaking Magic player in the USA who happens to love and collect higher-end non-English foils, like Japanese, etc.\n\nI am *very much* in the minority of the playerbase here, and that's why I feel qualified to address an issue I've seen and the clear negative results for most.\n\nTarkir Dragonstorm solidified a pretty clear problem that needs to be addressed quickly - putting chase cards in English packs that can be found in English and Japanese languages, without the Japanese version having unique art (like Strixhaven), is a *major feel bad* for most players on several levels. \n\nAt one major store I spent a lot of time at during Prerelease and Release weekends, I personally opened or saw the following be opened:\n\n2x Japanese Halo foil Clarion Conqueror\n\nJapanese Showcase foil Ugin\n\nJapanese Showcase foil Elspeth\n\nJapanese Showcase foil Clarion Conqueror\n\nJapanese Showcase foil Craterhoof Behemoth\n\n\nIn most cases, players would be absolutely thrilled to open chase cards like this, but then the reality hits:\n\n1) They can't read the card. Using it in tournaments or competitive games is unnecessarily difficult. \n\n2) They look up the price, get excited for a moment, but then realize that the price showing on TCGPlayer is English - they then filter to Japanese, and discover that the Japanese price is in most cases less than 50% of the English version. Now they feel bad, or even robbed of their good pull -\n\nHere's the English vs. Japanese prices of the cards I listed above: \n\n2x Japanese Halo foil Clarion Conqueror $240 EN, $65 JP - 27% of EN \n\nJapanese Showcase foil Ugin $150 EN, $65 JP - 43% of EN \n\nJapanese Showcase foil Elspeth $85 EN, $43 JP - 50% of EN \n\nJapanese Showcase foil Clarion Conqueror $26 EN, $8(!) JP - 30% of EN \n\nJapanese Showcase foil Craterhoof Behemoth $40 EN, $20 JP - 50% of EN\n\n\n3) So, if they decide they don't want it, and try to sell or buylist the card... Well, because they're just language variants and not unique art... vendors, stores, and buylists mostly just don't want them except in specific circumstances - like the Japanese Halo foil Ugin, for example. \n\nSo now, the player is stuck with a (very beautiful) card, that they may not be able to read, that they face unnecessary difficulty in selling ( and I can tell you from selling on TCGPlayer that non-English cards by comparison move *extremely slowly* ) looking over at someone else who pulled an English version with growing frustration and resentment.\n\n\nI came across more than a few people with this exact same situation in the last couple of weeks, and I traded for some of their cards, because I collect them - but I'm not representative of a typical player.\n\n\nThe *typical player* is likely unhappy with a Japanese pull - and Wizards needs to fix that ASAP, in honestly one of two ways - by either 1) removing the Japanese cards from English packs, or 2) giving them unique art. Otherwise, it's an unnecessary frustration to customers that may well discourage them from opening more packs! ☹️",

Blatantly lying to the buyer that they “printed money” on overpaying on a base card (last sold for a $1.49 a few days ago on eBay) Not to mention one streamer was adding Wander Franco cards randomly to auctions for no reason. Do people enjoy Fanatics Live? Is there anything better than this? Is this a common experience?? ",
