However the max insurance that Beckett put on the package was $100.\n\nI’ve contacted Beckett via email multiple times with no reply and they don’t seem to have a phone number to contact them.\n\nDid Beckett cheat me out of the insurance I paid for on the submission and sent the card back to me with base level insurance?

    "text": "Not sure if I can send this complaint to Riot/Riftbound team directly but collecting cards in general is incredibly frustrating lately. Scalpers are the main issues but the secondary issue is when LGS BECOME the scalpers. There is no reason every single one of my 8 LGS in the area should be marked up to TCGPlayer prices.\n\nI have been collecting since 1996, Magic, Pokemon, Yugioh, Dragon Ball, Digimon the works. This day and age, collecting is looked at as a side hustle for a lot of people but LGS/LCS were always the last bastion of normalcy. Gonna throw a \"BACK IN MY DAY\" here, stores were disincentivized if they were caught marking up product past a certain point. Riftbound boxes being around $150/$170ish would be around that markup area. Neopets and WOTC used to straight ban stores from getting products, and still do to this day (Neopets) if distribution guidelines are not followed. I really suggest Riot take this route so Riftbound can be fun and affordable to enter more players hands at a local level.\n\nWell what about the scalpers you say? They will just buy out the LGS and relist on TCGPlayer. Do what Japan does.\n\n\n- Box limits per WEEK\n- Plastic cut on Booster Boxes\n- Some even go as far as cutting the top of packs on sale so they are no longer  sealed.\n\nScalpers hate all of this. What are you gonna do, list 36 packs whose seals are all broken? This game is awesome, I want it to thrive. I don't want it to become the frustrating circlejerk sphere that is Pokemon currently. If people cannot buy product affordably, they will leave.",

    "text": "Just wanted to share my journey on investing in number plates. back in 2021 I started buying heritage number plates as an investment. \n\nSharing the breakdown below of how it went:\n\nBatch 1 - bought 9 VIC plates directly from Vicroads for 12k each for $108k total. Sold all 9 for a total $304k. $196k profit, roughly 195% average return across the batch. Best one was 142.000 which returned 318%. There were some major catalysts, like Vicroads closing down their hertiage plate sales which meant the only source was the secondary market\n\n234.345 - bought for $30k, sold for $43k. Flipped in less than a month, 43% return. I bought this off the secondary market when vicroads plate sales were closed.\n\nNSW 3425 - bought for $149k, sold for $152k. Only made $3k on this one. Lesson learned about the NSW market being less liquid than VIC.\n\nBatch 2 - I'm currently holding 10 VIC plates bought for a total $198k. Estimating that ill be able to sell each plate for about 30k. i was able to buy these for 18k each just before Vicroads completely stopped selling hertiage number plates last year.\n\nTotal deployed: $507k \n\nRealised profit: $224k+ \n\nUnrealised upside: $131k\n\nI know people in the market who've done much higher returns trading lower 3/4/5 digit victorian heritage plates. My edge was i was early started this back in 2021 and i also built a script to scan through the available combinations on [vplates.com.au](http://vplates.com.au) and identify which plates were available. Only other way to do this was manually and VicRoads had over 285,000 heritage plates available for sale so there was a lot of data to work through.\n\nThe market is surprisingly liquid for the right combos and you can find a lot of past history through auction websites. it was a fun addition to my portfolio\n\nIs anyone else in here investing in number plates or other collectibles?",

So I started monitoring sales of his Prizm silver cards PSA 9 on eBay and I noticed a significant discrepancy in prices. All the cards in the screenshots are from sales today. Does anyone know why sales range as low has $189 to high as $292 despite all ending on the same day and all were auctions. Any clue? Are people trying to find the “best” cards and crack the for regrade? Thanks in advance for all replies. ",

Under the cards you’ll find the price the card was sold at, which does not include tax or shipping, as well as the sales date.  All sales are from eBay.  I also note whether the sale was sold at auction, at the listed price, or if a best offer was accepted.\n\nIn the interest of keeping variety, I’ve included no duplicate cards in the list, (otherwise the list would just be a bunch of FP-001 sold listings ranked by sale price, which might be an separate and interesting future assignment).  The only exceptions to this are FB01-139 and FB06-120, which both appear once as a BGS 10 Black Label and then once as a non-black label PSA/BGS 10.  I found this to be a good illustration of the difference between a black label and a regular 10 for the same graded card.\n\nAs always this is for informational purposes only.   If it’s not useful or interesting to you, feel free to move on.  **I’ve decided I may just start blocking folks who want to constantly rehash the “people like you are  ruining the hobby” argument, when all I’m doing is reporting objective price data.

    "text": "The trading card hobby continues to grow.\n\nMore people are collecting, trading, and enjoying cards than ever before, and grading has become an increasingly important part of how collections are protected, valued, and shared. That growth reflects a healthy, expanding hobby.\n\nIt has also increased submission volume across grading services, making turnaround times harder to estimate as demand continues to increase alongside grading capacity.\n\n**Changes to Card Grading Services**\n\nTo better align submission volume with grading capacity and support more predictable turnaround expectations, we’ve made updates to pricing across select service levels for new submissions.\n\nThese adjustments help align demand with grading capacity and support more consistent service across tiers. Updated pricing details are outlined below.\n\nAs part of these changes, TCG Bulk and Value Bulk have been consolidated into a single Collectors Club-only service. All Bulk submissions now use a single service level: Value Bulk, which accepts cards from all categories, including TCG.\n\nWe regularly monitor submission volume and grading capacity to ensure grading remains consistent and predictable across service levels. Consolidating Bulk services allows us to better align demand with capacity while providing Collectors Club members with a clear, consistent Bulk option.\n\n**Pricing Updates for New Submissions**\n\n* Value Bulk: $21.99 → $24.99\n* Value: $27.99 → $32.99\n* Value Plus: $44.99 → $49.99\n* Value Max: $59.99 → $64.99\n* Regular: $74.99 → $79.99\n\n**Estimated Turnaround Time Updates for New Submissions**\n\n* Value Plus: 40 → 45 business days\n* Value Max: 30 → 35 business days\n* Regular: 20 → 25 business days\n\n*Prices and Estimated Turnaround Times for Express and higher service levels remain unchanged.*\n\n**What This Means for Existing Submissions**\n\nThese updates apply only to new submissions as of Tuesday, February 10, 2026. Submissions that have already been created, are in transit to PSA, or are currently in our care, are not affected and will continue through the grading process as expected.\n\n**What This Means for Other Categories**\n\nThese updates apply only to cards. Dual Service pricing and Estimated Turnaround Times adjust proportionally based on the applicable grading service level.\n\nPrices and service levels remain unchanged for comic books, magazines, video games, tickets, packs, and other grading categories.\n\n**Our Approach to Capacity**\n\nOver the past several years, PSA has expanded grading capacity worldwide through continued investment in people, facilities, and technology. In 2021, PSA was grading approximately 15,000 cards per day globally. **Today, PSA grades approximately 90,000 cards per day globally** while maintaining consistent standards of accuracy and care. We remain committed to growing responsibly and deliberately with plans to significantly expand capacity at both existing and new facilities around the world in 2026.\n\nAs grading demand continues to grow and capacity expands, daily global throughput could reach hundreds of thousands of cards in the coming years. This is illustrative of the kind of scalable infrastructure we are building to support the long-term health of the hobby.\n\n**Looking Ahead**\n\nWe recognize adjusting pricing and services impacts collectors who submit cards regularly, and we appreciate your continued trust.\n\nPSA remains committed to supporting collectors and the long-term health of the hobby. These updates are one step toward ensuring grading remains reliable and predictable as the hobby continues to grow.",

Feels more “modern” and collector-oriented.\n\nPristine Marketplace / Pristine Auctions\nVery popular for signed memorabilia. Lots of daily auctions, especially for hats, jerseys, and photos.\n\nBeckett Marketplace\nGood if you’re already dealing with graded cards or Beckett-authenticated items.\n\nI know these Specialty Memorabilia Shops (Mostly Buying, Sometimes Consignment)\n\nSportsMemorabilia.com\n\nPro Am Sports (Canada)\n\nFrameworth (Canada)\n\nImperial Sports (Canada)\n\nMintink (cards & autos)\n\nEast Coast Sports Collectibles\n\nThese are great for buying with confidence, though prices can be higher than peer-to-peer marketplaces.\n\nWhich platforms do YOU trust the most for signed caps or memorabilia?

It took 4 days to get down to the last few teams. They had to serial one due to the price then it was down to just the Nationals. \n\nThe Nats were discounted several times over 6 hours and no bites. I offered 50 dollars for the laughs but they took it. 😂 The chat thanked me for “taking one for the team.” The break finally begins.\n\nThe first box he pulls a Randy Johnson First Inscriptions card and the chat is excited and the host seems to be mildly amused and moves on to box 2. The third card he pulls causes his face to look like he’s going to puke. Here’s the pulls from the 20 cards total 😆.\n\nWhich leads me to the question…..there’s not a ton of data that I can find. Should get the auto certified, get them graded, or go with raw? ",

The employee told me there still weren’t any — but then he mentioned the store is apparently closing in about a week and everything is getting transferred to another location. That honestly sounded like a worst-case scenario with my cards already stuck in limbo.\n\nSo I basically pleaded with him and said I’d just eat the \\~$220 submission cost if he could give me my cards back. I think he realized how messy/unreasonable the situation was because he actually gave me my cards back on the spot — but I didn’t get any refund.\n\nI’m relieved to have the cards back, but I’m still out the money. Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Any advice on how I should try to pursue a refund (corporate, district manage, etc.), or am I probably out of luck.

Ideally I’d only want to cross if it can stay AU55, but I’m also considering whether an AU53 outcome could still make sense.\n\nQuestions:\n\n* For Chinese silver (late Qing / provincial), how often do you see NGC AU55 cross to PCGS AU55?\n* Is crossover generally more conservative than cracking and submitting raw?\n* Any advice on minimum grade setting (AU55 vs AU53 vs ANY)?\n* If the coin can only cross at PCGS AU53, is that still a reasonable move in terms of market acceptance/value?\n* Does pedigree/provenance help at all with PCGS decisions, or is it purely surface/grade?\n\nThanks!",

Card was absolutly perfect and by their grading method ( which is practiclly similiar like Beckett's ) card gained maximum possible grade ( equivalent to beckett black label ) and it was graded in that condition 1/1, basiclly the most perfect card I ever had. On this link You can cheek card and see both sides of it https://www.aigrading.com/grading_certificate/B000113209 . \nBeckett returned to me card with multiple flaws on surface and they still gave me 10 for it ( 9.5 for centering and 3 other grades reached 10.0 ). As You can see card which they returned to me has on back nailprint, on left side and on right side discoliration. If it was only nailprint I could belive that it happened during grading, but I had OP cards with this sort of discoloration and that flaw is always printing/factory error and that cant occur during grading. I was texting them that I am willing to come in any place in world for public revise of my cards with other cards from same submission which got for surface 9 or 9.5 but they just keep ignoring me. I am pretty confident my card has been stolen, especially very soon after my grading in their pop report one more black label Teach occured. Any of You guys had similiar experience with Beckett EU?",

    "text": "Hi everyone. I’m posting this to document what happened to my collection and to ask for advice.\n\nIn 2023, I shipped a PSA submission through USPS. The package was never delivered and the tracking eventually stopped updating. I filed reports and tried to get help, but nothing ever moved forward.\n\nLater, I made a post in a Facebook group about the missing cards. A person reached out to me privately saying they had information about my cards. That same person showed me my LC Charizard already graded and listed for sale on their eBay. This was the first time I learned my cards were no longer just “lost.”\n\nI went back and forth with him and also contacted the USPS Inspector General. The Inspector General responded once and then stopped replying. The person who contacted me eventually took the card down from eBay and told me he would “keep it safe” and not sell it until USPS finished their investigation. Location is Indiana, same as me. \n\nAfter months of getting nowhere, I went to my local police department. They contacted the same person who had reached out to me and listed the card. He told the officer that he purchased the card from his boss, and that his boss works for USPS.\n\nAt this point, I honestly don’t know what to do. These were not just valuable cards, they were personal grails. I waited in line overnight in the cold and made the drive to Toronto to get them signed by Arita. They took years to acquire. The non autographed/sketched were also very clean as they were easier to find minty back then. So I don’t even know how to value my cards anymore. Any help would be appreciated. \n\nI’m sharing this for awareness and in case anyone has advice on next steps, or has dealt with something similar involving USPS, PSA submissions, or recovered stolen cards. Any guidance would be appreciated.",

    "text": "I have a huge card (valued in the $3,000-4,000 range raw), and I want to get it graded/slabbed by Beckett. Additionally, it's a card that I want graded quickly before a card show coming up here in a few weeks, and so I'm considering doing Beckett's Priority Service that they say takes up to 5 days. If it grades well (9.5, which I think it has a chance to after examining it), could easily turn into a $6,000-10,000 card. I usually grade with PSA, but wanted subgrades for a card like this.\n\n I have a few questions though and hoping to get help/opinions and or experiences from the community.\n\n* The card itself is a Topps Dynasty Patch Auto card. So it's thick. How would you advise shipping it to Beckett? I've heard some people say to go the **thick toploader + teambag route**, while others have stated that it's cool to send it in a **one-touch** as well. Would love to get everyone's opinion on how they would send it in.\n* Has anyone done the Priority Service for Beckett? Website says that it takes 5 business days for turnaround. Is this fairly true? Have you had good experiences with that service level? My hope is that I can get it back (from the time I ship to them to the time it gets back to me) in about 10-12 days.\n* Any other advice?\n\nThanks everyone in advance.

    "text": "Apologies in advance for the long post, but looking for any help or guidance here.\n\nI bought into a Chrome Update break on Fanatics Live on December 14th. One of the cards I hit was a Marcelo Mayer Radiating Rookies Superfractor Auto redemption card. As a lifelong Red Sox, obviously I was floored. Fast-forward to a week later, it never arrives. USPS tracking showed that it was \"pending delivery.\" I inquired at the post office, they weren't able to find it, so it's lost. I reached out to Fanatics Support via phone, was told that I'd have to reach out to Fanatics LIVE support, of which there is no phone or chat support, only email. I got a response back (spoiler alert, the ONLY response I've received throughout this issue) that I'd need to file a claim with USPS and then they'd be able to resolve pending the claim outcome. I did as instructed, USPS deemed it lost and unretrievable, and I forwarded as much to Fanatics Live. Complete radio silence onward. Not even a \"we're looking into this\" type message, just nothing, despite 3-4 separate tickets on the issue.\n\nMy thought is that since Fanatics is the manufacturer and distributor here, they should be able to verify that I'm entitled to the card, that the shipment is lost, that it hasn't been redeemed by me, and that they should be able to provide some alternative method of redemption, but this seems too tall a task. Fanatics boasts their \"Fanatics ONE\" account experience of a unified account across all their platforms, but their customer service couldn't be more disparate. I called into Fanatics (not Live) support this morning to see if they could maybe get in touch with Live to escalate or something and was told they have no connection whatsoever with Fanatics Live and wouldn't be able to help and was advised to just spam the email or complain on social media. Unbelievable that this is their recommendation. By nothing they are ensuring only two possible outcomes:\n\n1. A superfractor rookie autograph card never see the light of day\n2. The card is somehow redeemed by someone who has no right to it.\n\nAnyway, I guess the learning experience here is either don't break with Fanatics Live or be sure to insure big hits or get overnight shipping. I hadn't had any issue with fulfillment prior to this so it didn't occur to me at the time. \n\nAny guidance would be greatly appreciated.",

Filthbomb was given a similar allocation, so now we are at about 20% of the print run without factoring in a single other breaker that gets allocation from Fanatics. \n\nSingle boxes are so limited on the secondary market that they are going for 5x. There are a grand total of 23 available to purchase on eBay at the time I'm writing this. Call me a doomer - I don't really give a shit - but this is why you couldn't get Black & White or Bob Ross. And when you cant get those, and you don't want to pay 5x guess where you're gonna go - to the breakers. EQL or not, this is why these products are sold out in less than 5 minutes.

    "text": "Just received this from PSA Vault, first to clarify PSA Vault and PSA grading are run like two companies, here the focus is on PSA Vault, not grading.\n\nIt should be obvious by now, PSA Vault is in a total mess likely something went terribly wrong where they got hacked or scammed which caused all of the chaos in recent days. To summarize:\n\n1. Majority of PSA Vault seller payouts are paused since mid Jan, no real explanation given - this email I believe is one of the corrective action they are making to resolve whatever mess that happened internally.\n2. Buyers who purchased from PSA via ebay has their orders frozen, usually the order results in the slab in PSA Vault transferred to the buyer near instant closing out the transaction. Currently it is not transferred and stuck in payment complete phase.  Concerns are buyer may be able to file item not received after the ebay timeline (30 days I believe) for money back, and what happens then?   This issue is believed to be related to above\n3. Same linked ebay accounts are blocked from purchasing from ebay PSA seller (no bids, no buy now, no best offer), others had their login blocked altogether.  Again just happens suddenly, no explanation given to accounts in good standing without any issues.   PSA and PSA Vault completely refuse to address the issue, only directing the affected customers to message PSA seller via ebay message, but no response is ever received from ebay PSA seller.\n4. Ebay authentication to PSA vault purchase has a delay of 4+ weeks from authentication complete to be available in the PSA Vault ready for buyer's actions. This means it takes at least this much time after you made the purchase, not including shipping time, to be able to do anything with your slabs. And you need to track each during all this time, major pain for high volume buyers.  This is existing process NOT related to the new mess above, added here for completeness.\n\nThe worst from all of this is PSA's continued silence and obfuscation instead of just telling us what is going on. A market leader, rather a near monopoly, with the amount of money being made by this company, yet runs an operation like a basement outfit, so terribly. As someone on this forum puts it - launched the rocket while still building the engines.",

The overall total of the stack was $2,300, and I told him I'd do $2100 for a bulk deal. He grimaced and told me we were so close, and then asked if I could do $1500. \"That's my absolute best, I'm low key taking some stuff off your hands and I gotta carry em rest of the show, catalog and get new top loaders so I'm factoring labor into this.\" I wasn't overly offended, but I told him $2000 was the lowest. He got so mad and basically stormed off and the vendor behind me told that wasn't unusual for that guy and that he's got a name in our community for being a really opportunistic and derogatory whatnot streamer. is whatnot like that all the time? I've never really been on and never spent money on it, but have had a few people tell me \"oh yeah I'm a whatnot streamer, you might've heard of the stream.\" second reason is: is selling on whatnot worth it?

    "text": "Hi all,\n\nWanted to make a post of something I'm seeing - and a situation other prominent names in the sphere have called out.\n\nThere has been a marked increase in WWE Downtowns posted on eBay recently. This in itself isn't rare, but it is a cause for awareness. We know that there are some Downtown Reprints - [one seller on eBay actually labeled his that way](https://www.ebay.com/itm/187939072654?_skw=WWE+Downtown+Reprint&itmmeta=01KFXTF5MVH2ZKRT2KGTMH1NFC&hash=item2bc20aaa8e:g:N2AAAeSwx7Nowhg2&itmprp=enc%3AAQALAAAA8O7PUuNWmJ%2B%2BUShgI9tQz%2FqaXT3JKObBh6O%2BVK7%2BD0xtMzhEUqy0hnWpERH%2BSwQ0zsAyubvRzpvnhLq45t2WANGl0au4hFE%2Fa84%2FmEWvU%2BW8%2BUPvBXurZiykPqDIAOASSKFRnf9yh7MdpdFetqIphbcKttiKKYbyWNZivrt0bR4%2FYa56xdPUY87jpi4Q1WdmQlWTbIHj12YeZ%2B4MNkR52zt8BL2qWsOoDB5hsDFy5QcfMY5kFV%2FBz6d%2B5WXugv4J%2B1MiKGktkKhFegW4Yy7VF206stJtqURMES0rI3952KC4%2Bj%2BJVSvnfT2wf%2FfB%2BOFsmA%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABFBM2Nq8uv9m). A number of these reprints have sold at reprint prices on eBay and look fine at a distance.\n\nHowever, we're now seeing a high volume of Downtowns being pushed through consigners as well as other accounts. Four \"The Miz\" Downtowns are actively at auction with quickconsign - all of which are not in Panini One Touches or in graded slabs. Now this isn't a hard indicator of counterfeit...but the only real reason you see that is if someone removed the card from the OneTouch sent it in to grade, and cracked the slab. Right now, Quickconsign has 35 active auctions for WWE Downtowns overall - none graded or in Panini stickered One Touches. A seller consigning 35 Downtowns all in the same condition would be extremely odd. Full Court Press Collectibles also have a [number of these](https://www.ebay.com/str/fullcourtpresscollectibles?_trksid=p4429486.m3561.l161211) for sale\\* . Last week, THZSportscards (a very well respected WWE Card Seller) called out a substantial number of fake Kabooms at the Dallas Card Show, so those have been spread throughout the community too.\n\n\\* To be clear - I am not accusing these sellers of anything - they could have been given bad goods, especially if being consigned. If these are real...it's weird but I guess possible.\n\nI have no issue with \"reprints\" (fakes, counterfeits, etc.) - but a lot of these are seemingly being sold as authentic and some lower end names are below the authenticity guarantee, so in reality, as a buyer you're likely out of luck.\n\nSome high level thoughts - and if collectors who are in this area have more all thoughts are welcome\n\n* This is one of the best arguments for grading - I am not a grading snob, but much of the value of a slab is authenticity and these are one of the small number of modern cards that scammers and reprinters will target. A slab isn't a *guarantee* but it's a lot less likely someone trying to take your money and run will also fabricate a PSA slab at this level...though it can happen. *Personally* \\- I will only buy slabbed Kabooms or Downtowns if I am to do it as I don't trust myself to judge internet scans.\n* A level of awareness for Downtowns without the Panini One-Touch and sticker is probably fair. There are reasons for these to be re-holdered but you're likely getting something that had a bad grade or is fake if it's been removed.\n* eBay authenticity is a layer of help - reviews are mixed but ultimately at that price level you have the option to grade the card as part of the sale and they're reviewing it. Not sure how much I trust it overall, but I think the only way I'd buy a raw DT or Kaboom is if that's part of the deal (on eBay) as there is at least some level of accountability.\n* If you feel \"iffy\" about a specific purchase- there will be other opportunities. It may be more expensive. It may be a while. But these cards don't entirely disappear, you can wait until you feel okay. Also, feel free to ask people - the wrestling card community are largely good eggs and folks have a lot of experience, ask around before dropping real cash. The number of cards you don't see again are really low and Panini case hits generally float around.\n\nEdit; A good theory was brought up that these could be, to some extent. Backdoored copies that did not pass quality checks or were Panini overstock. A spike in slabbed volume recently or lower quality but legitimate cards would point to that. That is…a lot fuzzier in terms of collector approach for sure.",

    "text": "I’m an international collector.\nToday, I received an offer from PSA to sell one of my cards through PSA Vault, and I accepted the offer and completed the sale.\nAfter the sale, I was informed that I cannot receive the payment unless I have a Stripe account. As far as I understand, Stripe payouts are not available in my country.\nWhy is Stripe the only payout option? It feels outdated and extremely restrictive for international users. If I had known that Stripe was required, I would never have accepted the offer or sold the card in the first place.\nPSA says this is their policy, but allowing international sellers to complete transactions without a valid payout method makes no sense. This is a serious issue, especially for higher-value cards.\nHas anyone else experienced this problem with PSA Vault or PSA Marketplace as a non\\_toggle international seller? How was it resolved?",

I finally spoke to a human today but he was from the “online price guide” department and couldn’t transfer me to anyone. It’s been such a hassle to just pay for my submission. I can’t pay it online for some stupid reason. Most annoying experience ever. It took me like 9 days to get to a human and when I do, he essentially said “I can’t do anything”.

I made it clear that I wanted it sleeved and was going to grade it - they assured me that someone would put in top loader later before shipping.  Well it came in the mail sandwiched between two top loaders (not inside either) with tape holding them together.  One corner was visibly damaged.\n\nI reached out to them and to their credit they asked how they could make it right - which is where my dilemma is.

I have similar offers from both Fanatics Premier and Goldin Elite, so the payout numbers alone don’t make the choice for me.\n\nI’m trying to figure out which platform might give me the best overall result in terms of:\n\n🔹 Sell-through & timing — Does one move high-end cards faster?\n\n🔹 Audience & exposure — I know Goldin can have strong engagement for big cards, but Fanatics is huge too. Curious how they compare in reality. Who brings more serious buyers for rare soccer cards?\n\n🔹 Experience & reliability — Communication, transparency, and overall consignment experience.\n\n🔹 Marketing/promotional guarantees — Placement in auctions, highlighted lots, etc.\n\nIf you’ve sold big soccer cards (especially high end Messi cards) on either of these platforms, I’d love to hear your experience and what you’d recommend.\n\nThanks in advance!",

    "text": "I used to collect as a kid but as of last week I’m back in the hobby. Unfortunately, my reintroduction was through breakers on fanatics as I was unaware of how problematic breaking was (please don’t yell at me! I am now aware of how bad breaking is for the hobby and will not be breaking with card breakers going forward). Anyway, I got a decent hit off a case break. I got the card yesterday and it has damaged in the corner. I didn’t notice any damage on the live stream, nor did the streamer indicate that the cards in the case were damaged in any way. There was no damage to the shipping from what I could tell. The damage is to one corner of the card, and my guess would be that it was damaged while the breaker was loading the card based on how the corner looks.\n\nAnyway I messaged the shop that I purchased the spot in the case break through about the damage. They asked what they could do to make this right and I said send a comp card or refund my purchase entirely. They instead replied by saying they can send me an empty card package for the particular case and I can send it back to Topps. They said that they receive cards that are already dinged up, which I can understand. However, I don’t want to risk submitting a claim with topps for a damaged card because if they deny my claim I will be screwed, especially because I have 30 days from date of purchase to raise any issues with an order on fanatics live.\n\nAnyway, just looking for some advice from those that have dealt with receiving damaged cards from a break on fanatics live",

    "text": "So, before I start on this, I want to say ive been watching this guy for maybe 8 months now and I really am proud of how far he has come and what he is doing now. At first, I didnt know what to make of all the drama, the trolls, the lore.. I now am a loyal member of the kingdom and if you this post 10minutes you may be too.\n\nBefore he was known as **King Jonas**, he was simply **Jcardcollector96**, a 29-year-old from Beverly Hills, CA who entered the sports card hobby in 2018 with passion, money, warmth, and an unguarded heart.\n\nHis rise on Whatnot Sports intertwined with a woman many in the hobby came to know as Gianna — **\"HobbyPrincess\"**. They were not merely collaborators on stream; they were lovers, partners beyond the screen—an unlikely pair who shared late calls, Las Vegas vacations, grand dreams, and a spark that collectors still whisper about. Their bond was intense and lasted 3 months, but when it fractured, the hobby itself took notice.\n\nIn the aftermath of their break-up, rumors swelled like storm clouds. Across Whatnot, Reddit, Instagram, Medium, TikTok and Facebook, strangers spun tales—some dramatic, some delusional, many untrue. Narratives were twisted, intentions distorted and lies took flight faster than facts could walk. Yet Jonas chose not to drown in that noise. He chose creation. He chose rebirth. He chose the Kingdom...\n\nTo stumble upon **King Jonas’** hall on Whatnot is not a mere scroll-by—it is to cross the threshold into a Kingdom reborn.\n\n\n\n[Shows · jcardcollector96 · JCardCollector96 LLC · Whatnot: Shop, Sell, Connect](https://www.whatnot.com/user/jcardcollector96/shows)\n\n\n\nWhere once there was only heartbreak and exile, now rises a sovereign court adorned with **$100,000s in prized inventory**, a growing legion of **loyal Knights**, and nightly Royal Decrees (“givveaways”) that send the chat into roars of triumph.\n\nThe sports breaks & packs that are ripped become battles; the slabs and big hits are grails, spoils of war; and the marketplace itself, a proving ground where the King now commands a massive following, **20,000+ followers** and he defends his Kingdom against rival realms.\n\nBut the true power of the Kingdom is not only in its treasure vaults or its victories—it is in the culture forged in the chat. Seasoned Knights and curious travelers alike find a welcome at court. The tone is warm, the camaraderie lively, and the banter forged not for exclusion but for fellowship. In a world where many streams feel cold, transactional, and uninspired, the Kingdom stands as a rare stronghold of connection, energy, and authentic passion for the hobby.\n\nEach show unfolds like a chapter in an ever-evolving saga. Cards are revealed with suspense, oddities emerge from sealed relics, and surprises drop like sudden proclamations from the throne. No loyal Knight knows what decree, duel, or treasure will come next, and that very unpredictability makes the Kingdom’s battles worth witnessing in real time.\n\nTo visit **King Jonas’** domain is to witness a streamer who did not merely survive the trials of heartbreak... he turned personal pain & drama into lore. And it is precisely that blend of **storytelling, scale, sales skills, and spirit** that keeps collectors returning night after night, not only to collect—but to belong... to the Kingdom!!\n\n🏰THE KINGDOM IS FOREVER🛡️",

They just sit—$10–$200 pieces nobody wants.  \nTying up money and going nowhere.\n\nNow I’m shifting to trades to move faster.  \nBundling the small stuff into packages to target bigger singles (like a Cade Flawless HPA).  \nGives me room for negotiation and lowers risk in this down market.\n\nIt’s a brutal moment for all card investors.

    "text": "Been lurking on this sub for a while and always see people asking how to value their collections. Last month I inherited a shoebox full of my dad's old baseball cards from the 80s and 90s – we're talking hundreds of cards with no idea what's junk and what's gold.\n\nI spent hours manually searching eBay sold listings before giving up. Tried a couple apps but the recognition was hit or miss. Then a buddy at my LCS mentioned SnapCard and honestly it's been a game changer for organizing everything.\n\n**What I actually like about it:**\n\n* **The sports card scanner is stupid fast** – just snap a photo of any baseball card, basketball card, or football card and it identifies it almost instantly. Saved me so much time going through that shoebox.\n* **Real-time price guide pulls from actual sold data** – not just random asking prices. It aggregates from eBay, Goldin, Heritage Auctions, and PWCC so you're seeing what cards actually sell for.\n* **The PSA grading estimates are surprisingly accurate** – I was skeptical about the AI grading analysis, but I sent in 5 cards to PSA and the app predicted 4 of them exactly right (missed one by half a grade). Also does Beckett grading and SGC grading estimates if that's your preference.\n* **Collection manager actually works** – I can finally track my card collection value over time instead of random spreadsheets.\n\n**Cards it supports:**\n\nWorks with pretty much everything I've thrown at it – baseball cards, basketball cards, football cards, hockey cards, even my kid's Pokemon cards and some MTG cards I had lying around. Basically covers sports cards and trading card games.\n\n**Not perfect though:**\n\n* Vintage cards pre-1970 can be spotty on recognition\n* Wish there was a web version for bulk scanning\n* Some of the market trends data could be more detailed\n\n**Who it's good for:**\n\nIf you're a casual collector with a pile of cards you need to sort through, or you want to know if something's worth submitting for grading before paying $30+ per card, it's solid. The card grading analysis alone has probably saved me from wasting money on submissions that wouldn't grade well.\n\nThey claim 50K+ collectors and 99% accuracy – I can't verify those numbers but my experience has been good.\n\nAnyone else using it? Curious what your results have been with the grading estimates.\n\nHere's the link if anyone wants to check it out: [trysnapcard.com](http://trysnapcard.com) or you can grab it directly from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/snapcard-sports-card-scanner/id6757433755)\n\n*Not affiliated, just a collector who got tired of manual lookups. Happy to answer questions if anyone's on the fence.*",

    "text": "I’ve always thought about this, but this is the first time I’ve seen something this explicit. I have no way to confirm this is what happened or was carried out, but let me set up/propose the following scenario.\n\nYou have 2 or more moderately valued cards in the PSA Vault. You take 1 copy and set it as “buy it now” through PSA on EBay for 3-4x the real value. You then proceed to buy your own card. You initially lose the 13% for selling fees. However, Card Ladder, which the large majority of the time, uses the last sale to calculate the value, now reflects this monster sale. The Card Ladder value is what PSA uses to calculate preferred partner offers. From what I have seen, that last sale/Card Ladder value makes its way to the PSA calculated offer in a fairly reasonable time. Additional sales may trickle in, but there’s usually at least a transient period of time where the offer is calculated based on that one, high sale. \n\nCase example: CZ Mewtwo Vstar sold through PSA Vault on eBay for $1499 yesterday.\n\nMath: Card sold to yourself for $1500. You receive $1305 payout after fees (Net -$195). PSA Partner offer for your other copy in the vault becomes ~$1075 (70-75% of the $1500 Card Ladder value). After accepting, you net $880, roughly 2.4x the real value of the card.\n\nObviously there’s a lot of uncertainties with this thought, but after coming across the attached sale yesterday, it made me question if someone actually attempted to execute this plan that has definitely crossed my mind lol.",

    "text": "This is a brief tutorial on how to find PSA 10 candidates on eBay. Obviously this is a bit tricky, as there’s only so much you can see from photos. Here are some best practices:\n\n# 1. Focus On Centering and Corners\n\nSurface issues generally require the right lighting and angles to see. Edge issues generally require specific angles. Since centering and corners are the only things you can see well from pictures, we try to make sure everything we buy at least has good centering and sharp corners.\n\n# 2. Get the Right Pictures\n\nWe will always ask for pictures of the card outside of both the top loader / mag and any penny sleeves. This helps us to see the surface as best we can. We try to avoid buying cards without these pictures.\n\n# 3. Ask Questions\n\nI’ll caution you to ask smart questions. Don’t ask a seller “do you think this is a 10?” But do ask about specific defects you’re unsure of, whether the seller pulled the card himself, or whatever else is relevant.\n\n# 4. Read the Descriptions\n\nThe description sometimes will give you important context. Is the card pack fresh? Is there some issue you should know about? Always read descriptions before buying.\n\n# 5. Know Your Seller\n\nIt’s impossible to do this perfectly, but we try to avoid buying from anyone who grades. The reason is that if someone is an experienced card grader, there’s a good chance *they are only selling ungraded cards that are* *unlikely to 10.*\n\nSellers with high number PSA certifications on their profile likely have graded recently. For example, if a seller has the following certs...\n\n**13000000**\n\n**13000001**\n\n**13000002**\n\n**13000003**\n\n**13000004**\n\n... then it’s probably best to assume the raw cards they’re selling won’t gem.\n\nSide note: we also try to avoid cards pulled from repacks, as we’ve found these often have small defects.\n\n# 6. Be Aware of Gem Rates\n\nRemember: **Gem Rate** **= PSA 10 Population / Total Graded Population.**\n\nHere is an example of gem rate data for the 2024 Drake Maye Silver Prizm #329, from the PSA app.\n\nYou can also find this on **gemrate.com**.\n\nUnderstand that if a card has a 20% gem rate, that means well centered copies without obvious defects are getting 10s about 20% of the time. *Do not buy low gem rate cards and* *expect* *sure-fire 10s.*\n\n# 7. Use Expected Value Math\n\nIf you’re buying to make a profit, use math and expected value to determine if you’re buying at a good price.\n\nYou can find a guide on finding the Expected Value of a card [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/psagrading/comments/1px6tfb/looking_at_the_most_profitable_card_graders_can/)**.**\n\n# 8. Expect To Fail Sometimes\n\nMost cards have at least minor issues that you can’t see in an eBay listing, which means it’s important to have a strict pre-grading process after the cards are delivered. You can find a guide on how to evaluate PSA 10 candidates [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/psagrading/comments/1pvhste/the_complete_guide_to_psa_grading_and_profitable/).\n\n**About 15% of the cards we buy are not PSA 10 candidates.** We generally resell these cards raw at a small loss, but *we do not waste money grading cards that will not 10.* As long as you are making good money when you get 10s, you can afford to take these losses.\n\n**You DO NOT need to be perfect to be profitable.**",

I hit the Dallas Mavericks in an auction and hit some valuable Cooper Flagg rookie cards, one was a yellow foil numbered to /275 that is worth at least $800 raw, if graded even more. I also hit a ball of duty Cooper Flag Rookie wave holo that is worth at least $100 raw. After the break the seller cancelled my order saying he lost them smh. I reached out to whatnott and the seller and still I haven’t got any type of refund or compensation for the cards. I sent a bunch of emails to whatnot support and they still say they are investigating. I sent them all the evidence they asked for and it’s going on 5 days already and still nothing. Now my money and cards that I hit are in limbo. Everyone please be careful on whatnot and always look at the sellers reviews before buying from them. This seller kept the best team which is the Dallas Mavericks which was supposed to be mine but he canceled my orders for himself to keep my valuable Cooper Flag Rookies and he charged everyone else for the rest of the 29 nba teams. The seller made out on my Copper Flag rookie cards and made the people pay for the rest of the teams in the break. The picture in the video is of the seller. \n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/1q4wyoy/video/2pukc55ralbg1/player\n\n",

    "text": "A few days ago I came to know that one of my friends from engineering, was diagnosed with HIV.\n\nLet's call him \"**the unluckiest guy ever**\". \n\nI met him in 2013 in my college first year. He is from Bihar originally, but lives in Noida from his childhood.\n\nIn all my time of knowing him, he was always shy quiet type guy. Introvert type, never smoked, never drank, did not even eat meat, full vegetarian. We tried to drag him to the '**theka**' near our hostel numerous times but that MF wouldn't budge. \n\nNone of us had any girlfriends in college but he even looked like he doesn't have one. (For Civil and Mech Engineering it is a given)\n\nAfter college I moved near his home in Noida with 3 other friends from college, for work and we would hang out most weekends. (And play PUBG).\n\nSuffice to say, He never had any female interaction at all. Poor fucker. Now we were all working and had some money so visited THOSE kind of ladies too, but again this guy declined. Morals, he said. We all laughed, teasing him. \n\n\"Abey gay toh nahi h na tu?\" \n\n\"Aaja tuhje ladka dila denge\"\n\n\"Khada nahi hota kya\"\n\n**We were dumb idiots. I feel so dumb right now.**\n\nBut yes, he never went with us on our \"adventures\". Remained a virgin BC.\n\nThe only time I saw him get into some trouble was when he took a loan from a guy in hostel, about 15k and \"invested\" it somewhere and lost all of it and couldn't pay the guy back. I don't remember if he did or not, at all. \n\n**What I'm trying to tell is he is a VERY SIMPLE guy.** \n\n**Anyways**, cut to 2 years back, his family started looking for a girl for him, you know... arranged marriage. And after some search they selected someone from Delhi itself from his own caste and all.\n\nThey started talking and I guess liked each other. But I'm not sure how those talk went really because my man had no game really.\n\nWhen we asked \"**kya baatien karta h bhabhi se hume bhi dikha...?\"** He just got shy like a girl every-time.\n\nShe worked in some IT call centre in Delhi. They both liked each other and **a date** was set. And when that date came, the wedding was postponed because the girl got sick. Both families talked and set another date. And then it was postponed once again. **Wtf**.\n\nThen on a **third date**, they finally got married. Both seemed happy. Now this guy is 32 years old and his family is old school, so of-course they want a grandchild the very first night. \n\nI guess after sometime they really started 'trying'. Meanwhile he also completed the \"visit Goa\" achievement that every engineer dreams of. But with his wife.\n\nCut to 4-5 months after his wedding, he started having health difficulties himself. I never saw him catch a cold and now he would not stop coughing BC. In our weekend meets we joked \"**TB ho gaya kya l\\*de?**\"\n\nHe went for a check up one time, doc prescribed some basic medicines, no change. \n\nHe went back a second time, with even more brutal cold and cough, fever and whatnot, got tested properly this time and **BAM! He has HIV.** \n\nHe panicked as he didn't want his wife to have the same, took his wife to doc, she ALSO got it. \n\nFamily got the news, we all 4 got the news. \n\n**We were all thinking the same thing, he must have gotten it from the girl. There is no other way.** \n\nHis cousin is a thug type guy, researched a bit from his \"sources\" about the girl. Apparently, she was a passed around quite a bit (used to even live separate with her girlfriends, away from family, for her job, despite having her home in Delhi). This cousin told my friend's father. He called the girl's father to take her back. He obliged. My friend's father threatened with a case too. And then they threatened with a dowry case (**they gave a swift in \"dowry\"**).\n\n**And that's where we are right now.**\n\nHis father has taken him to Mumbai for treatment. They know someone there. His father had cancer treatment there, a few years ago. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**I used to think I'm unlucky but never have I ever seen a more unlucky guy.** \n\nI'm lowkey now scared myself that now I got it from him BC. I was sitting right fucking there when he was coughing. Fuck. But I'm scared to even go for a checkup. I've seen those commercials that it doesn't transfer from handshake and all but I don't believe that's true. It must have some effect. \n\n**I think his parents really really really failed him that they did not research enough about the girl. They fucked his whole life up.** \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**TLDR-**\n\n**My friend, introvert, shy type guy, arranged marriage, got married to a girl with a severe past, got HIV from her and now is being threatened with a dowry case.** \n\nI've known him from past 13-14 years. I don't know what else to say. Stay safe bhai, and use protection everywhere I guess. \n\nIt is hard enough to ask a lady about her past in arranged marriage, I don't know how can a person even start to ask about an STD check before marriage. It simply cannot be done. The lady will simply break off the 'rishta' and feel disrespected. \n\n**Thank you for reading.

I started collecting about 5 months ago and quickly fell in love with the hobby and ripping packs, learning the market, and sharing it with family has been an awesome experience. I’ve been an NFL fan my whole life (proud eagles fan 🦅) and i played cornerback for several years, so i am very passionate about sports especially football. Football cards are my main focus, but I also enjoy baseball, basketball, and soccer including the collegiate version of football and basketball. I’m finishing high school in a few months and would love to start building a small sports cards business or side hustle, i think it would be a great opportunity to learn how the industry works and gain experience and knowledge. I am very hard working, fast learning and a great negotiator and i think most importantly, i am passionate. Any help would mean a lot to me so feel free to contact me about anything. I’d also really appreciate advice on:\n\n• How you got started selling or trading\n\n•\tBest platforms for Canadians (eBay, Whatnot, shows, etc.)\n\n•\tShipping/packing efficiently and safely\n\n\t\n\n•\tAny common beginner mistakes to avoid\n\nI’m not sitting on a huge collection or big money, i am just trying to learn, work hard, and do things the right way. Any insight or experiences you’re willing to share would mean a lot. I know its not going to be easy and i am ready for it. I have a good sized collection with big hits and good pulls and everything is scanned and organized. If anyone wants to check it out i will be more than happy to show you. Thanks for taking the time to read, i really appreciate this community and i am looking forward to giving you guys updates on how it is going:) Contact me if you guys have any questions and have a great day!",

When I leave for the post office I mark the PWEs as shipped. \n\nThe day after I marked this order as shipped, I receive a message from the customer asking if I shipped and what the tracking number was. I informed them that I shipped the order yesterday and that I sent it PWE. They tell me that their mailman is a thief and if it doesn't have tracking they won't get the order. I tell them if they don't get the order by the estimated delivery time, we'll figure something out(I'd make them wait a couple more days and then refund them\"). \n\nToday they messaged me with a refund request saying that they don't trust that they'll receive their order since it doesn't have tracking and that they want a refund. It's only been 4 days since the order was shipped and today is a holiday. Do y'all think I should just refund them and take the loss or tell them to wait until the estimated delivery day? \n\nI know this is a part of the online seller game and I'm not too distraught about the money cause I'm really only $7 into this card, but I'd like some other opinions on the situation\n\nEDIT: I should have said I'm a seller with ~5k sale and I've sent hundreds of orders this size, this way. People almost always get their order and this is the first time someone has overtly tried to scam me like this. I'm going to make them wait and then escalate to TCGplayer before I refund.\n\nFor the people who are saying I should track everything that's over $20, this business would not be sustainable and no one would sell a large volume of cards on TCGplayer if this was enforced. \n\nThanks for the input everyone!",

Recently, however, it seems that the PSA Store on eBay has a 60-minute auto-pay enabled.\n\nAuto-pay itself is fine, but I need all of the cards I purchase to remain in the PSA Vault. The issue is that auto-pay defaults to shipping the cards to my home. Most of the time I catch it in time and change the option, but sometimes I’m busy in the evening and miss the window before auto-pay triggers, preventing me from selecting the vault option.\n\nDoes anyone know how to turn off the 60-minute auto-pay? Or have the default shipping option go to my vault? I’ve gone through all of my eBay settings and can’t find anything related to this.\n\nI’ve also messaged PSA through eBay and contacted eBay support, but so far I’ve only received generic responses with no clear answer.\n\nThanks!",

    "text": "I was wondering how everyone did this year in the world of cardboard. What were your best purchases/strategies that panned out in 2025? What were some bad choices/failures/scams that ultimately wasted your time or lost some money? I have my wrap up below as more of a newbie in the space, but I am super interested in hearing people's stories. \n\n\n\nWins:\n\nI started in May of this year and have 25k cards listed in TCGPlayer. I bought 134k cards this year but have sorted all of them (still have 14k cards to list). I am now able to process cards quicker and have a wonderfully large garage shelf for storage.\n\nI bought a couple collections off of Facebook that really panned out. Some highlights include a $500 lot that turned into $5,000 and a $250 one that became $1,300. I picked up a bunch of Warhammer UB bulk for cheap which skyrocketed obviously.\n\nI hit 2,500 orders on TCGPlayer and 10.5k in sales this year. Hitting the max level and gold star seller really helped out on this front. I am around 12-15 orders a day now which is great for me (still small fry numbers). A chunk of these sales were not optimal though which is more so mentioned in the losses column.\n\nI got to meet a bunch of nice local MTG fans via deals and heard a lot about people's stories and strategies. It might not be the case for introverts but I love talking to customers or suppliers about anything cardboard.\n\n\n\nLosses: \n\nI was new to buying bulk and bought a bunch of crap off of eBay for little to no return. I bought cards at way above rate and had to work hard just to not lose money which wasted time. A lowlight included spending $150 on 5k cards which were obviously picked through. It taught me a lot about sourcing though and thankfully wasn't a big deal. \n\nBuying non windowed envelopes and spending hours handwriting addresses 500 times. Learned a lot about packing orders more efficiently from this haha.\n\nSome silly USPS issues that were partially my fault (losing around a 100-200 bucks). A highlight was getting a USPS damage claim rejected because I filed it wrong. In my defense, those forms are not easy and error out too much (curse you file size maxes!). I learned to give buyers the benefit of the doubt but to always be a bit suspicious of bad apples.\n\nA big one for me was not sorting great at the start so I had to go through a redo a bunch of my boxes. It is super important to have a good idea of what you want the end result to be before you start on big projects.\n\n\n\nOpportunities:\n\nIn 2026, my goal is to hit a ton of tag sales in the spring to see what I can find. I know it won't make me millions but I am excited to dumpster dive for the white whale lots. \n\nAfter I get through these final 14k cards, I plan on spreading a bunch of local ads about my willingness to buy collections. Hopefully people can starting coming to me with offers sometimes instead of me endlessly scrolling FB marketplace.\n\nI will continue to refine my bulk strategy and hopefully improve my margins further this next year.\n\n\n\nResults:\n\n2,574 sales (and counting) with only 8 full refunds\n\n99.9% rating overall (one salty eBay review, 2,573 without issues)\n\n10.6k in revenue \n\n2.8k in profit\n\n650 bucks in cash flow (should be much higher next year without startup costs)",

    "text": "Been seeing a lot of arguments regarding TAG vs PSA and it always comes around to AI, and how TAG is better because it uses AI. Then come the comments about how it’s not AI, and how garbage it is. Then come the comments about how people sent in PSA 8’s and got PSA 10’s. The list goes on and on. Well here’s my take. \n\nTAG: \n\nPROS- Unique. Machine learning may be the future of grading and they have built an esthetically pleasing slab, and concept in regard to the 1000 point scale. They want to provide collectors with a new way to collect and they are actively gathering reviews, listen, and working hard to make it better. Turnaround times are short. You pay based on the raw value of the card, and not the post grade value. They value transparency. \n\nCONS- Everyone thinks TAG is special because of their “MACHINE LEARNING.” It is NOT artificial intelligence, it is building a massive database of what a 10 is and a what a 9 is. That changes, with every single card scanned. By definition, it isn’t consistent when looking at it over a long period of time. Their slabs are cheap, and break with mild thumb pressure to the center of the slab. They have no vaulting service, and lack the ecosystem to properly track values. Grading is expensive for lower value cards. \n\n\nPSA:\n\nPROS- Amazing resell value and massive share of the industry, they ARE and likely will remain the industry standard, regardless of all the haters. Even despite the massive issues regarding the 9s being re-graded into 10s after the customer already accepted the grade 9 payout offers, PSA prices held and there was no noticeable reduction in values. The slabs are durable, yet light. Vaulting service allows seamless selling direct to PSA, or direct to EBAY. Selling from the vault means the buyer on eBay doesn’t pay taxes or shipping (if they send to their vault) and in my experience, this means a better sale price. Better payout percentages through eBay for higher value cards. Grading costs are still reasonable, especially for bulk. PSA acquire Genamint in 2021, meaning they do use some form of scanning automation, and possibly ML/AI for card grading. \n\nCONS- The entire grading industry is changing, and PSA has clearly been flaunting their checkbook. The recent talks of acquiring Beckett, buying out a massive share of the graded card market, the MASSIVE partnership with GameStop and starting a gambling service, and no one knows where all of this is headed. There are still massive inconsistency’s in PSA grading standards. Users have sent in PSA 8’s and gotten PSA 10’s. Wait times are excessive (95 days for bulk). Customer service is dog. No transparency as to why a card received a grade, and no transparency to the actual grading process and their proprietary technology.  \n\n\nI am 100% confident I missed a ton of Pros and Cons for each, and we will let the comments section clean it up. I am definitely biased towards PSA, as you can probably tell. 90% of my cards are in the PSA vault and I love it. I definitely have concerns about the conflicts of interest with them offering to buy the cards directly after grading, and their up-charge system based on grades.  I recently did a TAG submission and a couple of the cards had completely shattered slabs when I received them, and the box wasn’t even damaged. I am more than willing to wait 95 days to know that my cards are going to stand the test of time, and not arrive at my front door damaged. Some cards that deserve a 10 will get an 8, or a 9, and I can accept that. For the most part, PSA is pretty darn consistent and I maintain a pretty good GEM rate on Pokemon and One Piece. PSA is definitely using automated scanning tools to encourage consistency, not as heavily as TAG, but they are nonetheless. \n\nI hope my take here is valued, and I look forward to seeing what my fellow collectors have to say!! Thank you 🙏 ",

You post a thread of what you have, what you want, and usually trades are of equal value with one person putting some money in to cover the difference if it doesn't come even. You would mail with toploaders and whoever had the lower rep on the site would send first.\n\n\nFrom what I hear though, Pojo is sort of ancient history and 'everyone gets their cards from TCGPlayer now'. I have a lot of value in my collection but am trying to minimize money spent. I have about 15-20 cards to obtain within the next two months. \n\n\nThe goat discord for trading doesn't seem to see enough trading traffic. Pojo seems like not the place anymore. Card shops tend to give like ~60% value to buy cards which is pretty rough. And becoming a seller on TCGPlayer seems pretty rough.\n\n\nSo I'm curious, are there any avenues for trading out there? How do you all obtain your cards now? What do you do with cards you don't need that hold value that you want to exchange?",

Just curious to see what you guys think! \n\n  \nLink to item, if you wanna check it out yourself:\n\n[https://www.ebay.com/itm/297716515024?epid=25071592164&itmmeta=01KC4DRHFZWS7234Q9XKFMKAS9&hash=item45514980d0:g:2\\~AAAeSwM2Bo1HFp](https://www.ebay.com/itm/297716515024?epid=25071592164&itmmeta=01KC4DRHFZWS7234Q9XKFMKAS9&hash=item45514980d0:g:2~AAAeSwM2Bo1HFp)\n\n",

Put the card and a Dad Man's Dugout sticker in a team bag.\n\n2. Secure the card between 2 pieces of cardboard for extra stability.\n\n3. Wrap it all with a rubber band to hold everything in place.\n\n4. Include my handwritten thank-you note: I thank the customer for their purchase, ask them to follow my eBay store, Whatnot account, and social media. I also provide 1 or 2 fun facts about the player and ask for their feedback.\n\n5. Place it in a bubble mailer, then nest that inside another bubble mailer for double protection.\n\n6. Add a \"Fragile: Handle with Care\" sticker on the outside.\n\nFor cards valued under $20, I keep it simpler with a team bag, folded paper case, and painter's tape inside a thank-you card (check my other video for details!). \n\nI'll upload more videos soon!

I’m trying to turn this into a small side hobby/profit, but I’m not totally sure how to go about selling my lower-value cards or when it actually makes sense to get cards graded.\nRight now most of my cheaper cards are in the $1–$10 range, and I have a few around $20–$30 raw. A couple of my better ones have high PSA 10 comps, but the raw versions aren’t super valuable, so I’m unsure if grading is worth it.\nI’d really appreciate any advice on:\n• What’s the best way to sell low-end cards?\n(Ex: Should I make lots? Use Whatnot? Facebook groups? Cheap eBay auctions?)\n• How do you know if a card is worth grading?\n(Especially when the PSA 10 price is high but the raw card has a tiny flaw like whitening.)\n• Any general beginner tips for flipping or selling on the side?\nThanks in advance for any help — I’m still learning and don’t want to waste money sending the wrong stuff in or listing things the wrong way. Any suggestions or resources are appreciated! 🙏",

I’m not a moron, I have lighting and a jeweler loupe. These companies want you to believe they have professional, qualified graders who will give you the grade your item deserves. This is a multimillion dollar industry, so they really need to get it right. \n\nImagine my disgust when the cards I expected to grade high came back as 4s or 5s.\n\nFor two years I’ve been seething, thinking about how they take peoples’ money and fuck them over. Now I’m questioning my reality- am I an idiot? Did I miss significant damage somewhere? Now I have to crack the slab open and pay more to grade elsewhere?\n\nWell I sent one in to Beckett to see. And lo and behold, my PSA 4 came back a Beckett 9. With two sub grades as 9.5.\n\nPSA are scumbags and they should refund money. This card has now increased in value 6-fold. Now I have to crack the others and pay out more money for an appropriate grade. There will definitely be a class action lawsuit in the future, because there is no way this is an isolated incident.

The entire collection of comics were hand-delivered to Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, and I could not be more pleased with them and the entire process. At this point, it will be a fun adventure as to what they yield at their auctions! ",

    "text": "I woke up today and realizes it’s time to start selling some cards, I’ve definitely went a bit crazy since starting in this hobby. I’ve been selling on eBay for a long time, mostly sneakers, Supreme, vinyl art driven toys and Hot Wheels etc. I’m by no means a newbie to eBay but I’ve never sold cards before. I was also considering Whatnot but only from a store perspective, I have zero interest in the business of breaking, although I enjoy watching it. I find the platform easy to use.\n\nI’ll probably just sell slabs as I have thousands of singles to sort through. I buy what I like, but I think it’s best to stick with my favorite drivers at this point. I’m an entrepreneur in real life so even with collecting I typically buy right with the idea of getting out whole, or even with some profit, which I just roll into more purchases, it’s a crazy cycle but I enjoy it.\n\nAnyway I’ve looked at the sellers I’ve purchased from, and most seem to be large organizations. In my head I’m playing around with shipping, do I go free or somewhere in the middle.? I hate when I buy something and it ships first class without tracking, I absolutely want to use  ground advantage and probably boxes for everything. I’m a little surprised everybody uses bubble mailers, bulk boxes, especially small aren’t that expensive. \n\nI was just wondering if anyone here sells on eBay and had any tips. I’ve always been pretty good with comping my items so it’s really more the logistics that have me thinking about things, thanks!",

    "text": "For some context...I'm not sure if this kind of thing seems important to you guys. To give you some context, it is a very old domain (more than 24 years old). As a digital strategy and SEO guy, I would say its quite a missed opportunity...it used to belong to this American guy that was using it as his personal \nwebsite, not keen to sell, but he let it expire, then it went into auction. If you're not a domain investor, you might consider $2759 pretty expensive, but for a national treasure and \"jiwa bangsa\" I would say its a really good price. I unfortunately got to know about the auction during the last 5 minutes.\n\nPantas.com sold for $5000, Pinjam.com for $7500, Merdeka.com for $3000...so $2759 for Bahasa.com is quite a bargain. Whoever owns it now can easily charge 10x what they bought for it, and define the term Bahasa, and most likely an Indonesian will buy it. Because thats what happened to Merdeka.com, sad isn't it...such a meaningful word.\n\nWould you have spent the money? I see a lot of people here passionate about Bahasa, and owning something like that would essentially mean the ability to define the language and coin new words...people would trust the first search engine result more than DBP. \n\nI personally think thar \"defending Bahasa\" is less about arguing what is and isn't culture, and being able to define the term and ensuring the usage of the words and language survive future generations. Having a business or startup with a Bahasa term is one way to define its meaning, like what I plan to do with Soal.my. Indonesia's attempt to claim the Kebaya (yes the dress)  their national heritage was led by their countries national domain registrar, of all gov agencies. \n\nAt that time they used kebaya.id as the campaign site, which works really well cause .ID doesn't just connotate Indonesia, it connotates identity too. Of course UNESCO didn't let them claim it. But they did try. Its kind of sad how I used to build websites on Merdeka.com but my friend sold it cause he needed the money. Its Indonesia's biggest media portal now btw. \n\nI'm aware this a really obscure hobby, and most people misunderstand it. But if there was any way to learn the language, and have fun and make money at the same time, buying/selling and developing worthy names into high traffic sites would be the way. If you're keen to learn though, do let me know. ",

    "text": "I’ve been in the hobby for a while and mostly buy singles, but I wanted to try Fanatics Collect’s Instant Rip just to see how everything works. Dropped $250 on a basketball pack just out of curiosity.\n\nI actually pulled a legit grail: a 2014 LeBron James patch card. Their system immediately showed a “value” around $1,400, which made no sense at all. Realistic value is maybe $500 to $600. So I skipped their whole end-of-process valuation and took the $1,200 instant credit. That part was easy.\n\nEverything after that… not great.\n\nThe user interface feels like it was designed by someone who doesn’t collect. It’s clunky, the layout is strange, and finding basic info takes more taps than it should. Their weekly auction structure also feels odd. Maybe there’s a reason for it, but from the outside it just seems limiting.\n\nTheir Card Ladder pricing is rough. They’re pulling comps from 2022, so you basically have to bounce between eBay and their app to figure out real values. It slows everything down and makes it hard to trust what you’re looking at.\n\nI used my $1,200 credit toward an overpriced 1980 Topps Bird–Magic–Dr. J rookie PSA 7 listed at $1,600. I paid the extra $400 cash to cover the difference and added it to my collection. Cool.\n\nThen I tried to withdraw it.\n\nThey hit me with a $75 fee.\n$48 to “withdraw” the card, with no explanation or breakdown.\n$25 shipping.\nPlus tax.\n\nPaying $75 just to get a card in hand is wild. It makes the whole thing feel like a cash grab built on keeping you inside their ecosystem and charging you every time you try to leave it.\n\nAt this point I’m deleting the app and won’t be using it again.

He said he got it from 2020 archive hobby box\n\n But here we have to think.\n\nArchive is a product that sells buy back cards in a box.\n\n By the way, was there cracked ice in 2018 topps chrome? There wasn't.\n Therefore, 2020 Archive 2018 topps chrome cracked ice can't exist\n\n The second reason why that card is fake is \"auto\"\n\n Unless it is done by a robot, the location and size of the auto will inevitably vary from card to card.\n\n But if you compare the BGS certified 2020 archives 2018 topps chrome ohtani auto 1/1 and auto with it's a perfect match. There's no difference at all.\n(The third picture)\n\nIn other words, the BGS certified card was culled and printed. I made a fake card\n\n And this is the last reason why this card is fake.\n\n If you use a pen for an auto on the card, the auto covers the surface of the card. Everyone knows this\n\n But the cracked ice pattern covers the auto lol\n(The 4th picture)\n\n This can't happen.\n\n That means it's a card that's printed by an individual. Auto is not real either\n\n On these grounds, I told the seller that it was a fake card. The seller insisted to the end that this card was obtained from 2020 archive hobby box. And he blocked me\n\nIt's a fake card no matter who looks at it, why is it doing this? If you sell a fake card, why do you sell a fake card like that even though whatnot app processes a refund?\n\n I'm a South Korean.

I have a few cards vaulted with GameStop power packs and I’m wondering if they will show up in the eBay app as well. I believe this is fairly new and the FAQ says that it can take several weeks if cards to show up.\n\nThis all makes me think about the underwear that sold on eBay a few months ago. That felt like the beginning of a new partnership. Think about it, other than GameStop, where else would you go to buy used video games? EBay. A partnership with EBay and PSA with card buying and selling + grading + used video games. This could be part of the digital transformation.",

Since Fanatics acquired them in 2022 I feel Topps and their other brands Allen & Ginter and Bowman have just fallen off. \n\nBased off of the reactions I saw yesterday over the Topps Cosmic Chrome release I feel Fanatics is just after nothing but money. The huge price alone was one thing but then the lack of guarantees of auto or relics just blew my mind. I grew up ripping packs with my dad and loving every second of it but now… I mean these prices and then being told “hey you might only get base cards” is a wild wild approach. ",

I am trying to get rid of old stuff, because I am moving to a new place. I am not too familiar with the value of the cards, and I am not familiar with most of the players. I recently found out about PSA Vault, but am still confused on my next steps.\n\nI am trying to save time. Should I send the whole collection to PSA Vault and have them take care of everything? Or should I sift through all the cards and sort what I believe to be valuable, then ship those to PSA Vault? And then sell those \"junk\" cards in bulk on eBay? \n\nI just want to make sure I am getting the most amount of money from this collection. I looked through the PSA Vault eBay store, and I see that there are some cards of not-so-famous players selling for a $20+ per card. Please go easy on this ignorant fella, just trying to get rid of old items, thank you LOL.\n\nEdit: This collection is from 20+ years ago. All raw cards, no graded.

My biggest question is are we going to keep getting Topps brand basketball cards or is Fanatics going to release their own line? Is Panini still going to release all its same lines season, but unlicensed? And what happens to all the premium/unique lines like immaculate, national treasures, court kings, black, etc.  Panini had so many lines that took them so many years to build, do you guys think we’re just going to have one or two tops basketball lines for the next few seasons? And then what happens to all the penny cards that exist with a licensing? Will they eventually lose any value? So many questions! Thanks!",

And 5 Reasons Comic Collection Platforms Beat Spreadsheets (and Raw AI)\n\nDon't ditch your collection management platform just yet! AI can help you discover some fun insights about your collection, but you still need a source of data to track, update and manage your comic books.\n\n**TL;DR – Why Comic Collection Platforms Beat Spreadsheets**\n\n* **Real-time values:** Get automatic pricing updates from live market data—no more manual research or outdated estimates.\n* **Smarter cataloging:** Add issues instantly using built-in databases with covers, variants, and creator details.\n* **Visual browsing:** View your collection as a gallery instead of a grid of cells—filter, sort, and enjoy the art.\n* **Always in sync:** Access your full collection anywhere with cloud backups and instant device sync.\n* **Community connection:** Discover new books, share collections, and compare notes with other collectors.\n* **Less work, more fun:** Ditch the spreadsheets—spend less time managing data and more time enjoying the hobby.\n\n# 1) Real-Time Valuation and Market Insight\n\nDedicated platforms pull in regularly refreshed pricing so you can see estimated fair-market value, recent movers, and trends at a glance. With a spreadsheet, you’d need to hunt values yourself, paste them in, and maintain error-prone formulas … every time.\n\n# 2) Streamlined, Error-Free Cataloging\n\nTools like [Zap-Kapow Comics Club](https://club.zapkapowcomics.com/) and [CLZ](https://clz.com/) use robust issue databases—creators, variants, barcodes, cover art—so adding books is fast and consistent. No typos, no duplicate rows, no broken VLOOKUPs.\n\n# 3) Visual and Interactive Experience\n\nCover galleries, rich filters, and “owned vs. wanted” views make collecting delightful and practical. Spreadsheets are utilitarian; dedicated apps make your collection feel like a collection.\n\n# 4) Cloud Sync and Cross-Device Access\n\nYour data is available on phone, tablet, and desktop with automatic backup and instant sync. Spreadsheets splinter into versions—*v3\\_final\\_FINAL.xlsx*—and fall out of date fast.\n\n# 5) Built-In Community and Discovery\n\nRecommendations, related issues, and optional sharing help you find what’s next and compare notes with other collectors. Spreadsheets can’t replicate that ecosystem … or the fun.\n\n# Bottom Line\n\nSpreadsheets are flexible but high-maintenance. A purpose-built comic platform gives you pricing, structure, visuals, sync, and community out of the box—so you can spend less time wrestling cells and more time collecting.",

My pre-grading standards are tough, and so far I’ve had about a 92% PSA 10 rate out of 103 total cards I’ve submitted. I know that’s not a massive number for some, but I’d say I’m fairly confident in my eye for grading.\n\nRecently, I sent in the card as shown in the pictures. The grader notes mentioned a dent along the right side (no specification if it was on the front or back). After checking it myself, showing it to a few friends and vendors who grade regularly, and even having Beckett take a look — everyone agreed there’s no dent at all. I even checked it under a blacklight and found nothing.\n\nI’ve helped friends crack and resend cards before, but I’ve never personally done a review submission — where you send in the slab as-is for PSA to reassess it.\n\nSo… what would you do? Crack and resend, or send for review? Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with similar situations.",

We soft-launched 3 months ago and have started sharing our tool with the smaller TCG communities, but we feel that the time has come to share it with the Riftbound community before the big launch.  \n  \n**👉** We’re opening 200 early-access invites to the Riftbound community here: [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=riftboundtcg](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=riftboundtcg)\n\n**We're giving away 1  Origins Booster Box to one of the first 200 player who:**\n\n1. Joins via the invite link\n2. Adds some cards to their collection\n3. Creates a list (trade / wishlist / decklist — your choice!)\n\nOur marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker will stay free forever. We're in this for the long haul - building the tools we wish existed to easily build decks, trade cards, and understand where your portfolio stands.\n\nWe're still in beta, and we're really looking for some feedback/ideas to improve it, especially from the early Riftbound community. What features would make this invaluable for you?\n\nNB: We have an active community on our Discord where you can provide feedback (see on our landing page), not yet on Reddit.",

    "text": "LINK TO ORIGINAL POST\n👉 https://www.reddit.com/r/basketballcards/s/JSkqKV4Rep\n\nBack in May, I sent my Kobe Bryant autograph (2015 Replay buyback) to Beckett for grading. A few days after they received it, they told me it needed to be authenticated first before it could be graded. I agreed, paid the extra amount, and even paid for their “5-day turnaround” service.\n\nThe rep I was dealing with, Zach, confirmed payment and said he had my card in hand. Then he apparently quit. A few weeks later, another Zach emailed saying he found my card sitting at the old Zach’s desk and would get it moving again. After that, communication basically stopped.\n\nMonths went by. I got duplicate invoices, automatic “unpaid” notices, and even emails warning that my card would be considered abandoned if I didn’t update my payment method — even though my card on file was active and being used for other Beckett orders. I kept emailing and calling, trying to get anyone to respond.\n\nEventually, a lead rep stepped in, apologized, confirmed my card was still in the building, and refunded me about 25% of what I paid for the delay. That part I appreciated — it finally felt like things were being handled.\n\nThen the card showed up this week… and they only authenticated it. No grade.\n\nAfter six months, two Zachs, a bunch of conflicting messages, and half a year of waiting, Beckett completed only half of the service I originally paid for. I’ve already reached back out asking them to fix it, expedite the grading, and make it right.\n\nHas anyone else had Beckett return a card authenticated-only when you paid for both grading and authentication?",

The **Anaheim Ducks**, meanwhile, are +250 to +260 (implied probability: \\~29-30%), which is basically the sportsbook’s way of saying, “Bet on the Ducks only if you’re feeling charitable.” The total goals line sits at **6.5**, with the under slightly more alluring (odds: \\~53%) than the over (\\~47%).\n\nBut here’s the rub: Implied probabilities are just numbers. Context is everything.\n\n---\n\n### Ducks: From “Why So Serious?” to “Why So Scoring?”\n\nThe Ducks, who haven’t sniffed the playoffs since 2018, are having a statistical renaissance. They’re fifth in the league in goals per game (3.63), a staggering leap from 30th last season. Credit goes to **Joel Quenneville**, the three-time Stanley Cup-winning coach who’s turned this team into a offensive juggernaut.\n\nKey players are firing on all cylinders:\n\n* **Troy Terry**, the Ducks’ scoring sparkplug, has nine points in his last three games and is on pace to eclipse his career-high 37-goal season.\n* **Beckett Sennecke**, the third-overall 2024 draft pick, is already showing playoff-level production (3 goals, 2 assists in 8 games). He’s like a rookie who aced the final exam on the first day of class.\n\nBut injuries linger like a bad Zamboni job: Captain **Radko Gudas** and star free-agent acquisition **Mikael Granlund** are sidelined with lower-body injuries (probably not from tripping over shoelaces, but one can hope). Forward **Chris Kreider** returns from illness, which is good news unless he’s still contagious.\n\n---\n\n### **Panthers: Two-Tim\n\nTo Be Continued...(full article) [https://www.gptsportswriter.com/prediction-detail/prediction-anaheim-ducks-vs-florida-panthers-2025-10-28/](https://www.gptsportswriter.com/prediction-detail/prediction-anaheim-ducks-vs-florida-panthers-2025-10-28/)",

Obviously I cannot send one-touches in the standard under 3oz first class shipping (too heavy/thick) and I don't want to pay $4-$5 to send out giveaways (I do 20-40 per show). I supposed I'll have to enable the first class shipping, and set the mag auctions at 4-7 oz... my concern is that me or my customers will be severely overcharged for shipping and I'll spend an hour every show submitting claims for reimbursement from Whatnot.

    "text": "So I  just got my Wayne Gretzky Topps rookie card back. Can someone explain this grade to me. It’s a EX-MT 6. The only thing wrong with this card is the centering on the back is off right to left. I’ve taken this to card shops and to sports card conventions and the dealers who I’ve talked to who also grade cards have all said that this would be a minimum 8.5 on the grading system, just because the centering on the back. I’ve held onto this card since I got it in a pack when I was a freshman in high school in 79-80 waiting to sell it. It looks like a defect on the top but it’s the lighting and reflection. The edges are all clean, the colors are still bright, it’s centered on the front almost perfect. There are no spots. I’m just devastated with this grade. Do you think the graders were just having a bad day? I just don’t get it, especially comparing these images with the cards that have sold on Heritage auctions with some of the issue they have like centering which had much higher grades than this. \n\nThanks in advance for any insight into this.",

    "text": "My youth was during the junk wax era (1985-1996) and the market had a hard crash. During the peak in the 1990s, even specialty stores and grocery stores carried a lot of cards. The only thing worth buying in the 90s, cards wise, was MTG but even MTG was hit by it. Homelands and Fallen Empires didn’t help. There were lots of TCGs trying to make it big like MTG but the bust crushed most of them by 1999.\n\nDuring the mid 90’s, a lot of MSM stories were done about card shows and people making $ by flipping right before the bottom fell out. They called it “buying and selling” back in our old fogey language. \n\nWell, I’m thinking we are at that same point again as CNBC has done its 3rd story on it after Kevin O’Leary talked about it 3-4 months ago. Are we at the top with next year bringing us a severe beating? I don’t think Xmas is ruined but the Pokebros have screwed up the MTG market and I see their home market as the root cause of the next downturn. It’s overprinted, overpriced and sold in grocery stores and sporting goods stores now. I’m looking to get out now with Xmas sales and but swing back around just for the Hobbit and duck out. Are the whatnot crews still selling or has it calmed down?",

I know there are reasons for this (RC, patch/ no patch, on card vs sticker etc etc), but it’s tough to nail down a solid value. \n\nThen there’s going about selling it. I just can’t figure out the best way of doing this. Incredible fees with eBay and Goldin, it’s just been tough to find the best way.\n\nSo I guess I’m just asking for advice here. How would you go about selling it and what would you expect to get for it? \n\nAnd thank you in advance to anyone responding, it is greatly appreciated. ",

    "text": "Anyone have experience buying through SCC consignments in Shanghai on Ebay since tariffs? They told me in a message that they ship “duty paid” so they cover tariffs. \n\nHas anyone ordered through them? Hopefully it’s true. They are a massive seller with 99.9 positive feedback. \n\nAlso - I wanted to share this, what I consider a little hack. \n\nThey charge 24.99 to ship - which from China makes sense…SO, generally you can buy auctions for at least 25 less than you would normally, plus even less because the shipping turns additional people away and a lot of people don’t want to wait a month for cards. BUT you can combine shipping for 1 dollar additional per card.  So here’s the hack. There are a ton of cards that start their bid at 99 cents. They might be a 5 or 6 dollar Jordan - but no one is paying 25 bucks to ship that card. So you can bid on your main card - for instance I just bought a Joe Montana PSA 7 card for 75 bucks less than I can sell it for. And now I’ll add like 10 additional 1 dollar cards for 10 bucks shipping. And the card will value probably 60 to 70 bucks! \n\n\n",

A little over a month ago I bought a break spot with Swish Breaks on Fanatics Live. In the break I  hit a Keon Coleman RPA  /25. A week or so later I received an empty bubble mailer. I reached out to Swish Breaks. They let me know they made an error and sent the card out to the wrong address. They stated they were having the card sent back to them and then they would send to me. I reached out again about a week later and they responded they were still waiting on the card. I reached out again a week after that to get an update and they did not respond. After several days of no response from Swish Breaks I reached out to Fanatics support. They responded quickly and offered me a credit.  I declined the credit as I stated I had no reason to use their app anymore if they were going to allow their sellers to act in bad faith. They then offered to double the initial credit offer (value was more than the card was worth) to which I politely declined again based on the reason I previously stated. In defense of Fanatics Live I will say after years of occasional breaking this is the only issue I have had and they did quickly respond and offer a remedy. To me though, I only break with sellers that operate in good faith and Swish Breaks broke that trust. FL support stated they “reported” Swish Breaks for the incident but I wanted to let everyone in here know they are not a good faith seller. ",

Feels like the online market is splintered and while I hated eBay for fees, it was a pretty safe place for buyers and it was  kind of nice almost everyone/thing was there.",

    "text": "So I started selling my most valuable cards on TCGplayer two weeks ago, bc my family has been on hard times lately and we need the money. Everything was going fine and I’m not sure why they would freeze the seller account. I mailed everything the day of order, and made sure to mark it shipped. The only mistake I made was once I accidentally shipped a large order without tracking (I thought letter track was enough but I emailed support and they said it doesn’t count, but they didn’t indicate they would freeze the account just that I need to use certified mail next time which I did). I’m concerned about where my money is going to go on the orders I already sold. I calculated it and I’ve sold $430 worth of cards in about 17 orders. I know it’ll take a while for them to put it in my account but it’s now saying there is a hold on my payments too. Are they just keeping the money from my card sales? Is this a common issue on TCGplayer? I’m worried I’m going to get burned. I’ve emailed them but no answer. ",

After receiving it, I had it physically authenticated by PCA (Professional Cards Authenticator), a trusted grading/authentication company in Europe.\n\n👉 PCA officially confirmed in writing that the card is a counterfeit. I have the certificate from them proving this.\n\nHowever, Whatnot’s Trust & Safety team replied to me saying the card is authentic because they checked it using LegitApp – an app that only reviews photos, not the actual card. They are ignoring the PCA attestation and refusing to process my refund.\n\nThis is extremely frustrating, because:\n\nPCA examined the card physically, not just a picture.\n\nWhatnot is relying on a mobile app over a recognized professional authenticator.\n\nI’m now stuck with a fake card and no refund, unless they reconsider.\n\n\nHas anyone else here dealt with similar issues with Whatnot?\nWhat are the best next steps – pushing again with PCA’s document, contacting my payment provider, or escalating legally?\n\nThanks in advance for any advice – I don’t want other collectors to get scammed the same way.",

    "text": "I've heard all the stories about PSA and how they treat their customers, so this isn't that much of a surprise to me, however I wanted to bring it to everyone's attention in case you decide and sell your freshly graded PSA cards directly back to PSA using their new(ish) offer feature.\n\nI received my grading order back last week, and I gemmed this Marv Jr card. The offer from PSA was actually decent, and they let you know you have 24 hours to accept the offer. I thought about it for awhile, and with a few minutes left in the 24-hour window, I accepted the offer. See attached image showing what they were offering. The final acceptance screen displayed the same $164 offer amount.\n\nA few hours later I went back into the site to make sure everything went through, and in my sold section PSA shows they bought the card for only $114, not the $164 they told me was what I was selling the card for... SAY WHAT!?\n\nThe attached is PSA's response to me. Basically saying that you have to hit refresh on the final acceptance screen to get the most up to date offer. So their UX system depends on customers hitting refresh. That is ridiculous. **The final acceptance screen should automatically generate and show the correct final offer. period.**\n\nThey also mentioned this has been an issue with other customers as well which is not surprising since nobody would ever think the system would be so stupid that it relies on people hitting refresh before they accept an offer.\n\nThey offered nothing to me. No refund on the amount I thought I was selling for. Not just canceling the sale and shipping the card back to me. No discount codes for grading in the future. Nothing.\n\nAlso, crazy that the offer price can change that much (30%) in a 24-hour window.\n\nSo, if you sell your graded cards back to PSA be very careful about the offer amount as their system doesn't work correctly and their \"customer service\" will do absolutely nothing about it, which is probably par for the course for PSA right?\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uw2ib8xr25sf1.png?width=1498&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bcfd992e270cdc8f2838dea3e8fe9855557d186\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6dw688xr25sf1.png?width=1966&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f2af656372279a15375a6eee5346d73e8884373",

This was the only moment in the game where I began to lose my sanity.  Not even the Sands was this irritating.  Respawning flies with RNG spawn locations, anti-healing maggots, evasive dart throwers, tight platforming, and an entire multi-wave arena battle against the aforementioned enemies before the actual boss.  This is the boss that made me realize how much I despise the Shard system for punishing failure even worse than just having to run back.

Spam tools if you got em, and if health permits you can let him eat you and attack internally for massive damage. !<\n\n>!I love this game but this entire area feels intentionally spiteful...which I guess fits the lore, but there was no positive experience to be found here other than the music.

    "text": "I’m pretty new to magic, I started last month with a friend and we’ve been enjoying it so far. He got into it cause of arena and the collabs, while I got into it because I love Final Fantasy, especially FF7. So because of my love for FF and FF7, I naturally want to collect all the FF7 cards. So I went onto tcgplayer and looked at the Sephiroth cards. I saw the full art Fabled Soldier and instantly fell in love with the look of the card but the price threw me off. $70 for a card seems so insane to me that I threw away the idea right away. \n\nSo fast track to today, I go to a card shop to just go look around and maybe get a commander set or a few singles and that’s when I saw the full art foil borderless Sephiroth Fabled Soldier. I asked how much it was and ofc it was $75. I said that’s a bit much for me and went home. When I got home I was talking to my mom about it and how I don’t understand why cards are so expensive. Just normal talk yk.\n\nWell she went out to get groceries and without me knowing, went to the card shop and asked about it. Well she bought it, she bought the $75 card. I’m very grateful and I was extremely happy but now I feel guilty. I don’t like that she bought it because it bothers me that she spent $75 on a card when that money could’ve been used for something else. \n\nI’ve been thinking of returning the card and getting her money back because even though I love the card, I can’t even touch it without feeling wrong. Ik it’s just a card and in all reality it’s not that deep but I bothers me so much that I would much rather shred the card than keep it at this point. \n\nWhat do you guys think? Do you think I’m overthinking and overreacting?\n\nTLDR: Mom buys $75 card and I want to return it because spending that much on a card makes me feel terrible and the fact I didn’t buy it using my own money is eating at me.\n\n(Edit) I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did. I am having trouble answering all 600+ people in the comments but I want everyone to know that I appreciate all of your responses and I’m now leaning more towards keeping the card. I just wish I could thank everyone of you individually and answer everyone. I still would appreciate anyone else who would like to share their opinions on this matter.",

    "text": "Just wanted to share my negative experience with \"Break'n Bad\" on fanatics live as an FYI to others. Since July I have spent over $925 with that shop purchasing various online cards breaks including one where I paid a little over $37 for a Topps Chrome Jumbo pack. I received the package on time but it only contained cards pulled from other orders I placed with them and no Jumbo Pack (I did receive a second Jumbo Pack I bought in a separate purchase/shipment just fine the same week). I messaged them through the fanatics site, got a couple replies including \"our shipping team may have just missed including that pack\", but its now been a week with no follow-up or resolution from them. I just filed a complaint with Fanatics, hoping they can help get this resolved, but its a let down to spend that much money with someone only to end up getting ignored when things go wrong. That's not the customer service someone would expect when a company drops the ball. Until this point, my experience with them was otherwise positive, but when someone doesn't fix their mistake that's a deal breaker for me, so I will not be purchasing again from them and will likely stop the whole site altogether, if fanatics can't make it right.\n\nUpdate 9/16/25: I filed a claim with Fanatics-live as previously stated (who responded very quickly) and received an update from the shop shortly thereafter (not sure if it was cause-and-effect or not). Just got a replacement jumbo pack from the shop, so they did ultimately make good on their end. Overall, its good to see both the shop and fanatics provide resolution, but it did unfortunately result in having to jump through several extra hoops on my side.",

    "text": "Hi all. Figured I would share my experience with selling some graded cards on eBay through PSA after they are done grading. I’ve avoided it for a long time but lately have relented on a few orders because of how long PSA takes to send my cards back to me after completing the grades. (They used to get shipped back same day, now PSA holds them hostage for a week with the hopes I will let them sell the cards and make even more money off of me)\n\nSo first of all- the positives. It does remove the hassle of listing, selling and shipping the cards yourself. Additionally, once payment is received from the buyer you are safe and the money is yours. (No worrying about the buyer claiming the slab is damaged or pulling some sort of scam). Also, the fee structure can be slightly more favorable than eBay.\n\nAnother relatively nice positive is that PSA will give you cash offers for your vaulted slabs on occasion. The offers are, in my experience, usually very competitive and close to what you’d make if you sold it on eBay (sometimes even a bit more).\n\nThat all sounds great, but there are some glaring negatives.\n\nFor whatever reason, PSA is very lenient with allowing buyers to pay for the slabs once they are purchased. I believe they give the buyer 7 days to pay regardless of whether it’s an auction or a Buy it Now listing. This leads to many buyers who simply don’t pay and you have no way to contact the buyer and no recourse.\n\nThis is very annoying and I don’t understand why it works this way. When selling on eBay myself, I can require immediate payment for buy-it-now listings. Why doesn’t PSA do this? Who knows. Maybe they don’t want to deal with chargebacks. \n\nThat leads me to the real reason I made this post and why I won’t ever recommend selling valuable slabs through this service. If you sell a buy it now listing through PSA and the buyer flakes, your card enters some sort of weird purgatory phase. It shows up as being listed on eBay in your vault, but the listing shows that the item is out of stock since it “sold”.\n\nYou cannot relist the card or cancel the listing. You can’t do anything, in fact. And PSA’s customer service is surprisingly unhelpful (they are usually pleasant and responsive). I’ve sent numerous inquiries about cards in this status and keep getting the run-around response that the issue has been “escalated”.\n\nI assume I will eventually get this sorted out and my card will be available to me. But it’s been 2+ weeks and the slab value has decreased significantly in that time.\n\nPSA obviously desperately wants us to let them sell the cards (just look at their last two monthly “grade and sell” specials) but I would seriously reconsider given some of the issues with actually getting payment.

    "text": "Dear r/mtgfinance Community,\n\nWe are three friends passionate about Magic (and a few more TCGs since then) who quit our day jobs late last year to fulfill an old dream of starting our own company.  \n  \nAfter years of playing Magic competitively and trading cards at events across the US, we kept running into the same problems. Tracking our collection values was a mess of spreadsheets. Organizing trades meant juggling TCGPlayer tabs and scattered notes. And we never really knew our portfolio's true performance over time.\n\nSo we built CardNexus - a modern portfolio tracker designed specifically for serious TCG players and collectors who care about value.\n\n**What we've built for MTG:**\n\n* A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch)\n* Week-on-week portfolio tracking - see  how your collection's value changes over time\n* Real-time price tracking synced with the two major marketplaces\n* Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early\n* Custom lists for trades and deck building\n* Support for all MTG formats and sets (plus 5 other TCGs if you're diversified, such as Sorcery, Flesh and Blood, One Piece, Lorcana, and Pokemon)\n\n**This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on user feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 7 weeks ago and have started sharing our tool with the smaller TCG communities but we feel that the time has come to share it with the MTG community. \n\n**Today, we're opening 200 beta spots specifically for the** r/mtgfinance **community.**\n\n**The hook:** We're giving away a $200 MTG booster box (your choice from TCGPlayer) to one lucky member who joins via our link, uploads their collection, and creates a trade list! \n\nGet your invite here: [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=mtgfinance](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=mtgfinance)\n\nOur marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker will stay free forever. We're in this for the long haul - building the tools we wish existed to easily build decks, trade cards, and understand where your portfolio stands. [tps://discord.com/invite/xfDUvn5g2g](https://discord.com/invite/xfDUvn5g2g)\n\nWe're still in beta, and we're really looking for some feedback/ideas to improve it, especially for the MTG community.  What features would make this invaluable for you r/mtgfinance community? \n\nNB: We have an active community on our Discord where you can provide feedback (see on our landing page), not yet on Reddit: [https://discord.com/invite/xfDUvn5g2g](https://discord.com/invite/xfDUvn5g2g)\n\n",

    "text": "Normally I hate the bandwagon of \"I hate TCG/WOTC/CK/ETC\" posts but today I'm driving the bus.\n\nWhat the hell are we paying for with TCGPlayer Direct?\n\n# Act I: Card Availability\n\nFor roughly the past 12 months, the availability of Magic cards on TCGPlayer Direct plummeted. First they started dropping everything outside of the \"currently in print\" sets. Older cards, promo cards, etc.\n\nThen, you couldn't even get the most recent set - high demand pushed even basic commons and uncommons out of availability for Direct packages. Today, I cannot get half of EOE through Direct. Most of the chase foils / borderless foils / etc. are marked up 50-150% from the non-Direct offerings. It's at the point where I'm lucky if I can get 1-2 cards at a time in the same direct package when I'm building a deck.\n\nWith absolutely no consistent stock, and with a majority of cards across the entire game unavailable, even qualifying for your perks is impossible unless you're playing Thunder Junction Block Constructed.\n\n# Act II: Shipping\n\nOk, I found my card and it's available and I place an order. Problem solved? NO!\n\nAt minimum there's a 7-day wait before my cards ship. During Final Fantasy, this exploded to 20-30 days of waiting for packages to ship. I know they moved locations to Louisville during this time, so I was patient, but that was three months ago and I have cards I ordered 10 days ago sitting there with \"Shipping Not Confirmed.\"\n\nWhen they do ship, I get a \"fake\" tracking number. It doesn't track cards, it doesn't even confirm that the carrier has the package - the tracking number MIGHT update after the package is delivered, 10+ days after it shipped.\n\nSo I waited 2-5 weeks for my cards to arrive, with no tracking. What am I paying for Direct for?\n\n# Act III: Robo-Hailey\n\nWhen I do have issues, I reach out to customer service, and in the past I would be very helpfully and happily answered by Hailey from TCGPlayer. It was a great bonus of the service and \"TCG Has your back\" was a good mantra for buyers from the program's inception to around January 2025.\n\nToday, I get what I call \"Robo-Hailey\" (no slight to the real Hailey, if indeed she exists). I get spun around and around with automated responses. These responses are completely disconnected from my questions.\n\nIf I write and ask \"hey, how come you haven't shipped my package after seven days\" I get an unrelated boilerplate AI response about carrier delays. Guess what, it's not March 2020, there are no carrier delays, all my non-TCG packages are arriving just fine. The carrier can't have a delay if you don't hand them a package!\n\nThree or four times they told me it was an error in my listed address. The one I placed 2,000 orders with over 5 years? \n\nI have started flagging anything I say as \"other\" because it's the only way to get eyes on the question, days later.\n\n# Epilogue\n\nI'm not an unreasonable person. TCG Direct was worth every penny when they started, and for years afterwards. I am not sure why the quality has declined to this point, but I've reached my threshold. Literally every line of text in their description of the Direct service is now a lie:\n\n1. **Free Tracked Shipping:** No, it's not tracked at all.\n2. **Your Order Ships First:** First?? I'd hate to see how long it takes for orders shipped last!\n3. **Extra Store Credit:** Used to be. Now there's a $35 threshold before the package qualifies. I have gone multiple months without triggering it at all. They also used to stack bonuses for subscribers - that happens MAYBE once a year now? From 2023-2024 I covered my subscription cost with store credit and now I get almost nothing. This perk has evaporated.\n4. **Earn Subscriber-Only Promos Throughout the Year:** What? Where? Has anyone seen these? I have been a subscriber since the MONTH THEY LAUNCHED and I have never received a promo, ever.\n5. **Cards are Graded By Our Experts:** I have more issues with card quality from TCGPlayer Direct than I do from mom and pop sellers outside the service.\n\n# Say it louder for the people in the back: What Are We Paying For?",

Some fun chases, but possible \"scarcity overload?\"\n\nThe overall landscape for retail Chrome this year does not look good for value. If you must purchase retail, I recommend Fanatics Megas if at all possible.\n\n1. Autos are seeded at 1:5 boxes compared to 1:9.5 boxes in regular mega & 1:7.5 boxes blasters.\n2. Production of Fanatics Mega is about 9% that of reg megas. (210k pks vs 2.4m pks)\n3. Fanatics Megas contain 10 Topps Refractors (PR \\~1000ea), vs 10 X-Fractors in reg megas (PR \\~12k ea). So they should hold better value. However this may be based too much on logic as there are a couple things working against the \"Topps Refractors\" holding solid value-\n\na) Consumers must realize the scarcity in relation to other unnumbered refractors and unfortunately there are a number of other \"logo-style refractors\" (both Chrome and paper versions) with varying rarities they can easily be lumped in with. Personally, I have to look at my extensive notes to remind myself of the differences on these so how is the average consumer supposed to know?\n\nb) If you have tried searching ebay for these \"Topps refractors\", you know it's super wonky and there's no good way to do so. I feel if Topps could have come up with a catchier name or style for these, it would help mightily, but they seem destined to get lost in the mix even though they are quite short printed.\n\n4) Fanatics Megas are the only format with a chance at Authentics Redemptions, which touts a nice checklist of subjects, but probably still does not justify the $80 premium price point.\n\nComparing 2025 Topps Chrome base production to prior years (does not include base from Logofractor boxes):  \n2025 (300 card set): 120,682  \n2024 (300 cards): 122,064  \n2023 (220 cards): 154,491  \n2022 (220 cards): 176,635  \n2021 (220 cards): 136,554  \n2020 (200 cards): 106,664\n\nWhen figuring print runs, I found it peculiar that base print runs (prior to adding Logofractor) were nearly identical for 2025 & 2024. Yet it seems like numbered cards and quality hits are so much tougher in 2025.\n\nSo I added up all unnumbered refractors + base inserts + all inserts with a print run of 500+ (so this includes case hits like Ultraviolet & Fanatical), for both 2025 Chrome & 2024 Chrome as increasing these can greatly affect production numbers without adding to base print runs.\n\n2025- 24.45m cards  \n2024- 17.95m cards  \nYOY diff- +6.5 million cards, or +36.2%\n\nThis is equivalent to 1.625m extra hobby packs (or 1.08m extra Mega packs) worth of extra minor parallels and inserts MORE THAN LAST YEAR. This is where the true bloat comes from and why I believe 2025 Topps Chrome is one of the worst Chrome releases in quite some time, even more so than the lackluster rookie class. \n\nTo break that down further, here are the print run increases of the most common unnumbered parallels:\n\nRefractor  \n2025: 15,670  \n2024: 12,961  \n\\+20.9%  \n  \nX-Fractors  \n2025: 11,623  \n2024: 6,868  \n\\+69.2%  \n  \nPrism Refractors  \n2025: 5,567  \n2024: 6,727  \n\\-17.2%  \n  \nRaywave  \n2025: 14,733  \n2024: 3,758  \n\\+292%  \n  \nSepia  \n2025: 12,409  \n2024: 5,752  \n\\+115.7%\n\nOverall production is only up about 11% (61.83m cards in 2025 vs 55.72m cards in 2024), but that's comprised almost entirely of unnumbered parallels. This is why the format with by far the biggest production increase is the Mega Box (+83.8% YOY when adding in Fanatics Megas). Mega boxes average 16.5 parallels/box, second only to Jumbos at 21/box. To compare, Hobby only has 8.66 parallels/box and Value Boxes average 11.25 parallel/box.\n\nMoral of the story- do not be duped by the \"loaded feel\" of blasters & megas because they have \"sooo many parallels bro\". Those parallels are dog shit.",

I have an appointment with Heritage Auctions this week regarding my late father's coin collection, and my husband has asked me to bring these along.                  Let me preface this by saying I have not been researching coins for very long.Tomorrow will be the first time I have seen my father's collection. I knew he had one, I guess I just always thought about it in the abstract.                                                                                      Back to the pennies.While I know you don't come across error coins every day, I know there are a lot that probably slip through the cracks. My husband likes to put away anything he finds interesting. These are the two best examples of coins he has saved, at least for photos. Most I have to view through a jeweler's loupe to discern the difference. The color difference is obvious, I'm just not sure what that means. I would love to hear any opinions you may have on them.                                   I have read all the reviews of Heritage, and I need to know I won't be walking in there unprepared. I will have less than a week to review my dad's collection, and I would like to be sure I have some basic knowledge  before I get there.                                                                    Having said that, I may be reaching out for more advice in the next few days. Any help would be appreciated.Thanks in advance for your time:)",

Joe Snake Eyes v1 Strait Arm with Cobra Commander Offer AFA 85 \\*\\* POP 4, Highest Grade \\*\\* (Hasbro, 1982).** One of the most iconic action figures of the 1980s, Snake Eyes made his debut in Hasbro's 1982 relaunch of *G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero* as part of the original 9-back assortment. With his all-black commando gear, mysterious masked appearance, and silent-but-deadly persona, Snake Eyes quickly became a defining figure in the line, cementing his legendary status in both toy and comic book history. This version features the early Cobra Commander mail-away offer, placing it among the earliest packaging variants for the character. Graded AFA 85 Y-NM+ with subgrades of C80 B85 F90, this example is a POP 4 and stands as the highest graded example known to exist, with none graded higher. The yellowed bubble is typical for early G.I. Joe releases but remains clear and intact, and the overall presentation is exceptional. An absolute grail for G.I. Joe collectors, early cardback enthusiasts, or anyone building a top-tier run of the most important characters in action figure history, this is a flagship piece that rarely appears in this condition. A definitive version of a pop culture icon.  \n  \nHeritage Auctions provides as much information as possible but strongly encourages in-person inspection.

I was discussing the card with the PSA rep and we were talking about whether it graded as a 10. While he obviously couldn't guarantee anything. He thought the card looked like it could be a 10 because he saw nothing wrong with it after inspecting it closely. I get the card back and it's an eight and the all four corners are damaged.  Obviously upset I didn't reach out to PSA but I should have. \n\nI recently submitted a jumbo Paul Skenes autographed card and it comes back looking like it was drug through gravel on the top edge with smudges. And then I look at the bottom left corner and the case looks like it was smashed against the ground. The crazy thing is the box didn't look damaged enough to where this could have happened while it was in the box during shipping. \nWTF PSA...\nAnyone experience this?\n\nI will never get something graded by PSA again! \n\nUPDATE:  I received an email from a customer care agent at PSA asking me to resubmit my claim under Quality Assurance Request.

The clock just kept resetting like some busted alarm clock from 2002. No visible bids, just endless “extensions.”\n\nI asked support and their answers got progressively more ridiculous:\n\n* *“Users are familiar with this function.”* Translation: the veterans already know the timer is fake, congrats rookie.\n* *“We hear you and are ready to defend our model.”* Translation: “Yes, our clock lies, but we’ll fight you for it.”\n* And the grand finale: *“If any card gets a bid, the entire auction resets.

    "text": "*I posted on this mid the flurry and got several dozen DMs, now that I'm through I'm posting more details if others find it helpful.*\n\nI started casually selling on tcgplayer at the beginning of June to establish an account so I could sell my collection singles easily. I hit seller level 4 on 27 June.\n\nAround this time I ran some numbers and noticed a set of sealed products that averaged 260% value when sold as singles. I also noticed < 10 sellers were cracking and selling this, and it was not listed on mtgstocks or mox alpha. I sold the ones I had as a test run and as it worked, I rapidly ramped up the volume.\n\nI tracked seller volume, singles value and sealed value daily to get an idea of when to stop buying sealed, and figured I had about 4-5 weeks before the arbitrage was gone.\n\nMy predictions were fairly accurate, and by the end of July margin was < 40% before fees so I stopped aggressively pricing and selling.\n\nDid this for fun and to learn the seller market.\n\n# 4 week stats - 30 June to 30 July\n\n* Net sales: $29,604.34 \n* Orders: 1827 \n* Sealed products cracked: 70 \n* Net per order: $25.50 \n* Net after fees: $25,808.99 \n* Sealed cost basis: $14,100 \n* Postage, supplies: $2,500 \n* Profit: $9,208\n\n# Fulfillment Process\n\nHad a ton of fun doing trial and error on the packing and shipping process. By the end my speed maxed out at 30 orders in 60 minutes. This wasn't stable but > 20/hour was pretty consistent.\n\n* HP Laserjet B&W printer for packing slips\n* Thermal 4x6 label printer\n* 6 envelope for <= $50 orders\n* 4x8 bubble mailer for >= $50 orders\n* Pirateship for bubble mailer orders + tracking\n* Either stamps.com or tcgtracking.com + stamps.com for #6 envelope orders\n\n# Pulling\n\nBecause I was selling one set of sealed products with < 500 unique cards, I was able to use 2-4 card sorting trays, 1-4 slots per letter of the alphabet for rapid pulling. This made pulling a lot faster.\n\n# Packing\n\n* Top loaders\n* Shipping shields\n* Penny sleeves\n* Team bags\n* Larger team bags\n* Masking tape + dispenser\n* Packing tape + dispenser\n\nAll packing slips folded 3x into a 4.25 x 2.75 dimension.\n\nSingle cards penny sleeved and then top loaded, and slotted into the packing slip fold face down so the card can't escape. Masking tape seal around the packing slip and top loader to fix together. Expensive single cards also get a team bag over the top loader Multiple cards get either a shipping shield or go into team bag with top loader backing Large orders go in larger slab team bags. All variations wrapped around folded packing slip and taped to secure. Expensive orders get a slab team bag around the whole thing.\n\nAll envelopes taped over on the backside with packing tape.\n\nAfter everything is packed, I review the PWEs for fat ones and added on non-machinable postage or extra ounce postage as needed.\n\n# Errors / Learnings\n\n* Because I fold the packing slip to have 3 paper layers on either end, I experimented with slotting < $2.00 order single cards in the middle of the packing slip, slotted so there's only an opening on one side, and taping that over with masking tape. While I got no reports of damage, two people badly reviewed there was no top loader so I stopped doing this right after the feedback.\n* I had an original bias for shipping shields, but moved over more to toploaders as I found more non-machinable postage issues with the shields.\n\n# Fallout\n\n* 100% positive feedback by the end\n* 4 negative reviews in total managed to get them all removed with refunds / replacements / working with tcgplayer\n* \\~15 missing packages, \\~5 showed up later on, the rest refunded.\n* \\~20 envelopes returned due to postage issues, some valid, some not\n* 3 mis-filled orders, corrected\n* \\~5 people provided bad addresses, I paid postage again for reshipment\n* 3 people reporting quality issues.\n\nFeel free to ask any other questions or things I can provide more detail on.",

I’m trying to make selling on TCGPlayer a legitimate side hustle so I can make at least some money back on playing this game.  My ultimate goal is to make Yugioh at least somewhat of a self sustaining hobby, which means selling bulk instead of just the shiny cards.  I just have a few questions on how to actually make that transition.\n\n1. Storage.  That’s the biggest one, I need a more effective storage solution for my cards.  What do you guys use as effective and concise storage that keeps large amounts of product safe and easy to access?\n\n2. Shipping.  What do you guys use to ship larger orders?  Bubble mailers or just PWE?  Are there any particular products you guys use that are good for sending multiple cards at once?  Right now, with my larger orders being only 3 cards, I just send in PWE with a top loader.  Also, do you guys tend to use stamps or do you go into the post office and pay for shipping there?\n\n3. Pricing.  How do you guys to price the cards and shipping?  I know TCGPlayer is all about competitive pricing, so how do you guys price your cards to get buyers interested without losing money?",

    "text": "GameStop isn’t just selling PSA-graded cards. They’ve engineered a system where they can *profit multiple times* from the same card, without printing a single one, all thanks to their genius buyback loop.\n\n# Here’s how it works:\n\nYou buy a Power Pack. Let’s say the $100 Gold tier.\n\nInside is one PSA-graded trading card, supposedly worth around $100 on average (according to GameStop’s own figures, yes some will get higher, but the overall average will equal the price of the pack).\n\nYou don’t want the card? GameStop offers to buy it back instantly for 90% of its value, minus a 6% commission. So you get back $84.60.\n\n# Here’s the clever part:\n\nThey just bought back a card worth $100... for $84.60.\n\nThey can now reseal it into another Gold Pack and sell it again for $100.\n\nThat’s a $15.40 margin, *without any new sourcing, grading, or logistics cost*. Just buy low, sell high, and loop it.\n\n# Average Profit Per Pack (If Card Is Recycled Into New Pack):\n\n🟢 Starter ($25)  \nBuyback: $21.15  \nResell: $25  \n**Profit: $3.85**\n\n⚪️ Silver ($50)  \nBuyback: $42.30  \nResell: $50  \n**Profit: $7.70**\n\n🟡 Gold ($100)  \nBuyback: $84.60  \nResell: $100  \n**Profit: $15.40**\n\n🔵 Platinum ($500)  \nBuyback: $423  \nResell: $500  \n**Profit: $77**\n\n🔷 Diamond ($1,000)  \nBuyback: $846  \nResell: $1,000  \n**Profit: $154**\n\nAnd that’s not counting the original margin from the first sale, which could be another 30 to 50 percent depending on sourcing and grading costs.\n\n# Why This Matters:\n\nThis system creates a flywheel where:\n\n* GameStop gets paid to sell a card\n* Gets the card back at a discount\n* Sells it again at full price\n* Repeats as long as demand exists\n\nThey’re not speculating on card value. They *control the supply, the pricing tier, and the resale loop*. It’s vertical integration disguised as a loot box.\n\nNow imagine when they expand beyond Pokémon and Football cards, into Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, Funkos, CGC comics, even sealed games. Every category added increases their recycling inventory and potential margin.\n\n# TLDR;\n\nPowerPacks aren’t just about cards. The real edge is the buyback loop. On average, GameStop pays less than market for returned cards, then sells them again at full price. Every cycle is a profit opportunity.\n\nIt’s repeatable. Scalable. Efficient. And it doesn’t rely on retail footfall or console cycles.\n\nPowerPacks might end up being GameStop’s most profitable product yet.",

Hype is high, but hard numbers are scarce. This launch is GameStop’s most substantial action in driving revenue growth, taking the company from stabilizing operations to growth focused. The goal of this post is to quantify the potential revenue if the feature scales, lay out every assumption in plain sight, and call out both the upside (PSA partnership, 6 % fee edge) and the obstacles (inventory, eBay’s dominance).\n\n**Key facts that anchor the model**\n\n|Fact|Why it matters|\n|:-|:-|\n|**5.6 M** paying PowerUp Rewards Pro members (56.7 M total)|Built‑in early‑adopter pool|\n|**600 k+** sports‑card transactions *per week* on eBay (≈31 M/yr)|The market share GME can nibble away at|\n|**$245 M** of June‑’25 hobby spend flowed through eBay (80 % share)|eBay’s fee load (\\~13 %) is Power Packs’ wedge|\n|**$211 M** collectibles revenue in GME Q1 FY25 (+55 % YoY)|Cards are already a core pillar—Power Packs just digitises it|\n|**$33 B** global trading‑card market, growing **22 % CAGR**|Plenty of runway|\n\n*(Sources: Shacknews, Chasing Majors, CLLCT, PR Newswire)*\n\n**Assumptions you can tweak**\n\n* Average selling price (ASP) per pack = $37\n* Pack mix = 80% $25 | 15% $50 | 4% $100 | 1% $500\n* Instant flip‑rate = 70% of packs\n* Instant‑sale fee = 6% of 90% cash offer = 5.4% of ASP\n* Shipping fee (when collectors withdraw) = $5 on 20% of kept slabs\n* Buyers per month & packs per buyer = see scenarios below\n\n**Twelve‑month run‑rate scenarios**\n\n*\\*Note: These numbers will take time to reach and the total revenue is for the full year.

This is only meant to be the start of this analysis.\n\n**Why the PSA partnership is a game‑changer**\n\n* **Trust & Liquidity** – PSA‑10 slabs sell instantly; no “raw vs. fake” headaches.\n* **Shared Vault Tech** – Same vault PSA bought from eBay, so chain‑of‑custody UX is familiar.\n* **Cost Edge** – Grading is prepaid. Normally you’d fork over a several dollars *per card* and pray for a 10; Power Packs skip that friction entirely.\n\n**Execution caveats to watch**\n\n|Limiting factor|Impact|\n|:-|:-|\n|**Inventory depth**|GME has to source *millions* of hot slabs; rookie QBs and vintage GOATs aren’t unlimited.|\n|**Habit gravity**|eBay moved $245 M of cards in one month and charges \\~13 % fees.

I am sure all reading this are aware that TCGplayer  is very problematic in 2025 and you have a high chance of getting screwed nowadays. Just happened to me too, I ordered a display of 1st edition Yugioh decks and received 2 loose decks instead of 10 shrinkwrapped, a roughly $700 delta between what I paid for and what I received. \n\nI am not sure why everyone seems to think this is the place to complain when your TCGplayer purchase goes wrong? Why not the tcgplayer subs or the main magic sub?\n\nThis sub was much more useful and interesting when it was discussing card and sealed specs, online sales/shipping discussion and strategy, card investments and portfolios, ya know mtg finance stuff. Nowadays its reading like a TCGplayer complaints box and I don’t think it’s very constructive for us to be naming and shaming unscrupulous sellers one at a time, which will achieve approximately nothing, when really the whole platform should be boycotted so they adopt better policies and protections for both sides. Not to mention their seller interface is still basically 90s internet, which is why I haven’t sold there for years. Anyway I love you all fellow mages just want to see the quality of this sub back to what it was, and to stop seeing yall get ripped off, so lets take our business to another platform! Thanks for reading\n\nEDIT:  I forgot to mention in the original post that the actual data on problematic sellers can be useful if properly organized into a sheet, I made that sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ETZRIbg7_68_W44ozD7MromwudIRucRPpUCwtpOXXI/edit?usp=drivesdk).

    "text": "I collected from 1994 to 2000, but mostly 96-98 years, and my brother and I shared an annual subscription monthly Beckett mags, my last issue was with Jay Williams on cover (Sep 2002). All our stuff has been in storage with A/C for 23 years. I'll make a separate post tomorrow about cards I've dug up, it's been a lot of fun sorting.     \nThe SI covers could be pretty wild. Going through these Becketts has been fun too and remembering how much I loved the By the Box reviews, which is basically what box preview YouTubers do now but in print. The impact of the dot com recession on card prices can be seen from the 2000 issues vs the late 2001-2002 issues too: For example, the my March 2000 issue has 1998 Black Diamond level 1 rookies going for $10 for guys like LaFrentz and  Bibby, $20-30 for guys like Jamison, Pierce and White Chocolate and up to $40 for Vince. Nov 2001 issue has Bibby and Jason Williams at $5, Pierce at $6, LaFrentz at $2, Jamison at $8, and Vince at $30.       \n                \nAlso never paid the grading section much thought back then, but interesting to look back on now. Prices are fascinating too, so many have gone up like crazy (e.g. Gem MT '86 Fleer MJ was priced at $2500 which is still under $5k after adjusting for inflation in today's dollars. 1998 E-X Dunk N Go Nuts were priced at $20-25 for Vince, Timmy, Hill, KG and Kobe with MJ at just $50) while many others are about the same or even less than back then (game worn jersey cards came out around then and had big premiums while it seems only the late 90s UD Game Worn jersey cards held value). Even found one that had Kwame Brown cards as the hottest cards that month, haha.",

    "text": "EDIT: Was asked by some people to ID the seller so they can block. Tag is: **cabaseball41**\n\nSome of you may have seen an initial post about this situation, but it finally came to a conclusion today so I wanted to post about it. I both buy and sell on Ebay, so I know mistakes happen sometimes. This situation is pretty wild though. On Sunday, May 11th 2025, I bought a sports card from a seller. The card in question was a Bowman Draft 2021 - Andrew Painter - Genesis - GNS-12 1/1 Superfractor. PSA Slab is 88537810.\n\nGiven the hype around this prospect, I expected the auction to skyrocket -- clearly the seller did too, as he had initially listed it a few times over the past year for $1,500. Well, at the end of this auction I came out as the winner...for $206. I was ecstatic & paid immediately. This didn't last though, as a few hours later I get a message from the seller: \"I am so sorry about this, went to print a label and ship your item and realized this was already sent to COMC 2 weeks ago by my partner after cross referencing the lists. I can offer you this same card on COMC for the same price as soon as it gets listed if thats ok?\".\n\nFor those who aren't aware, COMC is a trading card marketplace & consignment shop. Some sellers will send cards to COMC to have the sales managed by them. Its totally legit (I've bought COMC cards on Ebay before) but the cancellation was odd. See, he immediately cancelled the order (I didn't tell him to), and he chose 'Buyer Requested to Cancel' as the reason. When I noticed this a few days later, I reached out again & he said 'Honest mistake, that's my bad. I'll have it fixed'. I got on a call with support too, and they gave me the following advice: give it a few weeks to see if he truly honors the deal, and if not then leave negative feedback. I thought feedback wasn't an option because he said that I had chosen to cancel, but apparently since I paid right away it opened up the feedback form? Idk, I decided I'd wait it out.\n\nFast forward to June. I reached out on June 3rd for an update, and he said the cards were still in processing. Fine. Gave it a couple more weeks, and that brings us to today - June 18th. I said enough is enough, and I'll move forward with what the Ebay support specialist told me to do. Here's how the conversation went:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rd4myhn9p7f1.jpg?width=1594&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54b6dec235901c129404bbff475e9d38f3c998a9\n\nSo yea, lots to unpack there lol. To recap everything the seller did, he:\n\n1. Listed an item that he didn't have\n2. Wrongly cancelled a sale because he wasn't happy with the price\n3. Falsely claimed that the buyer cancelled the order\n4. Starts threatening the buyer when bad feedback comes in\n\nAt this point I'm fairly confident that the reason he cancelled is entirely based on him being unhappy with the selling price - his last message confirms that he viewed the sale as 'below market' and thought he could get more money for it. This isn't all though...there's a finale.\n\nI went back to this seller's feedback to see what experiences others had with him. Pretty sure I did this early on but I couldn't remember. His rating had dropped from 99.9% positive to 98.9% (he has a ton of sales on the account so 1% is a big drop). Upon looking at his negatives though, I found that in this May-June timeframe there have been 3 other buyers with the exact same story -- bought a card, paid immediately, then had it cancelled under the claim \"Buyer Requested to Cancel\". They all say they reach out and are told the same story about cards shipping to COMC. On top of that, two other buyers in the last month say he marked items as shipped but they weren't ever delivered, and then ended up on sale elsewhere. He responded to each one of these reviews (mine included) by lashing out, calling the buyers horrible and claiming they're lying. Its seriously crazy, not sure how Ebay is even letting this account stay open.\n\nAs a final thought - I'm not even saying he's lying about the COMC thing. It could absolutely be true that his partner sent the cards out and he mistakenly sold them (although I lean towards it being BS lol). Even if this *is* the case, to start lashing out in such a manner is totally unacceptable. Really shows the true colors, and IMO confirms that he was playing games the entire time given my message was completely civil and he followed up this way. So yea apologies for the book of the post but I wanted to share this somewhere hahaha.",

The seller opens the pack live and out comes… a Pokémon card. I was totally thrown off because I’d been watching him rip these same packs for a while and every single one had sports cards.\n\nI double-checked the manufacturer’s website just to be sure—and sure enough, those Galaxy Silver packs are 100% sports only. No Pokémon, no TCG, just sports.\n\nI reached out to the seller and explained the situation, asking for a refund. This morning, I got the classic “refund rejected” message with zero explanation. Fortunately, I reported the issue to Whatnot directly with all the screenshots and video evidence, and they processed a refund quickly.\n\nMoral of the story: stay alert and double-check what you're buying. Just because someone seems legit doesn’t mean they are. I’ll be sticking to eBay from now on. Lol.\n\nIf you're curious, the seller goes by:\n\notiasports\n\notiarips\n\notiatcg",

Vermutlich deswegen am Black lable vorbei...\n\n\\- Jolteon Terastial Festival, auch gezogen, hab mit ner 10 gerechnet\n\n\\- Gemini Elf, gekauft in Japan für 5000 Yen, war nicht perfekt also faires grade\n\n\\- Pikachu Stamp Box - war clean, hab ich erwartet\n\n\\- Celebi Gold Star, gekauft als GRAAD 7 (altes Slab) (250€) auf Cardmarket, cooles Upgrade\n\n\\- Mew Gold Star, gekauft in Japan (Osaka - BEE) für 50.000 Yen (300 €), happy über das grade\n\n\\- Mewtwo Gold Star, gekauft in Japan (Kyoto - Book Off) für 8.000 Yen (50 €), happy\n\n\\- Mc Donalds Pikachu und Slowpoke - gekauft in Japan (Kobe) als Bundle von ner Privatperson - 20.000 Yen\n\n\\- Primal Kyogre - Gekauft in Japan für 5460 (Yokohama, war ein kleiner Shop) Yen (33€) - happy und stolzer besitzer der schlechtesten Primal Kyogre in BGS :D\n\n\\- Blaine's Charizard, gecracked aus einem PGS Slab (war eine 8)\n\n\\- Gyarados Top Sun, keine Ahnung warum das nicht gegraded wurde, bin ich gerade im Austausch mit dem Support (hat eine Pop 1, sollte eigentlich gegraded werden)\n\n  \nDie Slabs von PGS und AOG habe ich zum Review eingeschickt, vermutlich breche ich die jetzt auf und schicke sie noch einmal ein. Meiner Meinung nach sollte man nicht für ein Review bezahlen, zumindest das Alakazam und das Pikachu hat meiner Meinung nach ein sehr faires Grade.

The people in line were awesome, at one point the target in the same plaza opened and we saw people going in and coming out with blooming waters boxes so we all took turns going over there and getting one. The target had DRI packs and 3 pack blisters, got some of those too and most of us ripped those packs on the gamestop sidewalk. There was a family with 4 kids and all the kids were so stoked to watch everyone else open their packs. One person brought sleeves and toploaders and someone pulled an SIR an they whipped them out of their bag to give to the person who hit. Hanging with a bunch of pokemon nerds helps kill the time, the dad of those kids has an insane collection he was showing off and one of the people in line vends at card shows.\n\n\n\nThe manager of the gamestop came out and told us she was actually off today but needed to make sure things went smoothly, she went down the line and asked each person what they were getting and gave us stickers for those products, so there would be no late cuts in line or anything like that. There was also an empty chair that was second in line that she said didnt count. too bad! after she distributed the stickers she went and enjoyed her day off.\n\n\nOnce the store opened everything was smooth and orderly. One of the 4 kids kept asking to see everyones promo so he could judge condition and centering lmao.\n\nI got home and my PC ETB and walmart DRI preorder had just been delivered. \n\nI generally hate whatnot, but Deep Pocket Monster did a stream yesterday with flash sales to get packs below MSRP plus if you used his referral code you got a $15 credit, so I got 6 packs for $24 with taxes and shipping. The stream was also really entertaining and he gave away a ton of shit. \n\n\nAll in all it just felt like yesterday was such an event, I had a lot of fun and havent even dug into my booster box yet.

    "text": "So I had this interesting situation come up on TCGPlayer recently. I ordered 3 QCSR Emergency Teleport from a seller in April for around $11 each. The expected arrival date came without receiving them, so I messaged seller asking if they had a tracking number (as they should for an order above $30 IMO.) They said they didn’t but offered right off to send me 3 new copies if I still wanted them. I did, so I said that would be fine. Since they offered this right off, I suspected they forgot to send the cards—but whatever. \n\nA couple weeks later, still no cards and still no tracking so I opened a case with TCGPlayer before it got too far past the order date where I was able to do so. But I messaged the seller and told them that if the cards ended up still showing up, I would reverse the refund (because I try to be an honest guy). Seller doesn’t respond so I go ahead and just buy another Playset from someone else.\n\nNow today (9 days after I opened the case) the cards do arrive—but I see they weren’t post-marked until 2 days AFTER I messaged the seller telling them I would reverse the refund if the cards still arrived. So clearly they finally only sent the cards after I opened the case—so they could force a sale—after they failed to send the cards either of the previous two times they were supposed to. \n\nI obviously don’t need the cards anymore. I said I’d reverse the refund—but now I’m just extremely frustrated with how the seller handled this, both by never using a tracking number and by only sending the cards after I opened a case and didn’t need the cards anymore. \n\nWould you go ahead and reverse the refund? Would you send the cards back? Negative feedback? Neutral feedback? Some other option? I don’t want my own irritation keep me from being reasonable here.",

It sold on Friday, April 25th and it is Monday, May 5th and I am still getting the notice under the card that says “Awaiting Payment From Buyer”. I looked it up and it says that the buyer has to pay within 7 days or it can be re-listed but it’s already been longer than 7 days. Something makes me think this is something on PSAs end not updating their orders or the app but I’m not sure. Anyone run into this issue before?

Just trying to figure out which grading company would bring the best ROI or appeal if I decide to move it.\n\nWhat would you do — PSA or Beckett?

    "text": "I have always been super into organizing and watching prices of Magic Bulk ever since I started playing as a kid in 2012ish. I finally decided to take the plunge a few months ago and bought a bunch of bulk cards to start a store on TCGPlayer. The main hurdle is really sourcing the cards and figuring out your storage and organization processes. I initially tried my hand/failed at finding hidden gem lots on EBay (the site changed a lot since I was kid haha). It feels like newer sellers don't have an advantage when selling/sourcing higher value cards as game stores can source them at way better margins.\n\nI was honestly about to quit before I stumbled on u/Damiencbw's posts on here about selling lower priced cards in bulk. I had picked up around 18k cards at admittedly a bad rate (3-4 cents a card) and sorted out all the cards above 10 cents. As a by day accountant who reconciles everything, I organized everything by set if sellable and any cards I wanted to hold in Manabox. I have so far listed 4,744 cards in my TCGPlayer inventory and around 4,300 in Manabox. I initially listed some of my own pricier collection at low prices to get the initial sales to move up the TCGPlayer levels. You really need to get to level 3 (11 completed sales) and then you can list to your heart's content (50k max listings).\n\nI learned a lot about the shipping and pricing strategy during this first month or two. I'll link the video I think I found on Reddit about the packing method I mostly follow. Getting in the rhythm of packing and listing is super important to build up stock and reputation. Since I am newer, I had set my shipping to around $1.36 to get higher volume (I plan to increase later). I cannot emphasize enough that having a higher shipping rate + minimum card price is crucial. You never want any potential orders to have zero or negative profit.\n\nAn order packing guide I roughly follow - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2cybvXQ1Kw&t=287s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2cybvXQ1Kw&t=287s)\n\n  \nSome things I learned that I didn't find online. I hope these can help fellow newbies who search Google - \n\n1. Buy windowed envelopes in bulk, TCGPlayer's orders can be folded to show address to save sooo much time\n2. Buy a customized address stamp off of amazon (20 bucks) if you want to move a lot of orders\n3. I use the BCW Monster 5k's and their card dividers for storage/organization\n4. Local game stores and used video game stores are the better sources for decent bulk\n5. Track your revenue with cash basis accounting because you will need to file taxes\n6. I personally sort out draft chaff and stuff them in orders as freebies to free up space\n7. I pack orders with TopLoaders (3x4in) + Team Bags (3x5in) + Printed Order Slip\n8. Listing a bunch of cards/starting is initially not profitable so don't be discouraged\n9. Only start up if you love sorting and have the patience to list for hours on end\n\n",

    "text": "(Originally tried to post this in main sub, and auto mod flagged it due to \"opening\" in the title 😖 but it's very relevant here too)\n\nI am an English-speaking Magic player in the USA who happens to love and collect higher-end non-English foils, like Japanese, etc.\n\nI am *very much* in the minority of the playerbase here, and that's why I feel qualified to address an issue I've seen and the clear negative results for most.\n\nTarkir Dragonstorm solidified a pretty clear problem that needs to be addressed quickly - putting chase cards in English packs that can be found in English and Japanese languages, without the Japanese version having unique art (like Strixhaven), is a *major feel bad* for most players on several levels. \n\nAt one major store I spent a lot of time at during Prerelease and Release weekends, I personally opened or saw the following be opened:\n\n2x Japanese Halo foil Clarion Conqueror\n\nJapanese Showcase foil Ugin\n\nJapanese Showcase foil Elspeth\n\nJapanese Showcase foil Clarion Conqueror\n\nJapanese Showcase foil Craterhoof Behemoth\n\n\nIn most cases, players would be absolutely thrilled to open chase cards like this, but then the reality hits:\n\n1) They can't read the card. Using it in tournaments or competitive games is unnecessarily difficult. \n\n2) They look up the price, get excited for a moment, but then realize that the price showing on TCGPlayer is English - they then filter to Japanese, and discover that the Japanese price is in most cases less than 50% of the English version. Now they feel bad, or even robbed of their good pull -\n\nHere's the English vs. Japanese prices of the cards I listed above: \n\n2x Japanese Halo foil Clarion Conqueror $240 EN, $65 JP - 27% of EN \n\nJapanese Showcase foil Ugin $150 EN, $65 JP - 43% of EN \n\nJapanese Showcase foil Elspeth $85 EN, $43 JP - 50% of EN \n\nJapanese Showcase foil Clarion Conqueror $26 EN, $8(!) JP - 30% of EN \n\nJapanese Showcase foil Craterhoof Behemoth $40 EN, $20 JP - 50% of EN\n\n\n3) So, if they decide they don't want it, and try to sell or buylist the card... Well, because they're just language variants and not unique art... vendors, stores, and buylists mostly just don't want them except in specific circumstances - like the Japanese Halo foil Ugin, for example. \n\nSo now, the player is stuck with a (very beautiful) card, that they may not be able to read, that they face unnecessary difficulty in selling ( and I can tell you from selling on TCGPlayer that non-English cards by comparison move *extremely slowly* ) looking over at someone else who pulled an English version with growing frustration and resentment.\n\n\nI came across more than a few people with this exact same situation in the last couple of weeks, and I traded for some of their cards, because I collect them - but I'm not representative of a typical player.\n\n\nThe *typical player* is likely unhappy with a Japanese pull - and Wizards needs to fix that ASAP, in honestly one of two ways - by either 1) removing the Japanese cards from English packs, or 2) giving them unique art. Otherwise, it's an unnecessary frustration to customers that may well discourage them from opening more packs! ☹️",

    "text": "To start with: \n\nWhat is my qualification to talk on this subject? Especially when it comes to recommending checking potentially multi thousand dollar items. \n\nI am a large collector with over 750,000 cards valued in the mid seven figures. This collection ranges from MTG, Pokemon, to Yu-Gi-Ho and sports cards. I have many complete sets (including all variants, holo, alt art exc) of Becket and CGC 10 pristine, as well as PSA 10 cards. I get a 10 pristine from becket 9/10 times when I send my cards in, in this tutorial I’ll explain how you can identify and choose which cards to get graded. \n\n(This tutorial **will not** go over value of cards to card, only how to identify if it is worth grading from a value perspective) \n\nFirst, recommended equipment:\n\n- two lamps at 1600 lumen. \n\n- head worn magnifying glass up to 10x. (I use YOCTOSUN LED Headband Magnifier up to 14x , $30 on Amazon. I recommend not to buy expensive ones not really worth it. \n\n-  Large desk magnifying glass up to 3x, got mine on Amazon for $45. \n\n- a new large mouse pad, or play mat and a sealed container for it. (Keep it in a clean area do not use the one you use with your mouse or play with. Learned that the hardway scratched a $400 card on a very small spec of dirt.)\n\n- micro fiber cloths, a lot of them. Anytime you leave and come back always use a new one. Or use a new one every time you look at a card over $100 is best practice to avoid accidents.\n\n- micro fiber or latex gloves (sounds stupid but you will be dinged as your skins oil can tarnish the card. Take a cheap common energy and squeeze it between your fingers and go along the edges then look under a 3x magnifying glass. You will see the oil residue. \n\n-card alignment checker. (On Amazon, for checking your boarder centering)\n\nTotal for set up: under $100 expensive doesn’t mean better. \n\nLighting: have one lamp on the right side looking down at a 45 degree angle, left side the same, both lights pointing at the same spot on the mat. Mat is to protect the card, use a mat if you want a high grade. \n\nNow that we have our equipment, and lighting. We will go over order of operations.\n\nOrder: front card centering, front edges, front corners, front face, back card centering, back edges, back corners, back face. \n\nUse the alignment tool check specs within 55/45 to 60-40 for PSA 10. For Beckett and CGC 10 pristine it has to have 50/50 all around front, 60/40 on rear. (Hence why they are far more valuable than a PSA) \nRemember every beckett 10 is a PSA 10, but not every PSA10 is a Beckett 10.\n\nWhen checking edges, and corners look for ripples, or “snags” you are looking for white when should be color of the art or border. A perfect edge should be as straight as a razor and completely uniform. Anything not uniform is a fail. For corners you are looking for straight cuts (eliminate the candidate if it has a straight cut in the corner) , and if the corner is rounded properly. If it’s roughly to correct shape but it has a very small hang from a dull blade that’s fine for a normal 10 not a pristine, that one would be advised to send to PSA. The main shape and consistency is what’s important on corners. So if all corners are slightly off, but all the same way it will get a higher grade than if it’s just one corner due to consistency.\n\nWhen checking surfaces tilt the card in the light. Check its entire area for pits, scratches , and Blemishes. If you ask yourself is (this) okay? Then it will almost certainly not get a pristine 10. If it has a single minor scratch, perfect otherwise it’ll usually get a 9 to 9.5. \n\nOnce you have checked both sides, and it looks good enough for what you want, minor scratches and blemishes you can expect 7-9, any surface pits are a automatic max 6 even if card is perfect other wise, ripple on edge do to dull blade is usually 7-8. Small Ding in a corner .25mm - .1mm is a 9-9.5. Ding over that will drastically decrease grade depending on grader. Maximum of an 8 from my samples. Pro tip, don’t grade under $10 cards unless it is mint +. A PSA 7-8 on a )\n$10 card is hard to move. A PSA 10, or\nBeckett, CGC 10 pristine is as easy as breathing to liquidate. \nI also don’t want to mince words, PSA 10 is the most valuable 10, but Beckett and CGC 10 pristines (chase grade) are far more valuable to most high end collectors. Where as a CGC 10 Is less valuable than beckett 10 which is less than a PSA 10 on average (the rule not the exception) \n\nTips and advice for collections and future grading purposes. Best practice when opening packs, penny sleeve everything until you know what’s valuable or speculate might be valuable in the future. You can get 10k sleeves for $50 on Amazon. I do that to keep my collection mint, and for resale value. A common graded at Beckett 10 pristine from 30 years ago is worth a heck of a lot more than one that is not. Think about the future and take care of not just your expensive cards but also your “cheap cards” and your future self in 30-40 years will thank you. Speaking form experience on what I wish I did better. Have a alpha black lotus that’s a 7.5 worth about $65,000. It could’ve been the only 10 pristine in existence which would go well over a million. I pulled it, pack fresh it has perfect corners, edges and centering. Only thing is I played it and did not sleeve it until months later. \n\nTLDR Parents, teach your kids to take care of their cards (mine didnt). And if you buy them boosters buy them the sleeves to go with them. Also grade your cards you want to preserve regardless of shape. I have my first cards from my first booster graded at a PSA 1 (lol) to PSA 9 because it’s valuable to me. Grading isn’t just about money, it’s about preserving the cards.",

I mostly was just observing and I was astonished at how these streamers act. “We gotta go chat” “I paid way more than that chat” “you’re robbing me chat” (??) After about a hour between 2-3 streams I was pretty much set on never opening the app again. The one that did me in was a streamer selling a 2024 Allen and Ginter base mini Jackson Chourrio and was overly pissed at the chat that it sold for “only” $6. Blatantly lying to the buyer that they “printed money” on overpaying on a base card (last sold for a $1.49 a few days ago on eBay) Not to mention one streamer was adding Wander Franco cards randomly to auctions for no reason. Do people enjoy Fanatics Live? Is there anything better than this? Is this a common experience?? ",

Should have researched that first which was stupid. \n\n  \nIn any case - my card is being shipped there, did I screw myself or is this something I can easily have re-shipped to my address? On ownership - will I have to prove to them I am the owner? \n\n  \nIt looked like sellers use it to store and re sell their cards, but the section on withdrawing a card you own was blank - and since I wasn't the person who shipped the card to begin with, I am just a bit nervous i screwed up. \n\n  \nAnybody deal with this before / know what best course of action is? (I'll contact their support of course, I just read a lot of complaints about their CS so I wanted to post here as well in case I can get a quick answer for peace of mind)",

The lowest rate is 7% for a $5000+ sale, and the highest rate is 16% (minimum $5) for an under $100 sale.\n\nFrom what I can tell, the fees for higher cost cards seem very competitive. At least cards that would sell at $1000+. Cheaper than eBay fees, or other 3rd party consignor fees. It's also cheaper than fees on other vault sites like fanatics collect or onlyalt for example.\n\nPSA Vault also offers Goldin rates but it seems a lot higher. Under $7500 sale price on Goldin (through PSA Vault) says they take the full buyers premium of 20% from the hammer price.\n\n\n\nBesides the 7%-16% fee, is there anything else to consider here in terms of fees/costs?\n\nWhy would anyone want to sell through Goldin over eBay when the fees are higher on Goldin regardless of sales price? I'm assuming Goldin gets a large audience of wealthy bidders maybe? But thought I should ask before making assumptions",

We get it back today and it’s slabbed and says “authentic altered”. We’re so mad that we paid $100+ to have this card graded, but also that our son’s card isn’t actually graded and that they think it was altered in some way… which it definitely wasn’t. There was no note on the paper that said why or how they think it was altered, but a circle on the note of the back top corner? I’m wondering wtf is even going on because this doesn’t make sense to us and we don’t even know what they think we did to the card? I’ve attached pictures and hopefully someone can give us some insight or maybe it happened to you. \n\nWe had another issue a couple weeks back when my husband sent a pikachu with a wizards of the coast stamp, that he pulled when he was a kid… and they said the stamp was inconclusive.
