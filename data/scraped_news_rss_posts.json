    "text": "Top 5 rookie pitcher chases in 2026 Topps Series 1 Baseball\n\nLast week we ran through the top hitter chases in 2026 Topps Series 1 Baseball, and while the top end chases for hitters are indeed top tier, the class lacked a touch of depth. It wasn’t immensely difficult to narrow it down to a top five list. That is not the case for the pitcher list, however. There is top flight pitching talent up and down this check list and a few guys had to be left off this list that could be potential superstars somewhere down the line. Honorable Mentions Jonah Tong and Payton Tolle I’ll start with the two that would be ranked sixth and seventh here. Both of these players debuted last season, and while both struggled, there is no reason to give up on either of these guys yet. If anything, their early career struggles might make it a good time to get some stock in both these guys, getting ahead of the turnaround that should come for both of them. Tong really struggled in a limited sample, and as a Mets fan myself, it was pretty clear he just wasn’t ready to come up just yet, especially in the middle of a playoff race with a ton of pressure to save the season. He posted an ERA of 7.71 in just 18.2 innings pitched, most of which is ballooned from a really rough outing against the Texas Rangers where he gave up six runs while only recording two outs. The one positive for Tong is that he did still strike out 22 batters in those 18.2 innings, showing a little bit of the potential. He’s only 22 years old, turning 23 in June, so he has plenty of time and there is no cause for concern for him. He just needs a little bit more time in the oven and should be starting the season at AAA. Payton Tolle’s story is about the same as Tong’s. He had an ERA of 6.06 in 16.1 innings pitched, and while he didn’t have the same true blow up start like Tong did, he just really struggled to find his footing. He got moved to a relief role down the stretch, which didn’t go too much better for him. He is also only 23 years old, and like Tong as well, he struck out 19 batters in those 16.1 innings, also showing the potential that the Red Sox are looking for. Like Tong, Tolle is a hold but there is a lot of upside to like with both these pitchers, and in weaker years of pitcher chases, these two, even with these results, they would still find themselves as the top chases in a rookie pitcher class. Bubba Chandler The second overall prospect for the Pittsburgh Pirates, only behind potential future superstar Konnor Griffin, Chandler also debuted toward the end of 2025 and had more success than Tong and Tolle. In 31.1 innings, Chandler struck out 31 batters to an ERA of 4.02 but that doesn’t really tell the full story. With a WHIP of 0.926 and a FIP of 2.66, there are a lot of signs that Chandler performed better than even the respectable 4.04 ERA would indicate. Chandler has the perk of not having to be a true ace right away as well, considering he will be pitching behind Paul Skenes, though the ne...",

    "text": "Top 5 hitters to chase in 2026 Topps Series 1 Baseball\n\nThe release of Series 1 baseball, which happens to be this coming Wednesday, Feb. 11, is always a fun one to mark on the calendar. It is one of, if not the most iconic set releases across all of the hobby. It checks all the boxes of awesome looking inserts, fun auto chases, and of course the entire new class of rookies to hunt after. And this year’s iteration of Series 1 has quite the lengthy list of rookies to go after, so many in fact that this is actually going to be a two-part series on what rookies to chase. We’re going to start with the guys at the dish. While the list of hitters to chase isn’t quite as deep as the guys on the mound, there are still some truly dynamic bats that collectors are going to be eager to get their hands on. Jakob Marsee Marsee is the most intriguing one on this list because he’s the one that didn’t have a very high pedigree when he was drafted. Originally a sixth round pick by the Padres in the 2022 MLB Draft, he was sent to the Marlins in exchange for Luis Arraez in May of 2024 and became as high as the 12th prospect in the Marlins’ system before debuting in 2025. While he only played 55 games in his rookie campaign as a 24-year-old, Marsee showed immense promise. He was able to accrue nearly 2 bWAR in those 55 games, with an OPS of .842 and showed some strong ability in the field in that limited sample size. His underlying numbers are impressive too, particularly his strong plate discipline, chasing pitches only 19.9% of the time and swinging and missing only 19.5% of the time. While not coming up as the most exciting prospect, Marsee is certainly someone to keep eyes on entering 2026 and given the state of the rest of the Marlins’ outfield, he should be given a pretty long runway to prove he’s the real deal. Jac Caglianone The Major League debut of Jac Caglianone didn’t go quite as anticipated, but it is by no means abnormal for an eventually great player to struggle out of the gate. There is no need to look further than guys like Mike Trout or Aaron Judge, who faced similar challenges upon their debut, with Judge even being called up at an older age than Caglianone was last year. There isn’t much of a cause for concern for Caglianone, and he’s still going to be one of the premier chases of Series 1. He showed truly elite bat speed in his limited sample size and that is a good sign to be able to turn things around. His strikeout rate and walk rate were also around league average, showing that it maybe wasn’t all quite as bad as it seemed. And again, it is hard to judge a 22-year-old off of 232 plate appearances. The Royals could choose to be patient with him this season, letting him develop more in the minor leagues, however given the barren state of their outfield, there could be some pressure on the team to let him work through his struggles on the Major League roster. Kyle Teel Playing catcher at a Major League level at the age of 23 is not something man...",

    "text": "Five best looking Special Illustration Rares in Ascended Heroes\n\nAscended Heroes is the newest Pokemon set to hit shelves and the most unique thing about it is the number of Special Illustration Rares in the set. Coming in at a total of 22 SIRs, that makes for the highest number of SIRs we’ve seen in a set in the, albeit brief, Mega Evolutions era. In fact, Mega Evolution and Phantasmal Flames have a combined total of 15 SIRs, making Ascended Heroes a particularly great set to chase them. The sheer number of SIRs also makes for a fun opportunity for me, as I typically focus on a set’s Illustration Rares because the quantity of SIRs doesn’t typically allow for a ranking with any kind of selection. Ascended Heroes deviates from that trend and it is incredibly exciting to see such a wide scope of premium hits. Fezandipiti ex Fezandipiti isn’t one of my favorite Pokemon, and that would likely be the common sentiment among most fans. Of the Loyal Three of Fezandipiti, Okidogi, and Munkidori, Fezandipiti is the one I am most drawn to, and all three of them do have some really nice arts. This Fezandipit is the best among them, taking a bit of inspiration from the Munkidori Illustration Rare from Shrouded Fable. The influx of pink color brought by both Fezandipiti itself and the cherry blossom tree complement each other well, making for an overall beautiful piece of artwork. Mega Frosslass ex Froslass is inspired by Japanese folklore of a spirit haunting the woods waiting for weary travelers to wander through and this Mega Froslass ex SIR encompasses that piece of folklore. The way it stands between the trees, with an enticing, yet sinister, look makes you know the fate of the traveler that finds this Pokemon. Snow aesthetic is always going to get bonus points for me as it is. Mega Gengar ex Mega Gengar is one of the coolest megas solely based on the fact of how terrifying it is. For as haunting as regular Gengar is supposed to be, there is something usually comedic about its appearance but that comedic element goes away when it comes to Mega Gengar. This Mega Gengar ex SIR uses a pretty wonderful blend of darker color, and in a set where most of the cards use brighter colors, the dark colors really pop, especially with the green plasma at the forefront of the card. The orange in the back also makes it look like it’s on some kind of path of destruction. It probably is. Pikachu ex The Pikachu ex SIR makes you feel like you’ve just started your Pokemon journey and have set off into Viridian Forest and have just found this wild Pikachu. It stares at you, with a mix of wariness and intrigue as you prepare to attempt to catch it. The sunlight shining down on it giving it the spotlight effect is fitting, given that PIkachu is always in the spotlight. Pikachu is always at its best when it’s at its cutest and this thing is adorable. What an excellent art for the most iconic Pokemon. Mega Dragonite ex One of the most desirable cards in the set is also the best lo...",
