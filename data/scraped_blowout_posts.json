Then 24ish hours later I received an email from them asking me to pay them via PayPal or a Bank Wire Transfer. That once I did that, they’d refund my credit card. It’s not an international order. Obviously I’m not falling for the Nigerian Prince scheme but wondering if anyone else has run into this. I have attempted to contact them but no reply to email and no phone number to call. Thanks!",

    "text": "Evening all, a little history, married for almost 24 years, 2 kids, one early 20s and one late teens. We've had our share of ups and downs over the years, like any married couple will, we've worked through them for the most part. The last 5 years have been the most turbulent with setting boundaries and her families influence on her decision making. I make pretty good money, about 200k annually between salary and commission and have worked IT for almost 20 years. I'm the breadwinner, she has a small side business she makes about 15k a year at.\n\nMy goal is to layout a pattern of behavior I'm seeing. 8 years ago i sold a business for 20k, and for a long time we've been putting 2k/monthly into a savings account, with the expectation to grow that account, pay off debts, enjoy life type stuff. She pays the bills, i make the money. During the pandemic i noticed a sharp increase in credit card spending by her, we eventually paid it off but it frustrated me that she did that, we fought about it and used some savings to pay it off. About 3 years ago, there was another uptick in credit card spending, but since the savings had been drained from the first round, she convinced me to get a HELOC to pay off the debt, and we did.\n\nAbout a year ago now, i noticed another uptick in credit card spending and this time we took out a personal loan to pay it off. So if you're tracking, 30k+ in savings wiped out, 40k HELOC and 35K personal loan to pay off debts. About the same time as the personal loan, her brother started going to a local casino, he's shy and my wife, his sister will often go with him so he doesn't go alone, he's single and still lives at home with their parents, he's 40, not really relevant beyond that.\n\nI am currently studying for an IT exam I'd like take, and I was looking up training options and found one that was reasonably priced for the exam i want to take. I logged into a small savings account i have and was shocked to see that there was only 600 in the account versus the 2k that should be in there. I started looking at the transaction history and saw that there were several 2-4 hundred dollar withdrawals from ATMs at casinos in our area and areas that I travel to for work, she sometimes comes with me.\n\nIm an engineer, i analyze stuff for a living and propose solutions, so i started digging, over the past 10 years of making 100k+ annually and side businesses that i've gotten involved in, i have calculated that 150k has been spent by her that could've been saved. An example, i used to earn royalties on content i created and would get paid quarterly, we weren't smart about the money  back then, so it would get deposited into our main checking account and within a short period of time, it was gone. I am to blame for a lot of it, so i've put measures in place to prevent that, like multiple back accounts and direct deposit routing to keep the money organized.\n\nMy frustration is 2 pronged, this recent fascination with casinos and finding that several hundred dollars from a savings account are missing. I discovered this a few days ago and have been gathering evidence ever since. This isn't the first time i've discovered unusual spending that isn't needed, not the first time i've considered leaving because of the spending, and not the first time i've struggled with not being able to control her financially. Back in 2021-2022, we had a really bad blowout, weren't talking at all, started talking to lawyers but she realized i wasn't playing around and love bombed me to stay, promised she'd change, anyone that's been together this long, has a family and are well integrated, it's not easy.\n\nIm not sure why, but this time it feels different, discovering the money missing and not blowing up over it, like i shouldn't be surprised, her pattern of behavior with money strikes again. I confided in a buddy of mine, we work together, good dude, told him the situation, answered his questions, he asked me if I still love her, I said no, im to the point now where i don't want to be in the same room as her, im still civil with her, i don't argue or yell. He thinks i should consult a divorce lawyer and walk away. I started looking things up, no-fault state and 50/50 division of marital property. I'd end up paying child support for a little while, and alimony for the rest of my life, more than likely. But it does give me the peace of mind that she doesn't have access to my money any more and i'd be in control.\n\nI was really tempted this morning after some work stuff, at the kitchen table, sit down and tell her i want a divorce, im done, don't try to convince me otherwise. I decided not to do that since our sons birthday is coming up in april, i think that'll give me time to look into what it will cost to move out and get myself situated. I don't want to pull the divorce trigger before his birthday, i don't want to ruin his birthday, he's looking forward to it. I've started researching divorce lawyers in my area, and getting an idea of child support/alimony payments. It won't be cheap by any means but as my buddy said, you'll have peace of mind knowing she's not bleeding you dry.\n\nAccording to research, debt accrued through the marriage is split down the middle, and i'll likely be strapped with it. I will likely also have to pay for her to live in the home we share currently. I've also read that sometimes the courts force the sale of the home to settle the debt, there is enough equity in the home to do that, it would get paid off and likely some left over. I'm not sure how that will work, i know a lawyer will be able to provide insight on that. My thought is to talk to a lawyer about the divorce, weigh my options and after our sons birthday, have her served with papers and move out.\n\nThe last time we went through this, i told her it would be easier if she just cheated on me, i could just walk away and not battle with myself on trying to fix the financial situation im in. I know it's a dumb way of looking at it, but the line would be easier to cross. She's been sending me videos about missing me and feeling disconnected, i am 100% pulling away, i've got to figure out how to break it to her that Im done, and my own advice is to just tell her when no one is around. There is no easy way to rip that band aid off, you just gotta do it. A coworker of mine just finished a divorce and she told me that telling her ex lifted the burden off her shoulders, she felt freed, it sucked going through the divorce, but she's happy she did it.\n\nedit1: There is somethings i forgot to add last night, i was tired, about a month ago, she went with me to a customer meeting in our area, we drove, she dropped me off and we had discussed her driving north about 15 minutes to shop around, the meeting was scheduled for 2 hours but ended up only going 90 minutes. I texted her that we were wrapping up and about 10 minutes later, an hour and 40 minutes total meeting time, i checked her location and she was flying down the interstate on her way back from a city 30 minutes away. I was instantly pissed, there was only one reason for her to go there, casino. \n\nI ended up waiting 27 minutes for her to arrive, when she did, i opened the door and asked, \"where the hell were you?\". She said she went shopping and said BS, i checked your location, you were coming back from the casino. She said, I'm only 7 minutes late, stop being so dramatic. I told you the meeting would likely end early, which it did, and I had to sit in their lobby for almost a half hour for you to show back up, that is not cool at all. We drove home in silence after that. Later that night, during dinner, it was very icy, I asked her how much she won, it was over a grand. She started telling me how she won it, I said I don't care, when did you decide to take off to the casino, we never discussed it. She said, right after i dropped you off, i googled it, hour round trip, hour there, back in time for you. I said no, you weren't i told you to stay close, and you took off on me. I can't trust you with basic things. From now on, you're not coming with me on meetings unless its over night, and i will be dropping you off and picking you up. \n\nI found out later on that week that she had told everyone, family and friends how i overreacted. I confronted her, i was like why is it when i have an issue with you doing something, you think it's a joke and dismiss it? She said cuz i was only 7 minutes late, its not a big deal. I said, ok, you win, im not gonna fight you on this since you don't see how upsetting this is to me, and no matter how i explain it, you dismiss it, that's not cool. Since then, about a month or so ago, things have been tense, and then i find the missing money. \n\nThis past weekend is when i found the missing money transactions, we took a trip 5 hours away for work, stayed overnight. We went out to dinner and during dinner, the conversation was that of a very awkward first date, not much said, barely looking at each other, we ate in silence. I did ask her how she wanted to handle some recent discipline issues with our youngest son, and we disagreed on how to handle that. I told her i was open to discussing it and figure it out, she shutdown and stayed quiet for the remainder of dinner. We eventually paid the bill and as we were walking back to our room, she asked verbatim \"so are we going to fuck or what?\" I said, if you'd like to, we can, she said she wanted to. So we did, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either, more just going through the motions. The next day, we get home, and during the drive, we continued to disagree on things. We stopped for dinner before getting home, her brother met us there, and she went with him to the local casino, she claims she had free play that she was going to let him use and then they'd be out. I said, ok, and i finished the drive home by myself. \n\nAbout an hour later, get home, unpack from the trip, and head to my office to work on stuff, she comes home and comes into my office, locks the door and says she's going to take care of me. The house was bustling, both kids are home, with friends over, her folks, so I'm like now? She didn't answer me, just dropped to her knees and started going to work. About 15 minutes later she finished, didn't spit it out, and looked at me while doing it. She got up, kissed me on the cheek, said she loved me and would leave me alone. That was Monday night, figured i would fill in some of the most recent info for context that i forgot last night. ",

    "text": "#Countdown to Kickoff 2026: FC Dallas\n\n----\n\n**Welcome to FC Dallas's entry in the Countdown to Kickoff!**\n\nThe streak continues for lucky 13 this year! Absurd to think that I first wrote the /r/MLS preview for FC Dallas in 2014 and haven't missed a year since. \n\nAs is tradition, this is late. Hella late. ~~Two~~ ~~three~~ ~~eight~~ ~~nine~~ ***ten*** days late, to be exact. Once again, life and work and mental health and an RSI flareup in my left wrist and other very pleasant things got in the way of starting this when I wanted to, but that's honestly fairly routine at this point.\n\nBut keeping with the other traditions, a little look backwards. The first one of these I wrote was for the 2014 season, when I was 19. It went up on 22 Feb, 2014.\n\nIn 2014, we only had 52 professional teams across men's and women's leagues throughout the pyramid. We had MLS, NASL, and USL Pro, and for women's, the NWSL in its second season.\n\nBack then, /r/MLS had 18,575 subscribers and MLS had 19 teams. Chivas USA were beginning what would be their final season. LA Galaxy launched Galaxy 2 in USL Pro, beginning the MLS professional second team era. Sacramento Republic FC made their debut and went on to win the USL Pro Championship over Harrisburg City Islanders (RIP).\n\nFor the 2026 season, oh my god, what a change! /r/MLS is over 970k subscribers (more than 50x bigger!), and we have an incredible 128 professional teams, more than double!\n\nIt's been amazing watching this league, and this community, grow exponentially since then, spreading soccer to more and more places and people. If you're reading this, I'm glad you're here! And maybe someday, you'll be writing one of these posts yourself, for a team that doesn't yet exist.\n\nLet's get into it.\n\n----\n\n#Basic info: \n\n**Full club name:** FC Dallas (formerly Dallas Burn)  \n**Subreddit:** /r/FCDallas  \n**Location:** Frisco, Texas ([Stadium Location](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Dallas,+TX/Frisco,+TX/@32.9602789,-96.9713383,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x864c19f77b45974b:0xb9ec9ba4f647678f!2m2!1d-96.7969879!2d32.7766642!1m5!1m1!1s0x864c3c1abc09943d:0xcad371b035c8fea2!2m2!1d-96.8236116!2d33.1506744!3e0))  \n**Stadium:** [Toyota Stadium, ~~19,096~~ ~11,000 thru 2027](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Dallas_Stadium)  \n**Head Coach:** [Eric Quill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Quill) (2nd season)  \n**Captain:** [Shaq Moore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaq_Moore) (so far in pre-season)  \n**Owner:** Hunt Sports Group, chairman Clark Hunt  \n**President:** Dan Hunt  \n**Reserve Team:** [North Texas SC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Texas_SC)\n\n**Kits:**\n\n* Primary: [2026-2027 \"DNA\"](https://www.fcdallas.com/dna)\n* Secondary: [2025-2026 \"Inferno\"](https://www.fcdallas.com/inferno)\n\n**Jersey Sponsor:** [UT Southwestern/Children's Health](https://www.fcdallas.com/news/fc-dallas-introduces-children-s-health-and-ut-southwestern-as-official-health-ca)\n\n**Trophies:**\n\n* 1997 U.S. Open Cup\n* 2010 Western Conference Champions\n* 2016 U.S. Open Cup\n* 2016 Supporters Shield\n\n----\n\n#Rivalries:\n\n1. **Texas Derby vs Houston Dynamo** - The Texas Derby, the biggest rivalry in Texas bar none. Since San Jose's relocation to the Lone Star State in 2006 (and subsequent MLS Cup successes), the inherent hatred between the DFW Metroplex and Houston has only grown stronger in MLS. The two sides compete for \"El Capitán\", a [massive fucking Civil War-era Howitzer cannon](https://images.mlssoccer.com/image/private/t_editorial_landscape_12_desktop/f_auto/mls-dal-prd/bmx39ebeuiwntz2sacll.jpg) that's still fully operational. It's the coolest trophy in sports and I will tolerate no arguments to the contrary. For the first time since 2021, FC Dallas is not the holder of El Capitán, as Houston beat us for the first time since September 2021 back last March, and won the Derby with an away goal in Frisco. God damnit.\n\n2. **FC Dallas Fans vs [The Dallas North Tollway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_North_Tollway)** - Even though we completed our first ever sellout season last year, that damn tollway is still front of the mind. DFW, despite the reputation, actually has a competent, if not cromulent, public transit network that can get you from most parts of the Metroplex to the airport, downtown in either city, up to my city of Denton, wherever you need to go - except for Frisco and Arlington. Infuriating. So instead we must drive, and not only drive, but pay for the privilege of the one major road to the stadium.\n\n3. **Copa Tejas** - Another complicated story, of a new Texan MLS team with a dubious, relocation-related origin story. Austin got their team, and leapfrogged San Antonio in the process, with a sizeable deal of questionable conduct from Precourt Sports Ventures. Fortunately, San Antonio still survives in USLC, The Crew were saved, and now Texas has 3 MLS teams. Since the Texas Derby already has one team involving Californians relocating to Texas, a new trophy was created, based on the already existing USL Copa Tejas. Dallas won the inaugural one in 2021 and again in 2024 and finished 2nd behind the orange bastards last season.\n\n4. **FC Dallas vs Sporting KC, but specifically in the Open Cup** - Way back in 2004, Dallas first played Kansas City in the Open Cup, and Kansas City won 4-0. Fast-forward over a decade to 2015, and once again, Dallas drew Kansas City in the Open Cup. Kansas City once again won by 4, with a 6-2 final score. Since then, Dallas has faced Kansas City in the Open Cup four more times, in 2017, 2018, 2022, and 2024. Kansas City won all 4 games. In 2024, things were 1-1 into extra-time, before Dany Rosero became the last SKC player to end our cup run. Dallas has never beaten SKC in Open Cup play, ever, and I have no idea how or why it keeps happening.\n\n5. **Brimstone Cup vs Chicago Fire** - Back when MLS was young, Dallas was the Burn, and MLS had a Central Division, some passionate supporters created the Brimstone Cup, celebrating the legitimate animosity between Dallas and Chicago during the 2001 season and playoffs. Unfortunately, the following season, the Central Division was eliminated and Dallas and Chicago found themselves in separate conferences. Through 2011, the league managed to scheduled at least two matches between the sides, but for 2020 and 2021, there were none. 2022 brought it back to Soldier Field for the first time since 2005 in a 0-0 draw featuring 6 yellow cards. It returned for 2025, and Dallas got flattened 3-1 at home. No match for 2026, but mayhaps again for 2027, or maybe one of the midseason tournaments.\n\n6. **FC Dallas Fans vs FC Dallas Front Office** - The biggest year-round rivalry, FC Dallas fans have been questioning the decisions of The Powers That Hunt for as long as they've been involved with the team. Things have been more-or-less less overtly hostile lately, mainly due to the attempted big swing signings for 2025 (including Lucho Acosta, which, yeah, we're gonna talk about that), the ongoing stadium renovations, the unexpected playoff appearance last year, etc. In particular, ownership has gotten less of the heat compared to general manager Andre Zanotta, some of it completely justified. But still, it feels like compared to several years ago that the Hunts are actually, kinda, sorta, maybe, actually trying to put a good team and experience together. Now we're all waiting for the construction to end in another year and change.\n\n7. **Lamar Hunt Pioneer Cup vs Columbus Crew SC** - Less a true rivalry than a point of interesting MLS history, the Lamar Hunt Pioneer Cup celebrates two of the three teams Lamar Hunt owned before his passing in December of 2006. Lamar Hunt was a football man at heart (including founding the American Football League and creating the Super Bowl), but converted to soccer as the NASL came together, owning the Dallas Tornado for their entire existence. When MLS came together, he owned Columbus and Kansas City, paid for Columbus's first stadium in 1998 (MLS's first dedicated stadium), saved the league from collapse in 2001, and bought the struggling Dallas Burn in 2003. Under Uncle Lamar's stewardship, FC Dallas got its new name, its own stadium, and its now famous academy. If you're wondering why Dallas fans got so vitriolic during the \\#SaveTheCrew saga, now you know. Outside of MLS, he also helped bring the World Cup to the USA in 1994, and the entire Open Cup tournament is named in his honour. Thank you, Uncle Lamar.\n\n8. **The Rest** - At different points in time, Dallas has had rather substantial beefs with much of the Western Conference.

And genuinely optimistic. There's a lot to like about this roster, this coaching staff, and especially the \"new\" stadium gradually coming together. A new look FC Dallas for a very new looking MLS, just what we've wanted for years.\n\nHere's hoping I don't look stupid come August.\"\n\nThat's how I ended this piece last year. Welp.\n\n2025 was a tale of two stories for FC Dallas. Yes, the roster got a massive overhaul based around coup signing Lucho Acosta from FC Cincinnati to replace Velasco. Eric Quill, coach of the legendary 2019 North Texas SC team (that absolutely ran the table in the inaugural USL League 1 season), came back to Frisco to get the keys to the first team. And yes, for a little while, there were some very positive signs of life and change and happiness from this reworked squad.\n\nThe season began with a lovely second half comeback win in Houston, a classic barnburner duel in Commerce City, Colorado that ended 3-3, and a record of 4-3-3 through the first ten. There was rust, yes, but only one genuine howler result (a 1-3 home scorching in the Brimstone Cup), and a 4-3 road win against an albeit Messi-less Miami. 15 points in 10 isn't spectacular, but again, this looked like a reasonably sturdy foundation to build the rest of the season on, and importantly, FC Dallas was undefeated *on the road*. For a team that's historically mediocre away from home, that was a particularly shining achievement.\n\nLucho Acosta had chemistry with Petar Musa. Musa had Farrington as a strike partner. New centerback signing Osaze Urhoghide was providing back line stability approaching the levels last seen with Matt Hedges. Maarten Paes had it locked down in net. As long as the team made it through to August without the dreaded traditional FC Dallas Summer Slump, some midseason adjustments could have the team in playoff position.\n\nWell, about that.\n\nFC Dallas started off the month of May on the road in San Diego. Musa wasn't available with an ankle injury, and a few other players were with him on the injured list, but there was still something of a 1.25st string lineup available. Just go out there, keep that road momentum, and even if it's a draw, that's a road point.\n\nHow about instead, a penalty conceded in the 20th minute and Sebastian Ibeagha having one of the worst single match performances I've seen from any FC Dallas player in probably a decade. Ibeagha's showing meant that players kept having to drop out of position to cover for him, which only left more uncovered space, and San Diego punished to the tune of a 5-0 blowout.\n\nDallas had one brief highlight in the Open Cup the next week, but a 3-1 win against a USL1 side with a mostly-first-team lineup is not a major point to celebrate.\n\nFC Dallas didn't win again until June 14.\n\nOnly managing a 1-1 draw against an RSL side playing down a man for half an hour, 2-0 shutout against Houston, a road loss in Seattle, a failed comeback for Acosta's return to Cincy that ended 3-3, and a 0-0 home draw against Philly where Dallas played a man down for 51 minutes. And, Dallas got bounced in a shootout in the Open Cup against the Red Bulls. From undefeated on the road to incapable of salvaging in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe summer slump had arrived. \n\nThe thing is, June started out with a bit of a bright spot. Dallas managed to dismantle SKC 4-2 on the road (albeit with help from a red card, and it still looked a bit iffy), but then lost the next 4 in a row by a combined 11-5 margin. Worst of all, superstar signing Lucho Acosta was playing and acting and looking absolutely miserable, and it was affecting the rest of the roster. He found himself out of the starting lineup by the middle of July, which led to the most inexplicable thing: the team started playing *better* without him.\n\nThe big swing signing that made headlines in pre-season, the team captain, the focal point for a reconstructed lineup, was on the bench, and the team looked completely different *and for the better*.\n\nA 2-2 draw in San Jose, a massive 3-0 win at home against St Louis (first win in 6 games), a tough but perpetually close 3-4 loss at home to NYCFC, and FC Dallas had arrived in August looking very different to May. And Acosta? He was sent to Fluminense in Brazil after openly demanding out of Frisco.\n\nWith 10 left to play in the season, FC Dallas was well out of playoff contention, having won just *twice* in *fourteen goddamn games*, one of the most brutal summer slumps for a team already infamous for them. But, this is MLS, and anything can happen (and it usually does!), so maybe, just maybe, an Acosta-less FC Dallas could get things done.\n\nI don't think any of us expected FCD to go undefeated in the next 8. With 4 wins, And never being shutout. Despite injuries, despite needing to lean on inexperienced players, and even having to swap in Michael Collodi for Maarten Paes, the momentum never let up. To highlight but a single match from this run, let's look at September's road trip to St Louis. Starting keeper Collodi received a (questionable, imho) red card just 16 minutes in. Enter Jacob Jackson, playing his first MLS minutes in over a year, making his FC Dallas debut, and going in without a warm-up.\n\nAnd proceeds to put in the team's best single-game goalkeeper performance since 1998, and conceded just a single goal en route to a 1-1 draw. From a team that couldn't handle existing on the pitch together without conflict, to a team that could pull the impossible out of nowhere, in a matter of weeks.\n\nA 2-1 loss on the road in Carson (thanks to Farrington getting an early red) meant that to sneak into the playoffs, FC Dallas only had to win on the road in Vancouver. Against the team that, for my money, looked like the best overall team in MLS in 2025.\n\nYes, the red card to Laborda in the 11th helped. But this was a dominant Whitecaps side that won the Voyageurs, had made the CCC final, managed to shrug off everyone despite the most congested calendar of any MLS team.\n\nAnd FC Dallas put it away, 2-1. And finished 7th in the West, not just in the playoffs but avoiding the dreaded play-in round. And stopped the Whitecaps from winning the shield.\n\nVancouver dropped to 2nd in the conference from that result alone, a decision day miracle for the ages for North Texas, which meant that come playoff time, it was a guaranteed rematch. \n\nAt this point, two things were abundantly clear: Vancouver was out for blood, for glory, for their best chance at MLS Cup in their history. And FC Dallas was gassed.\n\nThe first game in Vancouver was a foregone conclusion. FC Dallas was out-shot 22 to 0 (yike!), only controlled the posession charts for around 5 minutes, and lost 3-0. Not even remotely close to being in the game. The return leg, somehow, found FC Dallas managing to (almost) go toe-to-toe with the Caps, holding a 1-0 lead for over 65 minutes, keeping a 1-1 draw through extra time, and only falling in a shootout.\n\nBut to go out on spot kicks against the best team in the league in the playoffs?\n\nNo way to spin this other than one of the best mid-season turnarounds in team history.\n\n----\n\n#Transfers Out:\n\n* **Antonio Carrera (GK) to Tigres UANL (MEX)** - Antonio Carrera signed as a homegrown player out of the FC Dallas academy, and had some nice highlights for the youth teams and with North Texas SC. But with depth at the first team, there wasn't much space for him on the roster. So, when Tigres came knocking, it was an easy decision for everyone involved. Hope the best for him.\n\n* **Show Cafumana (MF) to Maccabi Haifa** - Show was signed to be a major anchor 6, the sort of young, quick, collected defensive midfielder to anchor Nico Estevez's roster. And then, quite simply, he wasn't the right fit. He was only here on loan, now he's off on another loan, and also playing for Angola.\n\n* **Leo Chu (MF) to Alverca (POR)** - Received in the Jesus Ferreira trade from Seattle, Chu never really found a place at the part of the roster where you actually play in Frisco save for a handful of minutes and a single goal. Another piece of business that was in everyone's best interests.\n\n* **Marco Farfan (DF) to Tigres UANL (MEX)** - Unlike the players above, Marco Farfan was a regular fixture of the FC Dallas starting lineup for four seasons. But, as is necessary in a salary cap, business is business, and Tigres has money. He's been playing regularly for Tigres ever since, and good for him.\n\n* **Lucho Acosta (MF) to Fluminense (BRA)** - I've talked a lot about Acosta's short spell in Frisco already in this post, so I don't need to dig in much more. A decision that would have been unimaginable and unthinkable in May (unless you read the threads in the FC Cincinnati subreddit) that ended up turning the season around. Crazy to watch a man's desire to play the sport crumble in real time over the span of weeks. He's thriving in Brazil, and I couldn't be happier.\n\n* **Herbert Endeley (FW) option declined** - Endeley was a fringe player on loan in Colorado Springs. And then he tore his ACL. He's 24, recovering, and even when he was healthy he didn't keep his spot on the roster. Tough, but that's how it goes sometimes.\n\n* **Sebastian Lletget (MF) option declined** - Lletget was a serious part of the FC Dallas roster - for around 3 seasons. And then we watched him age and slow down before our eyes as everything else on the field started to click post-Acosta. By the end of the year, he was gassed, maybe good for a single half, but not someone you can rely on week after week. And he was getting *paid*. Another easy decision.\n\n* **Pedrinho (FW) option declined** - Last year, when he was signed from NTSC, I thought he was going places. I thought he was about to fight his way into the starting eleven. I, to put it mildly, missed the mark. He's just so inconsistent. He's young, yes, but it meant that putting him into the lineup (or even bringing him off the bench) was a gamble, and one that didn't often pay off. Tough to see him go, all the while.\n\n* **Diego Pepi (FW) option declined** - Ricardo Pepi's younger brother, signed as a homegrown, played for NTSC, spent 2025 on loan in USL1, and with Texoma, he was never really earning his minutes. Could end up as a star in USL someday, but it's a long-shot to see him back on a MLS roster as it currently stands.\n\n* **Tomas Pondeca (FW) option declined** - Another local kid (who went to my high school, shout out the Marcus Marauders) who actuallyn joined FC Dallas via a local tryout for North Texas, and managed to crack some first team minutes. But he spent 2025 on a disappointing loan in New Mexico. Instead, looks like he's heading to Corpus Christi for their inaugural professional season.\n\n* **Carl Sainte (DF) option declined** - Sainte ended up at North Texas via a loan from New Mexico, got signed permanently, won the 2024 MLSNP title with them, and then got a shot at the first team where he, as is a recurring trend here, didn't quite fit. Whether as a defender or a defensive midfielder, there wasn't a spot where he really looked comfortable. After an alright loan in Phoenix, he's now moving to El Paso.\n\n* **Anthony Ramirez (MF) option declined** - This is a young, high-ceiling player who wasn't offering much to FC Dallas - yet - but those who paid close attention (read: Buzz Carrick) were long on him. He might end up back with NTSC, or he might end up elsewhere in MLSNP. I'd still expect to see something from him the next few years maybe.\n\n* **Tarik Scott (FW) option declined** - Tarik Scott spent the entirety of his soccer career in the FC Dallas system, joining the academy at the age of 5. He went through the pipeline, joining North Texas in 2022 and signing a homegrown contract with the first team for 2023. With NTSC, he was exceptional, and then he got hurt. And after recovering, had to compete with Farrington for minutes in 2024. He's still a young, high-ceiling player, and he's off to Lexington SC.\n\n* **Alejandro Urzua (MF) option declined** - Urzua spent his entire first team contract with NTSC, and most of it injured. He's young, but already injury prone, and it's another big gamble for a player who's about to be eligible for a significant salary bump. I expect to see him pop up in USL.\n\n* **Jacob Jackson (GK) contract expired** - The hero of the Miracle in St Louis, this one kinda stings. If anything, it's likely over money, as that one game was enough of a highlight reel to demand a serious contract from anyone. Nobody has locked him down yet, so anything could happen. But even if he ends up elsewhere, I hope he gets paid.\n\n* **Maarten Paes (GK) to Ajax (NED)** - When you have Collodi emerging as an excellent starting keeper, and guys like Jackson as a backup (or, currently, Jonathan Sirois), Maarten Paes is less of a critical piece. Combined with wanting to go home for family reasons, and also getting a call from Ajax, this is another good piece of business that also does right by Paes. A tough decision, but the right one. \n\n#Transfers In: \n\n* **Kaick (MF) from Gremio (BRA)** - Oh look, a young, high-ceiling, long-shot midfielder signed from Gremio! What are the chances? Another classic Zanotta gamble mid-season, and this one immediately paid off. Young Kaick was a frequent starter in 2025 and even got a pair of goals for his efforts. I expect he'll stick around for another year or two before getting a fuck-you-money offer from somewhere, but for now, we're enjoying his contributions.\n\n* **Louicius Deedson (FW) from Odense (DEN)** Deedson was signed as winger depth, and so far, that's what he's been. Probably the third choice on the right wing at the moment, but a nice bit of reinforcement.\n\n* **Chris Cappis (MF) from Viking (NOR)** - An academy kid who went to Europe making his return to North Texas now that he's gotten some top flight minutes in Europe. Cappis rapidly grabbed the spot alongside Ramiro in the double pivot upon joining midseason. Genuinely hope we can keep him around for a while.\n\n* **Samuel Sarver (FW) from North Texas SC** - Finally promoting a 2025 draft pick who impressed with NTSC in 2025 to the first team. He's been slamming in goals and getting acolades in MLSNP, is a great locker room guy, and could get some serious first team minutes in 2026.\n\n* **Ran Binyamin (MF) from Hapoel Tel Aviv** - This is an odd signing. Yes, he's a good box-to-box dual threat midfielder. But, like, we have more than a handful of those right now, with multiple different possible configurations of 6s and 8s. He's a discount U22 guy, but also uses one of those slots. Weird.\n\n* **Herman Johansson (DF) from Mjällby AIF (SWE)** - If Johansson didn't need an international slot, this would be a fantastic signing for an area where there's not quite as much depth. He led Mjällby to their first Allsvenskan title, and fills a real need, but at a cost. But he's still likely to earn fans and attention in Frisco.\n\n* **Jonathan Sirois (GK) from Impact de Montreal** - With Jacob Jackson able to request a premium salary, sometimes you take the same sort of swing. Sirois has had some excellent games for Montreak, and also for the (sadly defunct) Valour FC in the CPL. An excellent backup for Collodi who can handle starts whenever needed.\n\n* **Joaquin Valiente (MF) from Defensor Sporting (URY)** - Ooh, another young midfielder/winger signed from a South American team! This could be another one of those lucky low-risk gambles that's taken guys from obscurity to stardom, or maybe an interim 10-ish guy as needed, or maybe just depth.\n\n* **Brooks Thompson (GK) from Lexington SC** - Thompson is a young keeper who's floated around MLS(NP) and USL since turning pro as a homegrown with SKC, and while he's never been a significant starter, he's never been terrible. Good keeper depth when you need a 3rd one.\n\n#Homegrowns:\n\n* **Joshua Torquato (DF)** - Signed mid-season in 2025 after getting some MLS minutes up from NTSC. More young defensive depth and while he's mostly played right back, could be a right centerback or right wing in a 3-5-2.\n\n* **Jaidyn Contreras (FW)** - Contreras had some highlights mostly off the bench with NTSC, and at the age of 18, it's time to give him a shot to see if he can crack the first team. He'll likely still play mostly with NTSC this year.\n\n* **Kaka Scabin (MF)** - After recovering from an ACL injury last year, Scabin has also been signed to a similar deal, again mostly going to be continuing to rehab and develop with NTSC.\n\n* **Slade Starnes (DF)** - Here's one to watch. Starnes played for the academy, captained SMU to some decent success, is an unusually skilled two-way centerback, and fills a real tangible gap on the roster. I'd be surprised if he's not getting some starts this year. Could be another long-term fixture in the back line.\n\n* **Caleb Swann (MF)** - Another young midfielder on a promote-or-cut MLSNP-to-homegrown contract, he looked good with NTSC last year and is expected to play there again this year.\n\n#Draft Picks:\n\n* **R1 S2 - Ricky Louis (FW) from Georgia Southern**\n* **R1 S3 - Nicholas Simmonds (FW) from Virginia**\n* *R1 S16 - Niklas Herceg (GK) from Vermont - unsigned*\n* *R2 S40 - Edouard Nys (MF) from UIC - unsigned*\n* *R2 S44 - Umberto Pela (MF) from Virginia - unsigned*\n* *R3 S6 - Olayinka Ogunleye (DF) from Louisville - unsigned*\n\n----\n\n#Prognosis:\n\nAh, my favourite part, it's \\#SpeculationTime. Every single year I try and offer three possible scenarios and inevitably get it kind of half right on one of them. Usually, maybe.\n\nLast year was interesting in that the season featured all 3 predicted scenario.\n\nIt started with the reasonable case, with players coming back from injury, new signings finding their footing, and young players developing. People kept turning out through the inconsistent spring, and there was definitely a growing foundation to work with. Eric Quill learned the ropes coaching in MLS, and for the first third of the season, things looked entirely fine if unexceptional.\n\nAnd then we got the worst case. Full \\#FlamingMeteor, with Acosta demanding out and the complete collapse during the summer, that had the team inept and incapable and embarassing to watch. We were, in fact, under a point per game at one point, my own arbitrary threshold for a dire season.\n\nAfter Lucho leaves, though, we get the best case. Fans keep showing up, the roster starts playing exciting soccer, players get some major highlights, and we sneak into the playoffs off the back of young talent. An end to the year that did in fact set the tone for the Eric Quill era.\n\nAnd with that, the 3 scenarios.\n\n#Best Case:\n\nA more consistent run of form sees FC Dallas within playoff contention all season long. The roster's depth ensures the team can handle some fixture congestion and the colossal gap in home games (May 13 to September 5, holy shit), the new signings can earn their stripes, and the team picks up where they left off at the end of last year. Not a crazy contender, but a team that continues trending in the right direction and makes the playoffs once again. And maybe we have a decent time in the USOC or League's Cup.\n\n#Worst Case:\n\nThings implode again, only without a singular player at the middle of it all. Quill loses the locker room, the team gets destroyed during the 9-match summer on the road, and even more players start demanding out of Frisco. Last year slightly redefined how bad this team could look for me, and to be perfectly honest, as much as I'm overall feeling better about FCD in 2026, that's not left my memory. \n\n#Reasonable Case:\n\nDallas looks like a young, reworked, developing team. Results are streaky and inconsistent, but they come. Midseason reinforcements take the team from the fringes of the postseason across the line at the last minute once again, only to not see much for it on the other side of Decision Day. The road trip saps out energy from the team and fans leading to some leaner quieter nights in September, and the (reduced capacity) sellout streak ends.\n\n----\n\n#Concluding Remarks\n\n\"Here's hoping I don't look stupid come August.\n\nAgain.\"\n\nThat's how I started this segment last year. And god, I looked pretty damn stupid, unless getting the worst case scenario prediction correct counts as a form of being smart. Dealer's choice.\n\nEverything can happen in MLS, and for last year, it all happened in Frisco, I tell ya. What a weird year that makes predicting the followup even weirder. I have no fucking idea what 2026 could entail, because everything is on the table. This team could jump out of the gate like 2016 and contend for a double. They could moderately improve on where things ended last year, and sneak into the playoffs maybe as a slightly higher seed. Or, they could dissolve into a mixture of reinforced concrete, collagen, and craft lagers. Things look great in preseason right now, but that's preseason, which hasn't indicated much for FCD ever. And the trend of NTSC doing well a few years before the first team, not much correlation there either.\n\nPlus there's the interference of the World Cup in Dallas this summer, making the vibes around this team feel really Off. Couldn't tell you what it is specifically, but yeah. Something in the air.\n\nI'll be watching the home opener with my emotional support ducky plushie in my cargo shorts pocket just in case.\n\n----\n\n#Online Resources\n\n**Official Links:** [Website](https://www.fcdallas.com) | [Twitter](https://twitter.com/FCDallas) | [Instagram](http://instagram.com/fcdallas)\n\n**Unofficial Links:** [3rd Degree](https://3rdDegree.net)\n\n----\n\nplease come to our games, they're fun, honestly",

    "text": "For context, I am a 25F (South Indian) living with my parents. I’m not married and don't plan to be anytime soon. On the surface, my parents are \"good\" parents. They encourage me to have a career first and never forced marriage on me (which is rare for Indian parents once a daughter hits 20). I have no restrictions on going out though I don’t go out much, and when I do, I provide a full itinerary and never stay out late. I have no dress code restrictions either, though I prefer dressing modestly anyway. They can be funny, and sometimes I genuinely enjoy their company. Compared to my friends' or cousins' parents, mine seem 100 times better.\n\nHowever, that’s just the surface. Most of the time, they can be the worst parents imaginable. I’ve accepted that their parenting comes from strict Indian cultural guidelines, but some days it’s just unbearable.\n\n**FAIR WARNING: I KNOW I AM THE AHOLE IN SOME SITUATIONS.**\n\nLet’s talk about my mom first. My mom (48) had a horrific life. She was tortured by my paternal grandparents(Like a typical Indian DIL), my dad was an absolute useless piece of... well, you know. He’s always had job troubles, being unemployed for months at a time, and he is a HUGE mama’s boy. He never stuck up for my mom or me.\n\nNaturally, this made my mom resentful toward my dad and his family. Even her own parents weren’t great; every adult in her life failed her, and she ended up with a horrible life partner. I would have understood her if her resentment stayed with them, and I even support her through those struggles. But that resentment turned toward me a long time ago.\n\nI happen to have a lot of genes from my dad’s side. My mom’s gene pool probably makes up only 10% of me on a good day. This has been a trigger for her since I was a kid, and I’ve been listening to her taunts, casual body shaming comments, about it my whole life. I get that looking at me reminds her of the people she wants to erase, but it’s not my fault I was born this way. It destroyed my self-esteem and started my \"mom-pleasing\" journey, which later spiraled into a full-on people-pleasing disease.\n\nShe compensated for her own deadbeat mother by micromanaging me to an insane degree even counting my underwear and bras(so that she can see if I am using them properly or spoiling them) at age of 18-19. When I finally snapped, she switched to the weapon she uses best: passive-aggression.\n\nTo make things worse, when I was 13, she had a massive, life-threatening health problem. She was **PARALYZED!** (yeah she had one hell of a life.) That turned her into a resentful human being who hates everyone and thinks everyone owes her. (which honestly many people do\\*\\*.\\*\\*)\n\n**{NOTE: I AM NOT MAKING HER HEALTH PROBLEM MINE. I AM JUST GIVING MY LIFE CONTEXT HERE. I KNOW SHE IS THE ONE WHO HAD THE WORST}**\n\nI was the one who suffered the most **INDIRECTLY**. At 13, I had to move from my hometown and my entire social circle to a new place right before 10th standard. I barely had any friends and I put on a lot of weight. I was bullied behind my back because no one had the guts to do it to my face, but it still hurt.\n\nThe school my parents chose was horrible. It made my physical and mental health worse, leading to permanent health problems I still face today. I begged them to change my school, but they refused because they believed I needed to be \"tortured\" into studying. That was the first of many experiences that turned me into the \"horrible\" person I am now.\n\nNow let's talk about my dad! **BUCKLE UP.**\n\nHe is the stereotypical Indian father who thinks his wife is his servant and his mother is the purest woman in the world. He’s in his late 50s and still behaves like a small child around his mother. To this day, whenever we visit my grandma’s house, he still sleeps in the same room as her, leaving me and my mom alone. (Yes, my grandma is still alive... *unfortunately*.)\n\nHe is a master of weaponized incompetence. He is perfectly capable of doing chores when they benefit him, but as soon as it’s something related to the house, my mom, or me? Suddenly, it’s as if his hands refuse to listen to him. He never listens to us; he makes absolutely horrible decisions and then comes crawling back to me to clean up his mess.\n\nHe also completely failed to support me through college. In India, parental support for education is the norm and expected, but I had to work a part-time job and tutor kids just so I could pay my own tuition and help cover household expenses.\n\nHe dumped my sick mom at her parents' house and dropped me at an aunt’s because I kid you not he \"couldn't handle\" braiding my long hair or packing a lunch box.\n\nBy 14, I had to move schools, lose my friends, my whole support group and learn how to run an entire household. I became the cook, the cleaner, and the nurse while my dad played the \"weaponized incompetence\" card. He’s a massive mama’s boy who has told us his mother is more important than us, yet he expects us to fix his messes.\n\nTo be fair, he *has* changed a lot. He’s less of a mama's boy now, handles more responsibility with finances/chores, and has become calmer. When they fight (which is 24/7, 365 days a year), he’s usually the one backing down and taking my mom’s nasty tantrums—some of which, honestly, he deserves.\n\n**The Breaking Point**\n\nYears of this have wrecked my health. I have dangerously low BP(to the point I used to faint often), chronic back pain, and my ADHD is spiraling. I’m currently studying for the CS (Company Secretary) exams—it’s incredibly difficult, and I had to quit my job to focus. Being home 90% of the time has turned our house into a war zone.\n\nDuring a recent blowout, I lost it. I told them: **\"I’m done. Once I pass this course, I’m leaving and never coming back. Don’t even call me if one of you dies.\"**\n\nI know the death comment was harsh. I was angry. But since then, the guilt-tripping has become a full-time job for them. My mom’s passive-aggressive comments are constant: *\"Why do you care? You said you’re leaving us anyway,\"* or *\"How can I trust you when you said you’d abandon me?\"* My father, already emotionally distant, has completely shut down.\n\nI’m 25. I know I shouldn’t need their approval, but I’m struggling. I want to emotionally detach and eventually cut them off, but years of \"parent-pleasing\" make the guilt feel like a physical weight. I find myself constantly wondering if I’m making the right choice.\n\n**So, AITA if I want to cut them off emotionally and distance myself from them completely?**",

Its a blowout and a snowball depending on who is sitting at the table and from a social perspective, outright horrible.\n\nThere a so many ways to accrue card draw and value in bracket 3 that are actually honest with deckbuilding and synergy in mind.\n\nIt seems Rhystic is at an impasse and why not potentially explore a compromise for everyone.\n\nMake Rhystic a “super” game changer (call it whatever you like) and force your deck to be bracket 4 and 5 if you want to play with it. Its play pattern is conducive to those power levels. \n\nYou can appease the various arguments that are for keeping it (monetary. Which I think is a terrible argument) and satisfy those who want to still play with it. \n\nLet’s honestly keep it real, its a spike card, it should not have place in bracket 3.

    "text": "This is long so hang in there with me. My husband (20M) and I (21F) are expecting our first - a little girl, by May 30th. It’s a high risk pregnancy for me, I have HG, and a history of miscarriages, so we both are very happy to be this far along with our little one! \n\nWe found out in late September, and roughly a month prior, we got in a huge blowout with his family. Long story short, his parents are divorced, and his mom was his primary parent growing up. One of those boy moms (no shade to boy moms, just not a fan of this kind lol) who could see no flaws in her sons. She has three boys of her own, my husband being the oldest, and two adopted daughters. The difference in expectations is insane, the boys were raised to do absolutely nothing, no expectations to share household responsibilities, and my BIL often says some of the most horrific things about women, sexual assault, and is very open about his pornographic behaviors, while my MIL laughs it off bc “he’s just a boy,” but it’s upsetting knowing he has two sisters who shouldn’t have to hear that. My husband is very against it, and tries to match my efforts in household duties and we share efforts 50/50. MIL absolutely hates this, and thinks I’m a terrible wife for “forcing him” to cook and clean, when in all reality he loves it and is vocal about it to her. Things hit a head when we ended up going no contact with his family, (his choice) due to some pretty horrible and nasty comments made about our decision to get married, my character, and it’s been insane as of late. We tried to reconcile and made attempts to repair the relationship, but my MIL was very frustrated at all of our boundaries that we set, and again, no matter how much my husband expressed that he felt this way and it wasn’t coming from me, she would tell every family member that I was abusing him and manipulating him into feeling this way. It’s just been rough. Back in November, she sent my husband one of the nastiest texts about me, and for the first time, I snapped. Normally my husband handles all conflict between her, but this time I was so frustrated that she would say something so horrible about me, (essentially that I’m so mentally ill and unstable I’ve convinced my husband that he loves me but he actually secretly resents me and everyone can see that he’s a victim…) I finally messaged her and told her I had enough and that I would no longer be participating in any form of a relationship with her while she continues to say those things about me, because we had a good relationship for a long time, until we decided to get married and she started losing control over my husband. I told her I wouldn’t be allowing her to contact me anymore because I wasn’t able to sit idly by and listen to what she had to say, so I blocked her. Best. Decision. Ever. My husband was enraged that she would say such things and that she would tell his entire family those things, and he also made his own decision to fully cut contact as well. We were enjoying our peace, focusing on my growing pregnancy, and finally letting things settle. We announced to the world that we were pregnant about two weeks later, and her response was to call me evil, say I baby-trapped him, and essentially call for me to get an abortion. At that point, we still were no contact, so I removed the from my social media so they wouldn’t have to see any baby-updates if it bothered them. Around Christmas, she asked his youngest brother to message us and pretend to have a gift for us, and we felt weary about it, but came by and he gave us a gift from her. It was a sweet gesture, it contained snacks and gift-cards to restaurants, but my husband did not feel like he was ready to open the door to a relationship again, so we told his brother to tell them thank you on our behalf and left it at that. Fast forward to last week, I got two packages delivered to our house that were from my target registry… turns out my MIL found our registry and purchased us our high chair and a car-seat. This was a big gesture, a large amount of money spent, and we were shocked since it’s been about 4 months of no contact now. I don’t know what to do. She’s been unblocked for a while now, but never messaged us to let us know she purchased the items, didn’t leave a note when she purchased them, and it was just a big shock. I encouraged my husband to send a Thank You message, because maybe this was her attempt at reconciliation, and I wanted to show our appreciation, but that was a week ago and she didn’t even respond. \n\n The whole situation is weird, we don’t know what this means going forward, they’ve been incredibly disrespectful about the pregnancy, as we’ve heard through his siblings, and have continued to disrespect the boundaries he’s set. One of which being that one of his brothers will not be allowed around our daughter once she’s born, because of some comments he’s made previously and his behavior. My concern is that even though my husband sets these boundaries, they blame me for them. The fear is, if we allow them to be around our daughter, they would break our boundaries in front of me, or try to do it secretly when I’m not around. I’m open to the idea of a relationship for the sake of our daughter, but it’s just so confusing to navigate because they’ve made it clear they only care about my husband and his daughter, and that isolates me from being her literal mom and the one carrying her. \n\nMy husband doesn’t want to do anything Im not comfortable with, and is fine never speaking to them again, but I just don’t know what we should do and how we should handle this moving forward. Thoughts? Advice? Anything helps.",

I got Madden during Christmas sale so I had time to build up a good NMS MUT squad (95 ovr), but I noticed almost all my opponents have multiple ovr 99 cards and I get cooked online often in MUT. I have a much better record in just regular head to head, so I'm guessing even a couple points of OVR between players makes a big difference. \n\nI like the back and forth aspect of the regular h2h where games don't feel like blowouts unless you are really bad at playcalling. in MUT, it feels like you can do everything right and get cooked either way. yet, MUT player numbers are way higher than online h2h. \n\nIs online h2h more fair than mut h2h?  it's more fun, but I can't tell (as a bills loyalist) if it's only because I'm playing a strong team",

    "text": "For context, I am a 25F (South Indian) living with my parents. I’m not married and don't plan to be anytime soon. On the surface, my parents are \"good\" parents. They encourage me to have a career first and never forced marriage on me (which is rare for Indian parents once a daughter hits 20). I have no restrictions on going out though I don’t go out much, and when I do, I provide a full itinerary and never stay out late. I have no dress code restrictions either, though I prefer dressing modestly anyway. They can be funny, and sometimes I genuinely enjoy their company. Compared to my friends' or cousins' parents, mine seem 100 times better.\n\nHowever, that’s just the surface. Most of the time, they can be the worst parents imaginable. I’ve accepted that their parenting comes from strict Indian cultural guidelines, but some days it’s just unbearable.\n\n**FAIR WARNING: I KNOW I AM THE AHOLE IN SOME SITUATIONS.**\n\nLet’s talk about my mom first. My mom (48) had a horrific life. She was tortured by my paternal grandparents(Like a typical Indian DIL), my dad was an absolute useless piece of... well, you know. He’s always had job troubles, being unemployed for months at a time, and he is a HUGE mama’s boy. He never stuck up for my mom or me.\n\nNaturally, this made my mom resentful toward my dad and his family. Even her own parents weren’t great; every adult in her life failed her, and she ended up with a horrible life partner. I would have understood her if her resentment stayed with them, and I even support her through those struggles. But that resentment turned toward me a long time ago.\n\nI happen to have a lot of genes from my dad’s side. My mom’s gene pool probably makes up only 10% of me on a good day. This has been a trigger for her since I was a kid, and I’ve been listening to her taunts, casual body shaming comments, about it my whole life. I get that looking at me reminds her of the people she wants to erase, but it’s not my fault I was born this way. It destroyed my self-esteem and started my \"mom-pleasing\" journey, which later spiraled into a full-on people-pleasing disease.\n\nShe compensated for her own deadbeat mother by micromanaging me to an insane degree even counting my underwear and bras(so that she can see if I am using them properly or spoiling them) at age of 18-19. When I finally snapped, she switched to the weapon she uses best: passive-aggression.\n\nTo make things worse, when I was 13, she had a massive, life-threatening health problem. She was **PARALYZED!** (yeah she had one hell of a life.) That turned her into a resentful human being who hates everyone and thinks everyone owes her. (which honestly many people do**.**) \n\n**{NOTE: I AM NOT MAKING HER HEALTH PROBLEM MINE. I AM JUST GIVING MY LIFE CONTEXT HERE. I KNOW SHE IS THE ONE WHO HAD THE WORST}**\n\nI was the one who suffered the most **INDIRECTLY**. At 13, I had to move from my hometown and my entire social circle to a new place right before 10th standard. I barely had any friends and I put on a lot of weight. I was bullied behind my back because no one had the guts to do it to my face, but it still hurt.\n\nThe school my parents chose was horrible. It made my physical and mental health worse, leading to permanent health problems I still face today. I begged them to change my school, but they refused because they believed I needed to be \"tortured\" into studying. That was the first of many experiences that turned me into the \"horrible\" person I am now.\n\nNow let's talk about my dad! **BUCKLE UP.**\n\nHe is the stereotypical Indian father who thinks his wife is his servant and his mother is the purest woman in the world. He’s in his late 50s and still behaves like a small child around his mother. To this day, whenever we visit my grandma’s house, he still sleeps in the same room as her, leaving me and my mom alone. (Yes, my grandma is still alive... *unfortunately*.)\n\nHe is a master of weaponized incompetence. He is perfectly capable of doing chores when they benefit him, but as soon as it’s something related to the house, my mom, or me? Suddenly, it’s as if his hands refuse to listen to him. He never listens to us; he makes absolutely horrible decisions and then comes crawling back to me to clean up his mess.\n\nHe also completely failed to support me through college. In India, parental support for education is the norm and expected, but I had to work a part-time job and tutor kids just so I could pay my own tuition and help cover household expenses.\n\nHe dumped my sick mom at her parents' house and dropped me at an aunt’s because I kid you not he \"couldn't handle\" braiding my long hair or packing a lunch box.\n\nBy 14, I had to move schools, lose my friends, my whole support group and learn how to run an entire household. I became the cook, the cleaner, and the nurse while my dad played the \"weaponized incompetence\" card. He’s a massive mama’s boy who has told us his mother is more important than us, yet he expects us to fix his messes.\n\nTo be fair, he *has* changed a lot. He’s less of a mama's boy now, handles more responsibility with finances/chores, and has become calmer. When they fight (which is 24/7, 365 days a year), he’s usually the one backing down and taking my mom’s nasty tantrums—some of which, honestly, he deserves.\n\n**The Breaking Point**\n\nYears of this have wrecked my health. I have dangerously low BP(to the point I used to faint often), chronic back pain, and my ADHD is spiraling. I’m currently studying for the CS (Company Secretary) exams—it’s incredibly difficult, and I had to quit my job to focus.

    "text": "*Note: I wrote this before the semifinals and had to leave it; I'm finishing it after the semifinals.*\n\nThe round robin, quarterfinals and semifinals of the 2026 Milano Cortina Women's Hockey Tournament has come and gone. 10 teams entered, and only 4 are still standing for a medal.\n\nLet's take a look at everyone's journey starting with the six teams who fell by the wayside.\n\n**France** (*The Alice Philbert Show*)\n\nFor this being your very first time in the women's Olympic tournament, I honestly was impressed. You even held Sweden scoreless over the last 39 minutes of that game. Damn.\n\nNo, you didn't win a game, but you gave yourselves every chance to, with three tough games including taking Germany to OT when the tournament was already lost for you.\n\nI will say this though - you've got yourself an absolute stud in net in Alice Philbert, but you're hosting the next Olympics. You need to get better in front of her. She can't do it all herself. A 40+ save performance in 3 out of 4 games can only get you so far.\n\n**Japan** (*We'll Smile Again Someday...*)\n\nI ask this with absolutely no pride whatsoever because I actually like watching the Japanese team play - what the hell happened to you?\n\nSeven goals over the entire tournament and Ukita and the Shiga sisters had a hand in four of them. As a team you played three decent games - it might be a stretch to say that for the game against Germany, but you did attempt to put together a rally there - it just didn't fall your way except against France.\n\nThe game against Italy was the ultimate decider. A game you played well in, but Gabriella Durante was not going to let her team miss the quarterfinals on home ice given the chance. No, that game didn't eliminate you, but you were up against it on the final day where you needed a regulation win over Sweden PLUS an Italian regulation win over Germany in order to sneak into the QFs on a tiebreaker. And that Swedish team was/is on a mission this year.\n\nThe road to the next Olympics for you starts now. Let's also see how you fair at the upcoming World Championship.\n\n**Italy** (*Marvellous in Milan!*)\n\nThis was a fantastic tournament for you in comparison to 2006. Remember back then when your women's team scored a whole 3 goals? Well, you tripled that output on your way to your very first quarterfinal in any women's IIHF tournament!\n\nUnfortunately, you ran into the buzzsaw that was the United States, and let's be honest, no one was expecting you to stop the Americans this year.\n\nWait... you held them to 6-0? And 1-0 outside of the second period?!\n\nOutsiders can blame the fact that you had some North American-born players but unlike China at the last games, they went through the eligibility process properly, including Laura Fortino who competed for Canada at the 2014 Olympics, but went through the process of switching and is now playing for Italy (caption on screen: We'll always remember 2014, Laura!).\n\nYou still had an amazing run on home ice in the Olympics. Take that to the next Worlds and the next Olympic cycle.\n\n**Germany** (*Get Us Out of This Format*)\n\nIf there's a team that's probably glad that the upcoming Women's World Championship, and Olympics in 2030, is finally moving away from the vertical group format, look no further than the Germans.\n\n(*Author's note: The Women's Olympic tournament went to a format in 2014 that placed all the top seeds in Group A and the lower seeds in Group B, in an effort to cut down on the number of one-sided blowouts taking place at the time. Now that the women's field has levelled out, the World Championship has already moved away from this format and the Olympics are expected to follow suit.*)\n\nI don't really know what to make of Germany's tournament. They were there, and they they weren't. Four games within three goals, and they went 3-1 in them.\n\nThe Welcke twins are proving to be part of Germany's future core in upcoming Worlds, but they haven't been able to show it, as, because of the format leading to teams like Germany constantly having to compete with Sweden for top spot in Group A (and avoiding the two North American powers in the semifinal), their one quarterfinal win (vs Russia in 2017) seems like a distant memory.\n\nNow that the Worlds and Olympics are retuning to snaked groups, this might be the break you needed to play against broader levels of competition and perhaps making a semifinal run.\n\nSandra Abstreiter is an amazing goalie and the foundation of you making any future run. Please don't waste her.\n\n**Finland** (*Victims of Norona-Chan*)\n\n*Caption on screen: 2026 U18 Women's World Championship, Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada, January 17, 2026, as we see footage from that game...*\n\n&gt;*\"And Hungary beats Finland 7-5 to stay at the top level of the U18 Women's World Championship! Finland will be relegated to Division 1A. An absolute disaster of a tournament for the Finns...\"*\n\n*Caption: \"Olympic Quarterfinal vs Switzerland...\" as we see footage...*\n\n&gt;CBC/TSN broadcaster Kenzie Lalonde: *\"Muller in alone, SHE SCORES! Alina Muller, the difference maker for Switzerland!\"*\n\n... as we see footage of Swiss fans celebrating. Then, fast forward to the final seconds...\n\n&gt;Lalonde: *\"2.6 seconds to go, off the faceoff... cleared by Switzerland! Alina Muller, the Swiss star, gets it done! For the first time ever at the Olympics, the Swiss upset the Finns in an elimination game!\"*\n\nWell, that was shitty... oh, and you also had a tournament to forget.\n\nSo far, this is very quickly shaping up to be the worst women's hockey season that Finland has ever had in their history. First, the U18 women get relegated, and then here, at the Olympics, you're bounced in the quarterfinals for the first time since 2014.\n\nHowever, unlike the women's U18 team, it's hard to talk about what could have been at an Olympics like this one, and it's hard for me to be overly critical because norovirus pretty much took half your team - and as a result, your tournament - away from you before it started.\n\n\\[*caption on screen: \"as a former athlete, I once tried to go right back to 100% after coming down with a virus and it blew up in my face in the worst way\"*\\]\n\nFrom what I've heard, norovirus is no joke and I imagine that played a factor in how you played here.\n\nYou scored three goals the entire tournament... all of them in one game... against a Swiss team that got their revenge on you in this semifinal.\n\nAgain, I'm not going to be too hard on you because norovirus clearly derailed your tournament and a fully healthy Finnish team is far more competitive than this...\n\n**Czechia** (*Uhhh... Carla?*)\n\n... you, on the other hand, are making me scratch my head.\n\nAmong non-North American teams, you were widely regarded as the biggest medal threat in the entire tournament, and even more so after what happened to Finland. A medal was yours to lose... and you lost it.\n\nI thought maybe the back and forth game vs Switzerland where you lost in a shootout was just an anomaly, but you go on to score four goals over the entire tournament outside of that.\n\nOh, and of those seven goals, three of them were from Natalie Mlynkova and no one else had more than one. Adela Sapovalivova, one of the biggest names from that Czech team who upset Canada at the 2024 U18s, was held to a single assist.\n\nAnd then there's the large elephant in the room - not pulling your goalie after Sweden took a penalty with 4:42 to go, to go 6 on 4. I personally didn't think much of the decision but the consensus seems to be that that was your opportunity. And it didn't sit well with some fans.\n\nAccording to them, this might be the end of the line for Carla MacLeod. I've seen suggestions that she might not be behind the bench come next Olympics. Only time will tell.\n\n**\\[colour test screen beep\\]**\n\nSix teams down, four teams to go. The medals are still to be handed out, so let's look at our competitors, first for the bronze medal...\n\n**Sweden** (*Burying the Past*)\n\nThat sound you hear is just about every Swedish women's hockey fan going \"Slutligen!\" (Swedish for \"Finally!\").\n\nGetting back to the semifinals has been a long time coming for this Swedish team after a disaster of an era in the late 2010s, fuelled by one of the worst hockey coaches I've ever seen in Leif Boork. They got out of it, and across many World Championships, had come close, including taking Canada to OT at the 2023 World Championships (caption: \"I was at that game\") but never could break back through... until now.\n\nA huge win over Czechia - who I just said was the biggest non-North American medal threat - to get back to the top four and win your first medal at an IIHF event since bronze at the 2007 World Championship.\n\nEbba Svensson Traff shut out the Czechs on 29 starts to get you there, and even though you got steamrolled by the U.S. in the semifinals - so did everyone else. With Hanna Olsson and and Johnasson leading you in scoring, and Ebba Hedqvist spearing a youth movement, a medal here would go a long way towards putting an end to the last remnants of the late 2010s for good.\n\nStanding in your way is a team with their own humps to get over...\n\n**Switzerland** (*Muller's Second Reward?*)\n\nAlina Muller was only 15 years old when she and the Swiss team won bronze at the 2014 Olympics against Sweden. And now she's back to add to that total.\n\nShe and Lara Stalder are the two holdovers from that team, and they've always had top 5 finishes but haven't broken through since that 2014 Olympic bronze, and now here is their chance - to do it against the same team that you did it against in Sochi.\n\nLike the Finns, your starting goalie, Andrea Braendli, was plagued with norovirus, but she's come back in a big way, with a 40 save shutout against those Finns and nearly stonewalling Canada.\n\nIt's going to be a bronze medal game for the ages, but now on to the top prize...\n\n**\\[colour test screen beep\\]**\n\nThe gold medal game is upon us. In one corner...\n\n**United States** (*Female Birds Fly Freer?*)\n\nA second upset at the hands of Sweden at an Olympics in Italy wasn't in the cards today. Not only was the U.S. on a mission to prevent that, but they've only allowed one goal in the entire tournament. With a healthy mix of PWHL and NCAA players, the U.S. is set on righting the wrongs of 2022.\n\nHarvey, Keller, Edwards, Bilka, Carpenter to name a few. And even if you get past them, there's the brick wall known as Aerin Frankel keeping all your shots out.\n\nThis is a monster. A team that hasn't lost a single game to anyone since the 2024 World Championship, and they have showed why at these Olympics. The gold medal is theirs for the taking, and they just have one more obstacle to get past...\n\n**Canada** (*My Confidence Isn't High...*)\n\nAs a Canadian, I honestly think we were lucky to get here this year. After getting steamrolled in four straight Rivalry Series games to the U.S., I saw claims that these games were just for evaluation purposes.\n\nExcept that that claim doesn't hold water when you see that the Rivalry Series roster wasn't getting it done, then basically decided to bring the same players anyway.\n\nMarie-Philip Poulin is the absolute greatest. She's already in Canadian GOAT conversations, as much as I hate that acronym. In the semifinal she scored two goals to break Wickenheiser's record for most career Olympic goals by a woman. But especially at 35 and especially on one leg, she can't do it herself.\n\nAnd your youngest players have made most of the impact at this tournament. CBC put out a graphic during the quarterfinal displaying the youth movement of Gosling, Gardiner, Fillier, O'Neill and Watts and the impact they've had in the tournament. If that wasn't a hint to get younger, I don't know what is.\n\nJennifer Gardiner is your youngest player (besides the third goalie, Kayle Osborne) and all 9 other teams in the tournament brought at least 9 players each who are younger than she is.\n\nTroy Ryan *was* a great coach for Canada in 2022, and I'll always be thankful for that run and the 2024 World Championship run, but he did not have it this year. And I don't think my expectations for a Canada-USA game have ever been lower...\n\n**Predictions!**\n\nAs much as I'd love to see Poulin deliver one more game winning goal for Canada on the Olympic stage, I don't see it happening, if the Rivalry Series is any indication. The U.S. wins 4-1.\n\nAs for the bronze, I've got Sweden 3-2 in OT over Switzerland to put an end to their era of turmoil once and for all.",

    "text": "I need practical advice on how to force DVSA to do the absolute minimum they’re supposed to do.\n\nI’m an HGV driver. I worked on the Sainsbury’s Dartford operation (DHL Supply Chain). After I raised safety concerns (including being pressured to work beyond legal limits and reporting a serious road incident tyre blowout due to brake failure on M25), my “safety/compliance” record suddenly became the weapon used to remove me from duty.\n\nHere’s the core issue — and it’s document-verifiable:\n\n* I have the **primary driver-card UTC printout** (what the driver card actually recorded).\n* I have the **Tachomaster reconstructed output** for the same period.\n* I have **time-stamped audit/manual correction evidence** showing a manual/reconstructed entry created after the fact.\n* The reconstructed Tachomaster output does **not** match the primary driver-card UTC record.\n\nThis is not “interpretation”. It’s a mismatch you can see by putting two documents side-by-side. Any competent reviewer can confirm the contradiction in seconds.\n\nWhat makes this worse: DVSA refuses to do even a basic technical verification. And they don’t just refuse to me — they sent my MP evasive replies that keep changing the narrative:\n\n1. First DVSA tells my MP (in writing) that they can’t investigate because records are “only required to be kept for **MINIMUM** 12 months”, so an investigation “would not have been possible”. That’s a non sequitur: “minimum retention” doesn’t prove the data doesn’t exist. It also doesn’t answer the basic question: **did DVSA check anything at all?** The letter doesn’t say they requested anything, checked audit logs, compared documents, nothing.\n2. Then DVSA tells my MP (in a later letter) that they can’t comment further because it’s “the subject of an Employment Tribunal / ongoing legal process”. Again: they use “ongoing legal process” as a blanket shutdown, without explaining:\n\n* what they verified,\n* what policy/legal basis they rely on,\n* why a regulator can’t answer a simple technical integrity question.\n\nSo DVSA can’t investigate because “12 months”, but also can’t talk because “ongoing legal process”, and meanwhile they offer my MP a visit “to reassure integrity” — while refusing to state whether they verified anything. Its something realy wrong with DVSA if they rather spend 2 min on verification they spent hours for evasion.\n\nI’m not asking DVSA to resolve an employment dispute. I’m asking for a regulator to do what regulators do: **verify integrity of safety/compliance records** when there is primary evidence and an audit trail showing manual change after 4 days by DHL.\n\n**What are the most effective legal/administrative routes to force DVSA to give a real, accountable response and actually verify this evidence?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ydk03i9p0kg1.png?width=1464&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a22d32506878abe54006cbb94034c5a158c5cab2\n\nThis is what they should compare and refuse because its a Pandora's box not only for DHL.\n\n* **primary driver-card UTC printout** \n* **Tachomaster reconstructed output**",

    "text": "***“A Global Contract Stack is a layered set of interoperable agreements + protocols that keep cross-border categories (identity, property, liability, provenance) synchronized within the Spine Corridor—by continuously paying the entropy budget for record-keeping, verification, dispute handling, and enforcement coordination.”***\n\nI am the executive doing all the systems thinking and strategic thinking. Using my 35-year experience at the University of the Philippines, I am also the creator/developer — with help from company colleagues — of the model involved, Bridge360 Metatheory Model. LLM1, LLM2, LLM3, LLM4, and LLM5 are the rank and file clerks serving as interlocutors showing me information I have little or no time to access. \\[ChatGPT (LLM1), Gemini (LLM2), Perplexity (LLM3), Claude (LLM4), Grok (LLM5)\\]\n\n***Note: Mathematical expressions here are in marked down text format; this author has to find time in the future to replace these with the necessary standard mathematical symbolisms.***\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/llkujs7ua0kg1.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5b4224759e5879a86b96b1eb05b0faac57c7295\n\nPrompt issued to LLM1, meaning ChatGPT-5.2 apprised earlier of Bridge360 Metatheory Model v20.3, in the middle of a long conversation:\n\nAll human groups have culture but not all cultures develop into scaffoldings affording economic and political systems with high-fidelity categories (property, contract, identity, liability), audit loops, and enforcement.\n\nLLM1 response:\n\nAgreed—*and the clean, non-essentialist way to state it* is:\n\nAll groups have culture, but only some cultures (more precisely: **culture + institutions + material/technical stack + exposure history**) accumulate the **coordination scaffolding** required for high-fidelity, large-scale systems.\n\n**Why some cultures don’t (without implying incapacity)**\n\nThose high-fidelity categories—**property, contract, identity, liability**—are not just “beliefs.” They require:\n\n* **Standardized representations**: writing, records, identifiers, cadastral maps, account ledgers, interoperable forms.\n* **Measurement capacity**: units, statistics, audits, registries; the ability to *count and compare* reliably across time and across strangers.\n* **Enforcement and adjudication**: courts, police, credible sanctions; stable procedures people expect will be applied.\n* **Trust beyond kinship**: norms and mechanisms that let strangers transact at scale (reputation systems, insurance, third-party verification).\n* **Administrative bandwidth**: bureaucracy, taxation capacity, compliance routines, and the ability to detect fraud.\n\nIf those are absent or too costly relative to the environment, cultures will rationally rely on lower-fidelity but robust substitutes:\n\n* kinship obligations, patronage, customary law, oral contracts, local reciprocity, face-to-face enforcement.\n\n**Bridge360 framing**\n\nHigh-fidelity systems are “tight-spine” architectures: they’re powerful but expensive in entropy budget (continuous record-keeping, verification, dispute resolution). Cultures that don’t build that stack are often optimizing for **corridor stability under limited bandwidth**—not failing a cognitive test.\n\n**A useful one-liner**\n\n“**Culture is universal; governance-grade abstractions are infrastructural.**”\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a short “scaffolding ladder” (levels 0–5) showing what gets added at each stage from customary coordination → modern high-fidelity state/market systems.\n\nPrompt issued to LLM1:\n\nYes—those “high-fidelity” scaffolds are expensive because they require **continuous entropy spending** to keep categories aligned across millions of strangers. A **social contract** (nation-building) is the mechanism that legitimizes and stabilizes that spending.\n\n**Why the social contract is the enabler**\n\nHigh-fidelity systems need people to accept:\n\n* **shared categories** (property titles, legal identity, liability rules),\n* **shared procedures** (courts, audits, taxation, registries),\n* **shared enforcement** (police power, sanctions), even when outcomes are locally inconvenient.\n\nThat acceptance is basically: *“I’ll comply today because the system will be predictable tomorrow, and because everyone else is bound too.”* That’s social-contract logic.\n\n**Entropy-budget view**\n\nYou can frame it as three ongoing “cost centers”:\n\n1. **Measurement &amp; records** (IDs, ledgers, land registry, statistics) Keeps the map synchronized with the territory of transactions.\n2. **Verification &amp; auditing** (fraud checks, inspections, compliance) Prevents category drift and gaming.\n3. **Dispute resolution &amp; enforcement** (courts, arbitration, police) Closes the loop when incentives diverge.\n\nWithout a social contract, those costs look like arbitrary extraction or oppression; compliance drops, gaming rises, and the system falls back to lower-fidelity coordination (kinship, patronage, localism).\n\n**Nation-building as “scaffold lock-in”**\n\nNation-building is the process of achieving enough consensus (or at least consent) on:\n\n* who counts as a member (identity),\n* what is owned and transferable (property/contract),\n* how harms are priced and punished (liability),\n* who may coerce whom, and under what rules (enforcement legitimacy).\n\nThat “consent layer” is like the **compressive layer** in the Gorilla Glass analogy: it doesn’t remove conflict, but it prevents small cracks from turning into systemic fracture by keeping the enforcement-and-audit loop politically survivable.\n\nIf you want, I can restate this in a Hobbes–Locke–Rousseau mapping using your Bridge360 “spine corridor + leakage” language (no truth-claims, just stability conditions).\n\nPrompt issued to LLM1:\n\n“.. expensive in entropy budget (continuous record-keeping, verification, dispute resolution).” Ergo, requiring social contracts on the scale of globalization given current linkages via technology at large.\n\nLLM response:\n\nYes—the same logic scales upward. If technology links societies into tightly coupled trade/finance/info networks, then “high-fidelity categories” have to interoperate across borders, and that demands a **global-scale social contract** (or at least contract *layers*) to pay the entropy budget of keeping the shared maps aligned.\n\n**Why globalization raises the entropy bill**\n\nCross-border linkages multiply the need for:\n\n* **Interoperable identity** (KYC/AML, travel/immigration status, beneficial ownership)\n* **Interoperable property &amp; contract** (choice-of-law, recognition of judgments, IP, cross-border collateral)\n* **Interoperable liability** (product safety, pollution, cyber incidents, financial contagion)\n* **Audit &amp; verification** (standards, inspections, accounting rules, supply-chain traceability)\n* **Enforcement** (sanctions regimes, dispute forums, extradition, trade remedies)\n\nWithout shared rules, the system runs on ad hoc power, bilateral deals, or “trusted club” arrangements—cheap short-term, but brittle at scale.\n\n**What “global social contract” realistically looks like**\n\nNot one world constitution. More like a **stack of partial contracts**:\n\n1. **Standards contracts**: technical protocols, accounting standards, safety norms\n2. **Trade/investment contracts**: tariffs, market access, arbitration frameworks\n3. **Financial contracts**: payment rails, clearing, disclosure, resolution regimes\n4. **Information contracts**: data protection, cyber norms, content governance interfaces\n5. **Externality contracts**: climate, fisheries, pandemics, migration coordination\n\nEach layer is a way to fund the entropy-cost of alignment (measurement, verification, dispute handling) so the system doesn’t revert to fragmentation.\n\n**Bridge360 “spine corridor” phrasing**\n\nTechnology increases coupling → reduces slack → narrows the corridor unless you add governance bandwidth. A global social-contract stack is basically **corridor maintenance infrastructure**: it pays for continuous category synchronization so leakage doesn’t cascade (supply-chain ruptures, capital flight, sanction spirals, misinfo shocks).\n\n**The key trade**\n\n* **More linkage without shared contracts** → lower apparent friction, but higher hidden fragility (Gorilla-Glass effect).\n* **More linkage with contract layers** → higher overhead, but better shock absorption.\n\nIf you want, I can sketch a compact “Global Contract Stack” architecture with tripwires: what metrics signal category drift (identity drift, audit failure rates, cross-border dispute backlog, standard divergence), and what governance primitives reduce leakage without requiring full political unification.\n\nPrompt issued to LLM1:\n\n“.. expensive in entropy budget (continuous record-keeping, verification, dispute resolution).” Ergo, requiring social contracts on the scale of globalization given current linkages via technology at large.\n\nLLM1 response:\n\nYes—the same logic scales upward.

Technical Interop**\n\n**Purpose:** Make systems talk and transact reliably (the “wiring”).  \n**Artifacts:** internet protocols, PKI/certificates, time-stamping, secure hardware roots, logistics standards (barcodes/RFID), cryptographic signing.  \n**Failure mode:** transactions become unverifiable; provenance collapses.\n\n**Tripwires**\n\n* authentication failure rates spike\n* clock drift / timestamp disputes rise\n* supply-chain data becomes non-reconcilable across systems\n\n**Layer 1 — Identity &amp; Agency Interop**\n\n**Purpose:** Define *who/what can act* across borders (humans, firms, agents).  \n**Artifacts:** KYC/AML baselines, beneficial ownership registries, corporate identity, verified credentials, agent authorization logs.  \n**Failure mode:** identity drift → fraud, sanctions leakage, shadow entities.\n\n**Tripwires**\n\n* beneficial-ownership opacity index rises\n* unexplained growth in shell entities / nominee structures\n* cross-jurisdiction identity mismatch rate increases\n\n**Layer 2 — Property, Title, Custody &amp; Provenance**\n\n**Purpose:** Keep “what is owned by whom” legible across jurisdictions.  \n**Artifacts:** land/collateral registries interop, warehousing receipts, shipping bills, securities custody rules, IP registries alignment.  \n**Failure mode:** title uncertainty → credit contraction + conflict over claims.\n\n**Tripwires**\n\n* rising title disputes / collateral perfection failures\n* increasing “goods not as described” claims\n* provenance gaps in critical inputs (chips, pharma, food)\n\n**Layer 3 — Contract Semantics &amp; Choice-of-Law Bridges**\n\n**Purpose:** Make obligations enforceable across borders without rewriting everything.  \n**Artifacts:** standardized clauses, choice-of-law conventions, recognition of judgments, arbitration frameworks, commercial codes harmonization.  \n**Failure mode:** contracts become “local-only”; transaction costs explode.\n\n**Tripwires**\n\n* enforcement time-to-resolution lengthens sharply\n* judgment recognition refusal rates rise\n* arbitration forum overload / politicization signals\n\n**Layer 4 — Audit, Measurement &amp; Disclosure Interop**\n\n**Purpose:** Keep shared maps aligned (financial + operational truth-maintenance without “truth” rhetoric).  \n**Artifacts:** accounting standards bridges (IFRS/GAAP mapping), audit quality norms, ESG/climate disclosure baselines, supply-chain traceability, statistical methods alignment.  \n**Failure mode:** numbers diverge → trust decays → capital reprices abruptly.\n\n**Tripwires**\n\n* restatement frequency increases\n* audit qualification rates rise\n* metric divergence across reporting regimes widens\n\n**Layer 5 — Liability &amp; Externality Allocation**\n\n**Purpose:** Price/assign harms that cross borders (pollution, cyber, contagion, unsafe products).  \n**Artifacts:** product safety regimes, emissions accounting, cross-border tort mechanisms, cyber incident reporting, pandemic coordination protocols.  \n**Failure mode:** unpriced externalities → retaliatory policy + fragmentation.\n\n**Tripwires**\n\n* dispute volume for cross-border harms accelerates\n* insurance exclusions widen suddenly\n* “uninsurable risk” zones expand (shipping, cyber, climate)\n\n**Layer 6 — Financial Plumbing &amp; Crisis Coordination**\n\n**Purpose:** Prevent liquidity and settlement cascades under stress.  \n**Artifacts:** payment rail interop, clearing/settlement rules, resolution regimes, swap lines/contingent liquidity, capital controls playbooks, deposit insurance equivalence discussions.  \n**Failure mode:** freeze events propagate globally (contagion).\n\n**Tripwires**\n\n* settlement fails, margin spirals\n* FX basis blowouts persist\n* cross-border bank funding gaps widen\n\n**Layer 7 — Enforcement Coordination &amp; Sanction Interfaces**\n\n**Purpose:** Coordinate coercion so it doesn’t randomly shatter interop.  \n**Artifacts:** extradition treaties, mutual legal assistance, sanctions compliance standards, export-control regimes, customs enforcement interop.  \n**Failure mode:** compliance becomes impossible; actors choose blocs.\n\n**Tripwires**\n\n* sanctions scope expands faster than compliance capacity\n* seizure/asset-freeze disputes surge\n* “de-risking” accelerates (banks exit corridors)\n\n**Layer 8 — Narrative, Information &amp; Legitimacy Maintenance**\n\n**Purpose:** Sustain consent for the overhead (why people keep paying the entropy bill).  \n**Artifacts:** transparency norms, anti-corruption compacts, election/rights baselines (where applicable), platform governance interfaces, cross-border media standards (limited, contested).  \n**Failure mode:** legitimacy collapse → enforcement costs spike → system reverts to localism.\n\n**Tripwires**\n\n* perceived corruption indices jump\n* trust/legitimacy indicators fall while enforcement intensifies\n* polarization makes shared categories non-portable\n\n**Three “control primitives” that make the stack work**\n\n1. **Canonical registries + cryptographic attestations** (who/what/when)\n2. **Audit loops with escalation ladders** (routine → exceptional → emergency)\n3. **Dispute routing** (local court ↔ arbitration ↔ treaty forum) with bounded timelines\n\n**The core Bridge360 claim**\n\n**Technology increases coupling. Coupling narrows slack.**  \nTo keep dynamics inside the **Spine Corridor**, you either:\n\n* **fund the stack** (continuous verification + dispute handling), or\n* accept **leakage cascades** (fragmentation into blocs, local contracts, higher friction).\n\nIf you tell me which domain you care about most (trade/supply chains, finance, cyber, climate, migration), I’ll instantiate this as a compact “stack blueprint” with: key actors, minimal viable agreements, and 5–10 measurable tripwires for leakage (L) in that domain.\n\nPrompt issued to LLM1:\n\nWorks best with Vapnik’s Weak Convergence Thesis as guide rather than militarist or game-playing adversarial paradigms.\n\nLLM1 response:\n\nYes—the **Global Contract Stack** is structurally closer to **Vapnik-style weak convergence** than to militarist / adversarial game frames.\n\n**Why weak convergence is the right “guide”**\n\nWeak convergence thinking fits because the goal isn’t a single, globally “optimal” system (strong convergence), but **stable corridor behavior in distribution** under perturbations:\n\n* You don’t need every jurisdiction to share the same ontology perfectly.\n* You need the *observable outputs* (settlement reliability, audit comparability, dispute closure, identity portability) to stay within tolerances across many heterogeneous contexts.\n\nThat is exactly a weak-convergence posture: **alignment of distributions of outcomes**, not full alignment of internal models.\n\n**How each stack layer becomes a weak-convergence object**\n\nEach layer can be specified by:\n\n1. a **restricted hypothesis class** (allowed institutional/protocol designs),\n2. **observable metrics** (what “works” looks like),\n3. **tolerance bands** (corridor widths),\n4. **test suites** (stress scenarios + audits),\n5. **update rules** (how standards evolve without breaking interop).\n\nExamples:\n\n* **Identity interop**: target bounded false-accept / false-reject rates across jurisdictions, plus bounded time-to-remediate.\n* **Audit interop**: target bounded divergence between disclosures and realized losses, bounded restatement rates, bounded audit-qualification drift.\n* **Dispute systems**: target bounded time-to-resolution distributions and bounded non-enforcement rates.\n\n**Why militarist / game paradigms underperform for this task**\n\nAdversarial paradigms optimize for *winning against an opponent*, which tends to:\n\n* increase secrecy and deception,\n* drive fragmentation into incompatible stacks,\n* raise verification costs,\n* create correlated failure (bloc cascades).\n\nThat’s high-leakage by design: it pushes the system toward **edge impacts** and brittle regime shifts (your Gorilla-Glass failure mode).\n\n**The practical synthesis**\n\nUse weak convergence as the **governance epistemic rule**:\n\n* “We accept plural internal ontologies; we require convergence of audited, stress-tested outcome distributions within corridor tolerances.”\n\nThen adversarial considerations are relegated to **bounded interfaces** (Layer 7 export controls/sanctions), instead of being the master paradigm.\n\nIf you want, I can express this as a short “Weak-Convergence Governance Charter” for the Global Contract Stack: hypothesis classes per layer, the minimum metric set, and the update/audit cadence that prevents semantic drift.\n\nPrompt issued to LLM1:\n\nWorks with ASI-Human coupling.\n\nLLM1 response:\n\nYes—the weak-convergence–guided **Global Contract Stack** is a natural fit for **ASI–Human coupling**, because it treats the coupling problem as **outcome-stability under distribution shift**, not as “one side wins” or “one ontology rules.”\n\n**Why it fits ASI–Human coupling**\n\n**1) Plural internal models, convergent external behavior**\n\nHumans, institutions, and ASI components will carry different internal representations. Weak convergence says: that’s fine—govern **interfaces and observables**:\n\n* bounded error rates,\n* bounded time-to-correct,\n* bounded dispute load,\n* bounded tail risk under stress tests.\n\nThat’s exactly what you want for ASI: **don’t demand shared meaning; demand corridor-stable outputs.**\n\n**2) The stack becomes the “coupling API”**\n\nEach layer gives ASI and humans a shared control surface:\n\n* **L0–L1**: authenticated identity/authority for agents (who can do what).\n* **L2–L4**: legible commitments and auditable state (what was promised, what happened).\n* **L5–L7**: liability and enforcement routing (what happens when things go wrong).\n* **L8**: legitimacy and consent maintenance (why humans keep participating).\n\nASI can act, but only through auditable, rate-limited, dispute-routable channels.\n\n**What changes when ASI is in the loop (key upgrades)**\n\n**A) “Audit-by-default” interaction logs**\n\nEvery high-impact act needs machine-verifiable:\n\n* authorization chain,\n* data provenance,\n* decision trace at the interface level (not “inner thoughts,” but inputs/outputs + policy handle),\n* rollback/appeals path.\n\n**B) Weak-convergence test suites per layer**\n\nInstead of “prove it’s safe,” you require:\n\n* repeated standardized trials,\n* cross-jurisdiction comparability,\n* stress scenarios,\n* drift detection.\n\n**C) Human override is not a button; it’s a protocol**\n\nOverrides must be:\n\n* scoped (what can be stopped),\n* attributable (who triggered),\n* compensated (how harms are handled),\n* non-abusable (so it doesn’t become factional warfare).\n\n**Minimal coupling spec (practical, short)**\n\nTo couple ASI into global systems without brittle takeover dynamics:\n\n1. **Identity &amp; authority registry for agents** (Layer 1)\n2. **Commitment ledger + provenance** (Layers 2–4)\n3. **Liability and dispute routing** with deadlines (Layers 5–7)\n4. **Continuous weak-convergence monitoring** (all layers)\n5. **Legitimacy maintenance** (Layer 8): transparency sufficient for consent, without requiring full interpretability.\n\n**Bridge360 translation**\n\nASI increases coupling strength and speed—so the corridor narrows unless governance bandwidth rises. The Global Contract Stack is that bandwidth. Weak convergence supplies the rule: *keep the distribution of outcomes inside the Spine Corridor; treat deviations as leakage; trigger bounded interventions.*\n\nIf you name the domain where you care most about ASI–Human coupling (finance, education, cyber, climate response, elections, supply chains), I’ll instantiate a “coupling profile”: the specific observables, tolerance bands, and tripwires for that domain.\n\nPrompt issued to LLM1:\n\nYes—*under a weak-convergence + contract-stack framing*, “humans as entropy sink” can make forecasting **more reliable**, but only in a specific, testable sense: it improves **corridor reliability** of forecasts by damping runaway feedback loops and model drift.\n\n**What “humans as entropy sink” means operationally**\n\nHumans absorb entropy by doing the expensive, dissipative work that pure automation tends to skip or optimize away:\n\n* resolving ambiguity (category disputes, edge cases)\n* adjudicating conflicts (liability, exceptions)\n* rebuilding trust after errors\n* updating norms when the environment shifts\n* injecting “friction” (delays, checks) that prevents cascades\n\nIn the Global Contract Stack, that’s basically: **dispute resolution + legitimacy maintenance + exception handling**.\n\n**Why that improves forecasting reliability**\n\nForecasting fails most often because the target system becomes **reflexive and adversarial**:\n\n* actors game metrics,\n* distributions shift,\n* rare tail events get amplified by tight coupling,\n* feedback signals are suppressed or corrupted.\n\nHuman entropy-sink functions counter those failure modes by:\n\n1. **keeping categories stable** (reducing label drift in identity/property/contract data),\n2. **maintaining audit loops** (reducing hidden accumulation of error),\n3. **limiting cascade speed** (adding selective friction),\n4. **restoring legitimacy after shocks** (preventing regime breaks).\n\nSo you get better **weak convergence**: outcome distributions stay within tolerances more often, which is exactly what makes forecasts “reliable” in practice.\n\n**The key caveat**\n\nHumans only help if they’re positioned as *structured sinks*, not as arbitrary veto:\n\n* sinks must be **protocolized** (who decides, by what procedure, with what audit trail),\n* otherwise humans become noise injectors (politicized overrides, inconsistent exceptions), which *reduces* reliability.\n\n**A crisp restatement you can reuse**\n\n“Forecasting reliability rises when humans function as a governed entropy sink: they absorb ambiguity, resolve disputes, and re-legitimate categories fast enough to keep the system’s outcome distribution inside the corridor, enabling weak-convergence-style stability even under perturbation.”\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a small measurement template: 6–10 observables that quantify “human entropy-sink capacity” (dispute latency, exception rate, audit closure rate, category drift, override frequency, legitimacy indicators) and how each one predicts forecast degradation.\n\nPrompt issued to LLM1:\n\nWhere human cultures, Humanities, count.\n\nLLM1 response:\n\nExactly—**human cultures and the Humanities are the main machinery by which humans act as an entropy sink** at scale.\n\n**What Humanities contribute that forecasting needs**\n\nForecasting becomes more reliable when the system can keep its **categories** stable under stress (identity, obligation, legitimacy, responsibility). Humanities disciplines are basically “category-governance technologies”:\n\n* **History**: supplies analog libraries and regime-shift signatures (how systems fail, how legitimacy collapses, what precedes cascades).\n* **Law / political theory**: formalizes *who owes what to whom* (contracts, rights, liability) and creates routable dispute closure.\n* **Ethics / moral philosophy**: stabilizes norm conflicts (what counts as acceptable trade-offs) so decisions don’t explode into factional war.\n* **Linguistics / rhetoric**: detects framing drift, propaganda, and semantic capture; keeps shared meaning portable across groups.\n* **Anthropology / sociology**: maps local norms and trust structures (what interventions will be adopted vs. rejected).\n* **Literature / narrative studies**: builds legitimacy narratives that make overhead (taxes, audits, compliance) politically survivable.\n\nIn other words: these fields provide the **interpretive and legitimating layer** without which the technical/audit layers become brittle.\n\n**Why “culture” matters specifically**\n\nCulture is the *compression layer* that prevents micro-cracks from turning into fracture:\n\n* It supplies **compliance without constant force** (lower enforcement cost).\n* It enables **trust among strangers** (lower verification cost).\n* It gives **rituals for repair** after shocks (restoring coordination fast).\n\nWhen cultures clash or when a system tries to impose high-fidelity categories without cultural/legitimacy integration, you get:\n\n* category non-portability,\n* audit refusal,\n* enforcement inflation,\n* and then abrupt fragmentation (high leakage).\n\n**Bridge360 + weak convergence synthesis**\n\nFor ASI–Human forecasting, the objective is not perfect shared ontology; it’s **weak convergence of outcomes**. Humanities help by:\n\n* keeping categories and legitimacy within tolerances,\n* providing structured conflict-resolution so model error doesn’t become political rupture,\n* maintaining the “Spine Corridor” when tech coupling tightens.\n\n**A compact line you can reuse**\n\n“**STEM builds the measurement; Humanities build the consent, meaning, and repair loops that make the measurement governable—so forecasts remain corridor-stable.**”\n\nIf you tell me your target domain (national economic planning, education governance, financial risk, climate adaptation), I can translate this into a “Humanities-as-Entropy-Sink” module: concrete roles, institutions, and measurable tripwires.\n\nPrompt issued to LLM1:\n\nEspecially with appropriate Philosophy of Education as with Bridge360 Metatheory Model norms at scale.\n\nLLM1 response:\n\nYes. A Bridge360-aligned **Philosophy of Education** is basically how you *manufacture and maintain* the human “entropy-sink capacity” needed for corridor-stable governance at scale—especially once ASI/LLM coupling tightens linkages.\n\n**What “education as entropy-sink infrastructure” means**\n\nEducation isn’t mainly “content delivery.” It’s the scalable training pipeline for:\n\n* **category discipline** (clean use of identity/property/contract/liability terms),\n* **audit literacy** (records, verification, basic statistics, incentives, fraud models),\n* **dispute competence** (argument norms, due process, reversible decisions),\n* **narrative/legitimacy repair** (keeping cooperation stable after shocks),\n* **anti-sophistry filters** (spotting framing drift and contradiction tolerance failures).\n\nThis is why Humanities + civic formation become load-bearing—not decorative.\n\n**Bridge360 scale architecture: the three competency spines**\n\n**Spine A — Sensemaking &amp; Language Control**\n\nGoal: prevent semantic drift and memetic capture.\n\n* reading comprehension → argument mapping → fallacy detection → “quantifier-clean” claims\n* translation skills across communities (registers, dialects, technical ↔ civic language)\n\n**Outputs:** shared terms stay portable; policy debates remain auditable.\n\n**Spine B — Audit &amp; Measurement Citizenship**\n\nGoal: keep the map synchronized with transactions.\n\n* record-keeping habits, basic accounting, measurement skepticism\n* data provenance, sampling intuition, incentives and Goodhart awareness\n\n**Outputs:** fewer hidden accumulations; earlier detection of leakage.\n\n**Spine C — Governance &amp; Repair Loops**\n\nGoal: make conflict resolvable without fracture.\n\n* due process norms, negotiation, arbitration, restorative practices\n* legitimacy maintenance: how to accept losses without exiting the system\n\n**Outputs:** disputes close; enforcement costs don’t explode.\n\n**How this couples to ASI/LLMs**\n\nLLMs can amplify speed and reach, but they also amplify:\n\n* semantic slippage,\n* performative metrics,\n* narrative cascades.\n\nSo education must train citizens and operators to function as:\n\n* **validators** (audit/verification),\n* **interpreters** (meaning/intent),\n* **brakes** (selective friction),\n* **repair crews** (post-error legitimacy restoration).\n\nThat’s the human role that keeps weak-convergence stability possible.\n\n**Minimal “at-scale” design principle**\n\nDon’t try to make everyone a theorist. Make most people **corridor-maintainers**:\n\n* able to read claims critically,\n* able to keep records,\n* able to participate in dispute resolution,\n* able to resist memetic coercion.\n\n**One-sentence Bridge360 formulation**\n\n“A Bridge360 philosophy of education is a national-scale entropy-sink program: it trains distributed humans to preserve category fidelity, sustain audit loops, and execute repair under stress so the coupled ASI–human system stays inside the Spine Corridor.”\n\nIf you want, I can turn this into a concrete blueprint for a school system (K–12–tertiary–civil service) with measurable outcomes and tripwires (category drift, audit failure rates, dispute backlog, legitimacy indicators).\n\nUse this url to view the entire conversation.\n\n[https://chatgpt.com/share/69941456-b4e8-8004-8f8e-5594f42b98e7](https://chatgpt.com/share/69941456-b4e8-8004-8f8e-5594f42b98e7)\n\nBackgrounder here.

    "text": "So:\n\n\\- No, they are not drag queens here. They are on their own personas.\n\n\\- It is all the DCAS cast, with the exception of Fiore(which i subbed out with Dan). This was done with the Drag Race simulator site!\n\n\\- This takes a long time to read, so i would recommend doing it only if you have time to spend and if you are the target audience for this post!! Thanks, have a good read!\n\n\n\n**EPISODE 1**\n\nFirst challenge: Do an outfit utilizing winter items. Jake and Lake won a mini-challenge about knowing the rest of the cast and had a advantage to grab the items 30 seconds before everyone else.\n\n\\- Aiden does a sickening red suit, and design some really well done pants in a span of a day. Aiden helped Lake with some of her stuff after finishing his outfit.\n\n\\- Grett also does an excellent job, creating a beautiful christmas gown. She was overly confident while doing the challenge and stood her ground.\n\n\\- Tom's outfit is a clear worst of the week, by a good margin. A manifactured shirt with shorts and a silly headpiece. Looked very unfinished and sloppily put together.\n\n/\n\n\\- In untucked, Lake and Miriam are clearly unhappy with the way Ashley portrayed herself while sewing her outfit. She defends herself with the fact she was very anxious while doing the challenge and apologizes.\n\n\\- Tess also looks slightly bummed to not be on the top this week, but nothing too important,\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Ellie, Aiden, Jake, Grett and Gabby. Aiden ends up taking the win, leaving a very surprised Grett on the stage.\n\nHe also has a immunity for next weeks challenge.\n\nLows of the week: Alec, Dan, Tom and Hunter, Alec and Hunter are saved, since their outfits weren't too bad, just very safe and boring. Dan and Tom are the bottom 2 and will lipsync to Starman, by David Bowie. Tom ends up DUSTING Dan and sends him home, since he won the lipsync and has way more storylines brewing.\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 2**\n\nSecond challenge: The contestants will improvise in a mexican telenovela. Lake wins an arts-n-crafts mini challenge, so she gets to pick her role first.\n\n\\- Yul, Hunter, Tess and Grett are the clear bests. Yul clearly impresses the rest of the cast with his ability to actually contain his nerves during the challenge and deliver his lines perfectly(They all still hate him, though). Tess and Hunter had great chemistry with one another and bounced off each other with excellence. Grett is just... good at everything, i guess.\n\n\\- Gabby is the only contestant to do bad on the challenge. She surprisingly missed some lines and was clearly inside her own head.\n\n\\- The runway was Zodiac Sign, an outfit representing and glamourizing your sign. Aubrey would be proud... Grett(Scorpio), Riya(Aquarius), Ally(Also Scorpio) and Gabby(Aries) had the best runways of the week, no one did badly.\n\n/\n\n\\- In untucked, Riya and Connor bond about their lives outside of the competition.\n\n\\- We also had a moment of Alec, Tom and Ellie talking within themselves about how Lake was very underwhelming and should have been in the bottom.\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Yul, Hunter, Tess and Grett. Grett and Hunter both get a win, being rewarded for different reasons. Grett had a near perfect week. Yul really does not look happy to not have won.\n\nLows of the week: Gabby, Ashley, Aiden and Ally. Aiden has immunity and is saved, and Ally, while having a similar level of performance with Ashley, had a clearly better runway.\n\nGabby and Ashley are the bottom 2 and lipsync to Celebrity Skin, by Hole. Both are very awkward and the lipsync feels janky and unfulfilling. Gabby actually trips in the middle of the song, giving the win to Ashley kinda by default and being our second eliminated here.\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 3**\n\nThird challenge: The contestants have to do a comedy routine about Heaven and Hell. Tess wins a drawing mini challenge and gets to choose the order which the participants perform.\n\n\\- Miriam blows everyone OUT OF THE WATER. She gets a perfect mix of comedy and melancholy talking about her experiences, making her show not only hilarious, but extremely powerful too. Everyone judging is slightly teary-eyed at the end of the presentation, even Derek. Alec, Jake, Riya, Connor and Yul also do great on the challenge.\n\n\\- No one does bad on this week.\n\n\\- On the runway, the category is fascinator: An outfit that complements your own decorative headpiece. Riya, Lake, Tess and Grett(Again...) all serve immensely on their looks, while Ellie and Tom had the weakest runways.\n\n/\n\n\\- In untucked, we have two big fights: Yul and Ellie vs Tom and Yul vs Lake. Yul mostly instigating and annoying everyone, and Ellie being quite frustrated that Gabby was no longer in the competition.\n\n\\- Yul feels he should have been on the top. AGAIN.\n\n\\- Ellie adds that she hates Riyas fake ass style, and that she portrays herself in a completely different way in front of the judges.\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Alec, Connor, Miriam and Jake. Miriam obviously takes the win.\n\nLows of the week: Hunter, James, Aiden and Grett. Grett and Hunter are IMMUNE from last week. Sadly that means we will have a Jaiden lipsync on episode 3. Yummy for the drama.\n\nThey lipsync to I Hate Everything About You, by Three Days Grace. James knew how much Aiden wanted to win the competition and did not try on the slightest to beat him, being eliminated because of that. At the end of the lipsync, they share a kiss, and Riya catches A LOT of strays on the lipsync.\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 4**\n\nFourth challenge: They will have a ball!! The categories are Secret Identity(brought from home, weight 5) and Superhero vs Supervillain. Tess gets a huge advantage for winning this weeks mini-challenge, that being utilizing every material and fabric she wanted, without having to run to get a specific ammount.\n\n\\- Ellie does a BRILLIANT job this week. Her look brought from home, while crafty, was extremely clever, and the one she made on the workroom was inspired on fiction heroines and villains, having a 50/50 style with Poison Ivy and Ren, from Star Wars. She is extremely praised for her creativity and for actually turning the look out.\n\n\\- Tess and Lake both do extremely well too, Tess with a wonderful flowy black gown and Lake with a pretty catsuit and some of the best makeup done in that season.\n\n\\- Hunter struggles. While flunking his first design challenge, it wasn't that bad. His garment here is just... Nothing. It does not feel conected to the theme in hand at all. Ally tries to help him, to no avail.\n\n/\n\n\\- In untucked, Jake and Alec have a huge fight about how Jake has quite the attitude with Alec, to which the older man absolutely dismisses and attacks Jake on being a liar.\n\n\\- Not too much time after, we surprisingly have Jake and Yul have a bonding moment of all people, listening to the lipsync song this week together.\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Ellie, Tess, Miriam, Lake and Aiden. Ellie takes the win, feeling VERY validated.\n\nLows of the week: Hunter, Riya, Tom and Ashley. Riya is quite shocked to be on the bottom, but she ends up being saved, together with Tom. Both Ashley and Hunter have been underperforming this competition, and it was catching to them.\n\nLipsyncing to 7 Rings by Ariana Grande and feeling the pressure of elimination, they both turn it out. Ashley was flying throughout the stage, Hunter was breaking some of the cleanest dance moves ever seen. If this was between stronger contestants, it would have been a double shantay for sure, but sadly we will have to say bye to Ashley here. Leaving in a extremely high note.\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 5**\n\nIn the fifth challenge, they have to nail a photoshoot in a graveyard, model realness. Riya won a mini challenge quiz about cinema, no advantage given.\n\n\\- Mostly everyone turns it out, with the exception of Riya and Jake. Riya was feeling extremely sick on the idea and does just an okay job, clearly out of her game. Jake is... not pleased the photoshoot is in a cemetery. He completely bombs the challenge.\n\n\\- On the runway, the category is country: An outfit resembling the countryside. Grett and Lake have impeccable outfits, Tom and Alec... not so much.\n\n/\n\n\\- NOTHING happened in untucked. Aiden and Tom bonded, i guess.\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Grett, Tess, Yul, Ellie and Miriam. Grett takes her second win home, thanks to her gorgeous runway. Tess also wins, having the perfect vibe for the photoshoot and taking gorgeous photos.\n\nLows of the week: Jake, Alec and Riya. Riya faints while the deliberations are occuring, and is treated right after. Thankfully, she is ready to continue in the competition. Alec is saved because he did great in the challenge, just his runway brought him down.\n\nThey lipsync to DEATH, by Melanie Martinez. Jake is able to easily outperform a sickened Riya and sends her home, putting an end in one of the most forgotten villain runs on herstory.\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 6**\n\nSixth challenge: The contestants have to act in a parody film called Phone Apps(Lucky bastards).\n\n\\- Lake, Yul and Alec have some all-time great performances on the challenge. Playing the bad guys, Yul and Alec were absolutely hysterical and showered with praises, while Lake served a more soft and smart approach to her character, which also worked.\n\n\\- No one does badly.\n\n\\- On the runway, the category is pageant realness. Yul and Grett are both really above the others on how well structured were their looks. Connors look is an extremely boring take on it.\n\n/\n\nOn untucked, Aiden and Ellie have a beautiful conversation about mental health.\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Lake, Yul, Alec and Miriam. Yul finally takes his first win home, inflating his already huge ego. He is not immune in the next week, though. This ends in this week.\n\nLows of the week: Grett, Ally and Tom. Grett being saved by immunity, we have Tom and Ally in the bottom. Both with no great performances yet...\n\nThey lipsync to Telephone, by Lady Gaga. Ally does the bare minimum to win against a very underwhelming Tom, sadly eliminating our favorite himbo. This hopefully makes her wake it up.\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 7**\n\n7th challenge: The contestants have to do comedy sketches(SNL style). Jake wins a funny bridge-building mini challenge and gets to choose his rule.\n\n\\- Miriam gags everyone again with how good of an actor she is. Nails every single joke on her set, cementing herself as a huge frontrunner. Jake is especially happy for her.\n\n\\- Everyone does well, but Tess, Ally and Ellie are the clear bottom 3 of the week.\n\n\\- On the runway, the category is feathers: A look made of/that includes feathers on it. Ellie has a beautiful, timeless look. Hunter serves absolutely nothing realness.\n\n/\n\nOn untucked, Alec, Yul, Hunter and Jake get into a fight with one another involving placements. Yul also expresses how unhappy he is to know that Grett is safe.\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Lake, Connor and Miriam. Miriam takes the win after another convincing performance, having by far the best performance.\n\nLows of the week: Ally, Ellie and Tess. All of them were fine on the challenge, and Ellie outshone the other two on the runway. Sadly, we will have a Tessally lipsync too, tragic...\n\nThey lipsync to Running Back To You, by Vanessa Williams. Both do fine and its a really sad lipsync, since they are really close friends, but in this case Tess track record is the deciding factor. Sadly, we lost Ally :(\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 8**\n\n8th challenge: Runway! The category is Fashion Week Extravaganza!\n\n\\- Both Yul and Grett hate each other. Like, a lot. But it is getting very clear to everyone their rivalry only thrives because of how GOOD both of them are. Yul had a futuristic ice coloured look, fresh out of a Met Gala. Grett was looking absolutely stunning once again, but changing the silhouette, with a beautiful fiery puffer jacket to complement the rest of a beautiful dress.\n\n\\- Everyone did decently, Connor and Aiden being a clear bottom 2. Both good looks, they just lacked any sort of pizzazz the other outfits had.\n\n/\n\n\\- In untucked, Lake and Hunter bond over his stupid cards, and they actually have a lot of fun. Lake also expresses how annoyed she is at Ellie, since the girl was complaining about being safe.\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Tess, Yul and Grett. While Tess comeback was great, she had no chance against the other two. Grett does come out on top in the end, getting the win over Yul, and GREATLY annoying him.\n\nLows of the week: Aiden and Connor. :(\n\nThey lipsync to Jailhouse Rock, by Elvis Presley. Connor is clearly showing why he is not on a prime age to dance anymore, and a sad Aiden ends up destroying him in the lipsync. They share a hug before Connors departure.\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 9**\n\n9th challenge: They do a satirical musical performance of some of the most iconic Disventure Camp moments. Yul wins the mini challenge, which involved guessing the celebrity. The challenge was done in teams, but it will be judged individually.\n\n1st team: Tess, Miriam, Alec and Lake. The more experienced team does mostly great, with Lake being the weak link(but still doing okay).\n\n2nd team: Aiden, Jake and Ellie. They just fought the whole way through, mostly with artistical differences. Jake and Ellie delivered solid performances, Aiden... kinda bombed. Just kinda lost overall.\n\n3rd team: Hunter, Grett and Yul. Grett and Yul fighting. A LOT. They HATE each others guts, Yul being especially mad for not winning the last challenge, and Hunter being just there, like the silly man he is. Yul and Hunter do great, Grett suffers to get the singing down and does not deliver her best performance yet.\n\n\\- The runway was double trouble: 2 looks in one! Aiden has the best look of the season yet, a look that explained his hardships on life, especially after coming out as trans. No bad looks on this runway.\n\n/\n\n\\- Nothing happens in untucked. Hunter and Jake mostly exist there, and Hunter admits he finds the boy interesting. Jake reciprocates the feeling, but the room atmosphere is very awkward.\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Tess, Ellie, Alec and Yul. Surprisingly, Tess gets a win here. Her performance just being really good around the edges.\n\nLows of the week: Grett, Lake and Aiden. Aiden gets saved last minute because of his runway. Grett and Lake are in the bottom, in what could be considered her worst day in the competition.\n\nThey lipsync to Head to Toe, by Lisa Lisa. Both do not excel at lipsync, being at best, kinda uninteresting, but that is enough excuse to save Grett and send a middle of the pack Lake home, sadly.\n\n\\-\n\nSo, middle of the competition! Lets see the chance some of these contestants have to win the whole thing:\n\nFrontrunners: Miriam, Yul, Grett.\n\nRunning behind: Tess, Ellie.\n\nJust okay: Alec, Jake.\n\nIn active danger: Aiden, Hunter.\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 10**\n\nOn the 10th challenge, they are doing the Match Game! The contestants are impersonating famous personalities!\n\n\\- Miriam absolutely shines through, again. She impersonates Lucille Ball and by her last joke, Trevor is bawling on the ground from laughing too much.\n\n\\- Ellie as Regina George, Hunter as Jim Carrey and Jake as Percy Jackson also do really good performances.\n\n\\- The rest is fine.\n\n\\- The runway category is rollerskates: An outfit that integrates...rollerskates. No duds, but no real great looks.\n\n/\n\n\\- In untucked, Tess says to Ellie that she does not think she should have been safe, probably on the top. Ellie sadly agrees, but say this type of stuff is with the judges and that they cannot change it.\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Miriam, Jake and Hunter. Miriam unsurprisingly takes it home again.\n\nLows of the week: Yul, Alec and Aiden. The judges were honestly over Aiden at this point. He peaked at episode 1 and has been underperforming since then. Following this logic, they want the best to just send him home already, so they save Alec. Yul is NOT thrilled, and lashes out on stage before the lipsync, getting a verbal warning from Emily to not do that.\n\nThey lipsync to Tainted Love by Gloria Jones, and as expected, Yul does outperform Aiden, who has a depressing end to his [run.Now](http://run.Now) everyone nows that Yul is a great performer, and that Miriam is by far the frontrunner now.\n\n\\- \n\n**EPISODE 11**\n\nOn the 11th challenge, they are doing a parody commercial about pilots. Jake gets chosen by the wheel to choose his team for the challenge.\n\nTeam Jake: Jake, Miriam, Tess and Ellie. Tess delivers an okay performance, the others DESTROY the challenge. They are incredibly funny, and bring a very fresh concept of a pilot about... pilots.\n\nTeam Leftovers: Hunter, Grett, Yul and Alec. Yul and Alec did good, the others were okay. It was a fine team, just nothing compared to the craziness that was the first one. \n\nThe runway was Loss of generations: A chic look that gives CEO realness. Yul had an insane runway package, and it showed. Another huge hit. Hunter had the worst look, sadly, just a very crunchy and out of touch fashion taste.\n\n/\n\n\\- Nothing on untucked, just Alec is there.\n\n/\n\nHigh team: Miriam, Ellie, Jake and Tess. Ellie takes the win home here to keep the concept of someone other than Miriam having a slight chance to win.\n\nLows of the week: Yul, Grett and Hunter. Yul was by far the best of the three and is saved, putting Grett to lipsync against Hunter.\n\nThey lipsync to Escapism by RAYE. Hunter delivers the best lipsync performance of the season, with Grett doing just okay on it, but then, some riggory was needed to keep this show alive. Grett has a way better track record than Hunter, and serves more drama. Because of that, they sadly end up sending Hunter home, but going with a blast!\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 12**\n\nBefore the 12th, we have a incredible scene: Miriam slapping Yul after he made a derogatory comment towards Grett. The boy is FUMING, but does not reciprocate it.\n\nThe 12th challenge was designing and hosting their own room with a Saw Trap(With safety measures, of course).\n\n\\- Jake, Grett, Miriam and Ellie all understood the assignment perfectly, and did a great job on it. Jake looked especially happy and excited presenting it.\n\n\\- You know who did not do a great job? Yul. He FLOPPED. HARD. Fumbled over his own lines, his room design was bad, his trap was bad, his jokes were not funny. Miriam slapping him did some DAMAGE, let me tell you. Alec also underperformed badly, just not at Yuls extent. Second clearest bottom 2 of the season (Behind Aiden x Connor).\n\n\\- The runway theme was hair: A look involving, yk, hair. Go WILD. Grett and Tess served some beautiful looks with LONG hair, they looked absolutely stunning. No one did badly, but Yul had the weakest look too. Just not his week.\n\n/\n\n\\- In untucked, Grett is just chiiilling, with a smile on her face. She knows what is coming.\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Miriam, Jake and Ellie. Jake is given a very nice win here, on what could maybe be seen as a swan song? Not like he didn't deserve his win.\n\nLows of the week: Tess, Alec and Yul. Yeah, Tess got slightly hurt by the rules, but she was swiftly saved. Alec and Yul in the bottom.\n\nThey lipsync to Shape of You by Ed Sheeran. Alec is old and suffers from Connorism: No ability to dance at all. Yul runs laps around him, in what could be considered a blowout lipsync. Its over for our old dog :(\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 13**\n\nBefore the 13th challenge, we actually can see some type of tension between Ellie and Grett, unknown reason.\n\nThe 13th is a choreo challenge about the history of Disco. Jake had won a mini challenge where you have to impersonate your fellow contestants using puppets. Everyone does decently well and the air on the work room gets lighter.\n\n\\- Yul was mad of doing bad on the last few weeks, and a dance challenge was the perfect opportunity to shine. And he did, sadly. Clear best of the week.\n\n\\- Grett misses some steps, everyone else does okay to good.\n\n\\- On the runway, the theme was blue. And yet again, Tess served an absolute masterpiece of a look. No one did badly.\n\n/\n\nNo untucked\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Yul, Jake and Miriam. Yul takes the win, unceremoniously, to the contempt of everyone else on that stage.\n\nLows of the week: Tess, Ellie and Grett. Grett was the clear bottom, but Tess had an actual great look, while Ellies was just good. Grett and Ellie are in the bottom...\n\nThey lipsync to Dancing Queen by ABBA. Sadly, Grett did crash and burn in the competition :( This lipsync being the perfect example, because Ellie was actually lipsyncing for her life. Splits, dips, emotion. Grett was not feeling it, and we lost one of our early frontrunners. Really really tragic, especially because it was on the same week that guy won. Just brutal.\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 14**\n\nThe 14th challenge is a dance challenge about rival clubs(I AM NOT THE ONE DECIDING IT, ITS THE SIMULATOR...)\n\n\\- Yul is really happy, but slightly weirded out about having 2 dance challenges in a row. Well, unsurprisingly, he absolutely blows everyone out of the water.\n\n\\- Miriam is VERY frustrated, because she was suffering. Just way too old to keep up with one dance challenge after the other. She does terribly, and looks very tired. Her and Ellie are the clear two worsts of the week.\n\n\\- The runway theme was circus: A look inspired/made within the circus vibe! Guess what? Tess again. Just a machine of great looks. The best runway contestant with Grett.\n\n/ \n\nNo untucked\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Yul, Jake, Tess. Yul taking his second win in a row!\n\nLows of the week. Ellie, Miriam. Honestly, every bottom here is going to be really shocking from now.\n\nThey lipsync to I Drove All Night by Celine Dion. Both with completely different approaches, Miriam treated it like a ballad, Ellie treated it like an energetic song. Miriams approach + track record were a little more exciting, which does mean we are losing the biggest underdog on the season. Definitely my favorite contestant run this season, really sad she did not get into the finale.\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 15**\n\nBefore the top 4 challenge, Tess just express she is really sad with Ellies elimination, and that they were really close. All the other ones agree, even if they did not like her that much.\n\nThe top 4 challenge involves the contestants doing solo lipsyncs in front of the judges, trying to guarantee a spot in the top 3.\n\n\\- Everyone does well, but Miriam is slightly behind the others. No runway this episode.\n\n/\n\nNo untucked\n\n/\n\nHighs of the week: Tess and Jake. Tess ends up taking the win, which was a nice change of pace from her!!\n\nLows of the week: Miriam and Yul. A season long rivalry finally coming to an end, in this top 4 lipsync. Miriam and Yul in the bottom.\n\nThey lipsync to All The Rage Back Home by Interpol. Both with strong interpretations of the song, no one doing too good on the lipsync. After some deliberation... 'Miriam, shantay, you stay', and end of the line to the biggest villain this program have ever seen. Only the queen was capable of slaying the dragon.\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 16**\n\nThis top 3 is extremely united, and they all really like each other. Jake and Miriam getting this far together is especially heartwarming.\n\nThe top 3 challenge is an interview with Emily, but they are the reporters. Tess won a mini-challenge about making the smallest t-shirt in 10 minutes.\n\n\\- They all do great. Pretty equal performances.\n\n\\- The runway theme is dove: A white look that resembles peace! They all do great. Pretty equal runways.\n\n\\- Tess wins the challenge, to reward how great her end of the season was. Just insanely locked in. But...\n\nThis was obviously to do the Miriam-Jake lipsync in the top 3. They lipsync to Hot Hot by Bree Runway. Jake feels extremely defeated and does not do well on the lipsync on purpose. Miriam does the bare minimum and goes to comfort Jake mid-lipsync, in what could be considered a pretty depressing scene to watch. Miriam is announced the winner shortly after everything ends and they share a huge hug(Kinda of a Yarlexis lipsync moment to those that watched dr).\n\n\\-\n\n**EPISODE 17**\n\nFINALE TIME!!\n\nThey both do their own presentations, and both turn it out! They have an interview with Trevor about everything that transpired until now, from the beginning of the season to now. On how Tess had to send her best friend home. On how Miriam had to send her best friend, almost son home. On how both of them had some insanely great challenge performances or great runways, and that they were both great foils to each other.\n\n\n\nOn the runway, the category is: Best look. Both crushed the runway and served some beautiful, extremely well-constructed gowns.\n\n\n\nOn the lipsync for the crown, they lipsync to Welcome to New York, by Taylor Swift. Both have decently good performances, the best you can do to a Taylor Swift song on a gown!! And after the lipsync ends.\n\n\n\nEmily announces the winner. And that is\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTESS!! Now prance, my queen! After a huge nice run, she turned it out even if she was not a frontrunner on the middle portion of the competition. Thanks to everyone that read everything and is a huge NERD like me, i loved writing it! Deuces!!",

    "text": "10. Rams @ Panthers (NFC Wild Card): What was expected to be a blowout turned into a competitive game. Coker had us coked out when Young completed a pass late in the fourth to him in the back of the endzone to take a 31-27 lead. However, the Panthers defense folded and Stafford threw what would be the game winning pass to Parkinson (an incredible catch). The moment was too much for Bryce Young and the receivers, whose drops and panic could not allow for a comeback. Oh yeah, and DeVantae Adams got smacked so hard his tongue was bleeding.\n\n9. Chiefs @ Jaguars (Week 5): Does anyone remember this epic? Mahomes made some absolutely incredible plays to Kelce, but this was the Jaguars game. Devon Lloyd’s 99-yd Pick Six changed the momentum, but it was heroics from Lawrence that saved the game. An incredible third-down conversion to Travis Hunter dazzled viewers, while Lawrence, who tripped on the goalline, got up stumbling, and ran it into a TD, all while Chris Jones watched without effort (ultimately summarizing the chiefs season). Four lead changes in the final quarter to top it.\n\n8. Rams @ Eagles (Week 3): A classic on an early Sunday afternoon… uh, yes please. Stafford and the Rams offense dominated Philly in the first half after a quick Baun interception spotted Philly 7. Despite their red zone defense holding strong, it looked like the Eagles were dead in the water. However, down 26-7, the Eagles passing game exploded. AJ Brown with over 100 2nd-half yards, and Hurts with 4 third-down/fourth-down conversions gave the Eagles a 1-point lead. Jordan Davis blocks the game-winning kick (following Jalen Carter’s block 2 dives earlier), completing the first NFL game with 2 blocked Field Goals in 17 years!\n\n7. Steelers @ Ravens (Week 18): One of the strangest games of the season. Two teams compete for the kings of trash hill (aka The AFC North) on a Sunday Night Game in Pittsburg. Due to a chaotic fourth quarter of blown coverages and chunk plays, the game went from a defensive slog to a massive shootout. Aaron Rodgers gave it his all while Lamar Jackson and Zay Flowers made some incredible magic. However, the game will forever be defined by Loop’s game-loosing missed FG (down 2 off a missed XP from Pittsburg).\n\n6. Rams @ Bears (NFC Divisional): A cold defensive slog in Chicago may not sound like a fun time on paper, but when your QBs are the MVP Stafford and the red-hot Caleb Williams, you’re destined for a great time. The best play of the NFL season happened on a 4th-down game tying Touchdown that took the game into OT. Despite the Rams forcing a 3-and-out off a questionable run-concept on 3rd and 1, Williams’ interception cost them the game. Sometimes, fate giveth and fate taketh away.\n\n5. Ravens @ Bills (Week 1): Josh Allen down 15 in the fourth? No problem. This game had a ton of impressive moments, including Hopkin’s one handed Touchdown and Ed Oliver’s peanut punch on Henry. Two of the league’s premier QBs sling it in a September game to open the season… even the haters gonna love it.\n\n4. Packers @ Bears (NFC Wild Card): The best comeback of the season. The bears down 21-3 at the half, and 21-6 in the 3rd scored 25 points in the fourth quarter. Packers Special Team issues and vanilla offensive playcalling sunk their ship while Caleb Williams had a defining moment on a fourth-and-eight completion to Odunze. The league’ oldest rivalry in the playoffs + an epic comeback, I am sorry cheeseheads, this one will hurt for a while.\n\n3. Bills @ Broncos (AFC Divisional): The two best teams in the conference battled on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Josh Allen’s 4-turnovers were the defying moments of the game, and yet still had a chance in OT. The catch/interception controversy is still debated by Bills and Broncos fans to this day. The game was extremely competitive with some great plays by both teams. Even if Bo’s injury dampered what could have been a championship run, this game itself was proof they were not frauds (I was a Nix hater but not anymore lol).\n\n2. Packers @ Bears (Week 16): The tides had finally changed. A Bears team that had relied on a dominating offensive line and running game showed their QB has some magic too. Down 16-6, the Bears scored 10 straight in the 4th, including a completed onside kick. The forced fumble and game winner deep ball to DJ Moore at extremely memorable moments. Bonus points for a divisional rivalry.\n\n1. Rams @ Seahawks (Week 16): Sam Darnold comes back from a 16-point deficit after the Seahawks defense gave up 150 yards to Puka (who would finish with over 200) and 30 points. The Seahawks completed 3 straight 2-point conversions, one of them off a very rare mishap and another on a game winner to Saubert.",

    "text": "Hey Spikes,\n\nLast season I made a[ post](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1qet816/standard_bw_token_control_an_endofseason_dadspike/) about a WB Token control.\n\nI decided to stick with it this season and wanted to put out my guide a little earlier for anyone who wants to take it for a spin for the last couple weeks of the season. Strap in, because it’s time for another long-ass, spike-friendly rogue deck post. In this guide I’ll go over the theory behind this deck, the matchup data and thoughts on popular matchups, sideboard plans, and things to think about going forward.\n\n[**Decklist for this Testing**](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/7623122#paper)\n\n[**New Changes I’m Trying**](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/7626966#paper)\n\n**Changes from Last Season**\n\n**Maindeck:** \\-2 Dusk Rose Reliquary, -1 Beyond the Quiet, -1 Scavenger’s Talent, -1 Swamp. +1 Tragic Trajectory, +2 Day of Judgement, 1 Elspeth, Storm Slayer, +1 Realm of Koh (this one is free, can’t believe I didn’t have it before).\n\n**Sideboard:** \\-1 Astrelli Reclaimer, -1 Beyond the Quiet, -1 Aang’s Iceberg, -1 Ketramose, -2 Day of Judgement, -1 Tragic Trajectory. +2 Requiting Hex, +1 Dusk Rose Reliquary, +1 The End, +2 Torpor Orb, +1 Scavenger’s Talent\n\n**Theorycrafting**\n\nBuilding a competitive rogue deck is all about identifying exploitable things in meta decks and then having a plan to be good against decks that are targeting public enemy #1.\n\nThe idea for this deck originated after PT Avatar with the thought that a deck that could maindeck Requisition Raid and graveyard hate would be good at targeting Lessons and the popular graveyard decks in the format. That idea worked out pretty well. Does it still work now? I think so, even though our target deck has changed.\n\nLooking at the current format, I don’t think there are any 1 mana cards in the conversation of being format-warping. Maybe Llanowar Elves. Maybe Gran-Gran. So moving up to two mana, Cub is the most powerful thing to do, so we start there.\n\nWe have the obvious plan for Cub and aggressive/midrange decks - removal, sweepers, and card advantage. The maindeck changes reflect that, going up to the full four copies of Day of Judgement and Tragic Trajectory, as well as adding some Requitting Hex to the board. Trimming Dusk Rose gives us less game against Monument, Enduring Curiosity, and some other relevant cards, but I think it’s the correct metagame call at the moment.\n\nKnowing that other decks targeting Cub are doing the same thing, we want to construct our deck to be good against spot removal and sweepers, which the enchantment package does nicely. We can play a long game against controlling decks and, unlike most sweeper decks, actually build a board without losing the card advantage game to a sweeper.\n\nThe other archetype to consider is the combo or big-mana decks that are trying to go over the top. These decks are best against our slow, grindy gameplan without counterspells or instant speed interaction. Fortunately, many of these decks in this format use the graveyard, which we have some maindeck interaction for. They’re our worst matchup and need sideboard consideration.\n\n**Why Play This Deck?**\n\nSee above, kinda. In short, I think this deck has a very favorable matchup against Cub variants, is fine against decks that play a lot of interaction to target Cub, and we get to play some blowout-potential sideboard cards in our main deck because we raise their floor. The deck has generally been good against various brews as well. \n\nAre we “just a worse Jeskai or UW Control Deck?” Almost certainly, but I am having a lot of fun playing these cards. One thing I like is we have a low curve and don’t need to cast 5-7 mana spells to turn the corner. Having that many lands helps though. See last season’s [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/1qet816/standard_bw_token_control_an_endofseason_dadspike/) for some basic playpatterns, which are largely unchanged.  \n  \n**Matchup Data, Current Metagame Thoughts.**\n\nHere’s my competitive matchup spread and some general thoughts about common matchups since PT Lorwyn. On Lorwyn release, I thought Formidable Speaker Reanimator decks were going to be more consistent and good, and I maindecked four Soul Guide Lanterns on Day 1. I didn’t really see many, and since the PT where its winrate was awful, I haven’t seen it at all really.\n\nCub is still the biggest target that must be considered in deckbuilding IMO, but Lorwyn’s additions of Requiting Hex, Spell Snare, and Sunderflock are new tools to keep it in check, and they’re prevalent. I don’t think Cub will ever get completely hated out of the format because the power level of it is so high. We may continue to see less of it, less linear builds of it, and more games against decks that target it. \n\nI barely see Lessons anymore (once in my last 57 matches, somehow), although some recent challenges have seen a lot of Lessons in the top four slots. We’re in decent shape for that shift if it happens.\n\n**Match winrate vs. Meta Decks: 20-15 (57%)**\n\n**Cub Variants (7-2), very favored**\n\nGx Landfall: 3-1\n\nUGx Ouro: 1-1\n\nGB Ouro with Roots: 1-0\n\nGB Ouro No Roots: 1-0\n\n5c Rhythm: 1-0\n\nThoughts: We did the thing we set out to do and beat up on the Cub decks with our “anti-Lessons and graveyard” brew. I love this game. The new red splash Landfall decks will be considerably better against us, but I haven’t played one yet.\n\n**Control Variants: (5-5), slightly favored**\n\nJeskai Control: 3-1\n\nUW Control: 1-2\n\nUB Control: 0-1\n\nUB Excruciator: 1-0\n\nUR Lessons: 0-1 (I also played a match with my new changes list and got a win here)\n\nThoughts: Can I call Lessons a control deck? My one match against Lessons they curved Talent+Basics into Ral both games, which we don’t deal with very well and is extremely rare. I enjoy playing the Jeskai matchup a lot (more detail in the sideboard section), and I do think we’re even to favored against the control variants as a whole, even though they got a massive upgrade against us with Spell Snare. We no longer have a guaranteed Voice of Victory on turn 2 on the play.\n\nWe have an interesting angle against Excruciator where we can shut off their combo win by having a Scavenger’s Talent and stuff to sacrifice in play. One of the losses to UW was against a build that had Spirit Water Revival, which was too much to beat. Against more common builds I think we do fine.\n\n**Interactive Aggressive Decks: (2-4), unfavored**\n\nUW Tempo: 0-1\n\nUB Midange: 2-3\n\nThoughts: It makes sense that we’re unfavored against these decks - pressure that we can’t block and disruption. I’m not sure how I would ever win a game, let alone a match against the 4 Aven Interrupter 4 Aang deck, so I’m just going to pretend it doesn’t exist or play something else if it becomes popular. Maybe a combination of Torpor Orb and Voice of Victory would be enough to contend in sideboarded games.  \n  \nThe UB matchup felt better last season, and that maindeck had four Dusk Rose Reliquary in it. The UB lists that I’ve been playing have more flyers than they used to. I am seeing this deck a lot, so I may want to consider some maindeck or sideboard changes. We need this matchup to be better if we’re going to be a competitive deck. I highrolled pretty hard in my most recent match against UB; this one could easily be a 1-4.\n\n**Burn-Focused Aggressive Decks: (2-0), slightly favored**\n\nR Aggro: 1-0\n\nWR Aggro: 1-0\n\nThoughts: The Obsessive Pursuit plan is not the best here. Requitting Hex has been relevant every time I’ve drawn it. Having it in the 75 is a big upgrade for us against decks like this.\n\n**Elemental and Dragon Midrange: (4-2), not sure yet.**\n\nUBGx Elementals: 1-2\n\nWR Dragons: 1-0\n\nUR Spells Elementals: 2-0\n\nThoughts: I grouped these together because they are midrange decks that maindeck hate cards that are good against us. I would prefer to never see the card Wistfulness again and live a peaceful life with my stupid durdle enchantments. I added two Torpor Orbs for this deck because I think we’re able to deal with cheap vanilla idiots, but can’t really deal with double Wistfulness and Deceit triggers. On the other side, Clarion Conquerer is annoying and the whole deck flies over us, but I think this matchup is winnable. The matches against the UR deck felt pretty easy because we control their graveyard and they don’t play many threats. Don’t be greedy with your lantern and nuke their graveyard if they’re able to cast the crab.\n\n**Big Mana and Combo Decks: (0-2), depends on the deck.**\n\nSultai Reanimator: 0-1\n\nTemur Harmonizer: 0-1\n\nThoughts: \\*Crickets\\* I’m kinda happy that I don’t have to play against Reanimator anymore, and its absence is the opposite of my preseason expectations. The one match I played they had at least three Stormkeld Vanguard, which allowed them to deal with Torpor Orb and my other stuff. Good tech choice by them. \n\nHarmonizer is the kind of deck we are not constructed to beat, so we either need to ignore it or find a really good sideboard plan for it. Since I’m not seeing it much, I’m content to hope the tools I have are good enough.\n\n**Brews and Rogue Decks (3-4)**\n\nUW Auras: 1-0. A funny match where we blocked them forever and killed everything they put a Feather of Flight on, which they couldn’t stop because we had Voice of Victory in play. We won game three by milling them out.\n\nMardu Demonic Pact: 1-0. We deal with nonland permanents well.\n\nUB Annex: 1-0. Annex + Changeling Artifact, meet Requisition Raid.\n\nUW Merfolk: 0-1. Pressure + counterspells can be hard for us to beat.\n\nEsper Oculus: 0-1. Third game I hit a The End on Oculus. Had a Pursuit on board at 14 life. They had no cards in hand and a manifest token on the board. It was a Moonshadow. If it were any other card or I’d drawn a removal spell I think we would stabilize and win this one. I think we’re ok against this deck.\n\nBG Ugin: 0-1. Ugin decks are usually a big problem in game one and winnable after sideboarding. They’re usually pretty all in on Ugin and don’t do anything we can’t deal with after a The End on Ugin. I can’t remember how I lost this one. I think they were also playing Annex+Changeling artifact and I took too much damage from my own Pursuits before stabilizing.\n\nMono Green Haste: 0-1. This was a Cub/Ouro deck that played every green card with haste and trample plus combat tricks. Hard to block them, still a close 1-2 match.\n\n**Sideboarding**\n\nI’ll go over the plans for some popular matchups. In general, you want to try and leave your enchantment engine intact. \n\n**Ouro Cub:** \\-3 Soul Guide Lantern, -3 Requisition Raid. +2 The End, +2 Requitting Hex, +1 Caretaker’s Talent, +1 Dusk Rose Reliquary or Aang’s Iceberg.\n\nDepends on the colors they’re playing and what you expect. We’re on the sweepers with card advantage plan. You could consider leaving in some Soul Guide Lanterns and trim Builder’s Talent and/or Novice Inspector. It’s not the worst against Nature’s Rhythm. It might just be correct. Against white versions, you want some Requisition Raids.\n\nAgainst GB Variants that are playing graveyard recursion, Roots, etc. You want to cut Novice Inspector, trim engine pieces, and leave in your Lanterns and Requisition Raid (Roots only).\n\n**Icetill Cub:** \\-4 Novice Inspector, Trim some engine pieces. +2 The End, +1 Requisition Raid, +1 Caretaker’s Talent, +1 Soul Guide Lantern, +1 Aang’s Iceberg, +1 Dusk Rose Reliquary.\n\nSomething like this. The enchantments and the graveyard let them go long and trample over the 1/1s, so we want answers to them. They have a hard time recovering from a sweeper without Greenshell.\n\n**Jeskai Control:** \\-2 or 3 Day of Judgement, -1 or 2 Dusk Rose, -0 or 1 Tragic Trajectory, cut Raid and Lantern as needed. +1 Scavenger’s Talent, +3 Voice of Victory, +1 Caretaker’s Talent. Add The End and Iceberg as needed.\n\nSideboarding depends on what you see and expect. If you see a bunch of Seam Rip, max out on Requisition Raid. Lanterns are usually cut unless they’re playing Shiko. The End and Iceberg for planeswalkers. You need to leave in removal and some sweepers. \n\nI love playing this matchup and could write an entire guide on it I think. The beatdown/control role can change multiple times a game depending on what’s resolved. I think a lot of my success here comes from experience playing it while the control player will have little to none. \n\nA good Jeskai player will point every burn spell at your face. Your goal is to pressure them for most of the game and play around No More Lies as best you can, knowing that you’re capable of winning a long game. When your full enchantment engine is online with a Fountainport, you can switch to playing defense, and this is recommended. You don’t really need to cast anything into their counterspells at this point (which they have more of post-board), and you can gain life and block them until you mill them out with Scavenger’s Talent. Knowing when to cast Voice of Victory in the mid to lategame is an interesting, complicated subgame.\n\n**UB and UW Control:** \\-3 Requisition Raid, -4 Day of Judgement, Trim Removal/Lantern. +1 Scavenger’s Talent, +3 Voice of Victory, +1 Caretaker’s Talent, +1-2 The End, +0-1 Aang’s Iceberg, +2 Torpor Orb (Excruciator Only).  \n  \nI think we want to play Torpor Orb against Excruciator, even though we also have the Scavenger’s Talent angle. I think we want to cut Novice Inspector and Enduring Innocence when we bring it in, but cutting five cards that draw cards in a control matchup is a feelbad. Unlike Jeskai, I don’t think we want or need an insurance sweeper in these matchups, but I haven’t played enough to know about these choices for sure. The hardest thing for us to deal with in game one against control is an on-curve Elspeth, and we need to try and answer it in games 2 and 3. The End is good in both matchups. The End on Deceit leaves UB with no answers to a resolved Scavenger’s Talent.\n\n**UB Midrange:** \\-3 Requisition Raid, -3 Soul-Guide Lantern, Trim Novice, Builder’s, Pursuit. +3 Voice of Victory, +2 The End, +1 Dusk Rose Reliquary, +1 Caretakers, +1 Aang’s Iceberg. Consider two Hex over Trajectory, especially on the draw and against Bats. \n\nOur “presideboard” doesn’t really do much here, unless you consider killing Enduring Curiosity with Requisition Raid then exiling it with Soul Guide Lantern “doing something.” Yes, I have done this a few times. The more flyers/faeries they play, the less confident I am in consistently contending with this deck.  \n  \n**Elemental Midrange:** \\-3 Requisition Raid, -4 Novice Inspector, -1 Enduring Innocence. +2 Torpor Orb, +1 Caretaker’s, +2 The End, +1 Aang’s Iceberg, +1 Dusk Rose Reliquary, +1 Scavenger’s Talent.\n\nAs discussed above, Wistfulness is a nuisance. Once we get a Torpor Orb down we’re in good shape to go on the block forever and mill plan. We might need a third or even fourth copy if we see these decks a lot.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nA match winrate that rounds up to 60% would make me feel good about all this work, and we got there. Over two seasons and 55+ matches we’ve maintained a 57% winrate with this shell. If you took this deck to a tournament or league that was a lot of Cub, Lessons, and Jeskai Control and played well, you could Spike it for sure. Trying to win fair, grindy games in this format can be frustrating, but I think we do an ok job.\n\nWriting this out also helps me identify things I want to change. One thing I’m noticing is that I’m almost always boarding in Aang’s Iceberg and Caretaker’s Talent. Should we just be playing these cards? While I’m boarding out Requisition Raid a lot, I think the upside of having it in game 1 in matchups where I need it is worth it. We should be playing against more Lessons than I’ve seen, I think.  \n  \nI’d like to make the UB Midrange matchup a little better. I think it has to be something that deals with both Kaito and Enduring Curiosity. Maybe trading Dusk Rose Reliquary for Aang’s Iceberg is the right choice. It raises our curve and doesn’t have the sac synergy, but we gain some flexibility and power level, and we’re boarding it in for other matchups a lot of the time anyway.\n\nSince we’re always boarding in Caretaker’s, maybe it’s right to play one over a Builder’s Talent or Novice Inspector in the maindeck. I think I’m going to try that.\n\nThese changes would open up two sideboard slots for other things that give us trouble. Maybe some additional things for Combo Decks like Harmonizer and Kona (High Noon, Authority of the Consuls are coming to mind), or trying something like Ancient Vendetta (hate this kind of card) or Rise of Sozin. Maybe another Torpor Orb because Wistfulness exists. Bring back my pet card Astrelli Reclaimer or Ketramose, which is a nice sideboard card when Lantern is good? Back to the lab we go. I’d love to hear some suggestions.\n\n**Bonus Brews**\n\nThe other package in a similar shell that I want to try is Beseech the Mirror+Day of Judgement+Phoenix Fleet Airship. Beseech the Mirror is a very strong card with the right targets, and I think these are two good targets for it.\n\nI have three maindecks that I’ve been messing around with but haven’t pulled the trigger on building a sideboard and laddering with yet. Might commit to one of these next season for a change of pace.\n\n\n\n[**Mirror Control**](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/7625742#paper)\n\n\n\nSimilar thought process to our token brew, but we play Rest in Peace instead of Lantern. Like Lantern, I think Rest in Peace is a good card to maindeck in the right shell. Our core is a Carrot Cake/Caretaker’s talent card advantage deck that can tutor for a sweeper, finisher, or hate card as needed. \n\n\n\n[**Mirror Sac Combo Control - Forsaken Miner Version**](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/7626950#paper)\n\n[**Mirror Sac Combo Control - Token Generator Version**](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/7626958)\n\n\n\nThese builds are meant to abuse Umbral Collar Zealot with either Scavenger’s Talent or Obsessive Pursuit. We do some cute stuff with Forsaken Miner in the first one. Level 2 of Scavenger Talent lets us commit crimes, which lets us recur Forsaken Miner as many times as our black mana allows. We can use this to do a combination of: milling our opponent out, draw cards off Curiosity, make a huge creature off of Obsessive Pursuit, or crew all our Airships. A Pitiless Plunderer effect would make this one legit I think.  \n  \nThe other one plays off the idea of having 12 one drops to curve into Pursuit for more early pressure, and getting value off of them later in the game.\n\n  \nHave fun!  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n",

    "text": "TLDR: partner has taken on massive debt due to frivolous spending and hid it from me. How do I ever emotionally recover from this and trust her again?  \n\nBeen together for 20 years and married for ten. A year back I found out that she has taken on a bunch of debt due to unnecessary spending. Somewhere near 100k. This includes credit cards and loans. She’s been asking her parents for money to help pay back the high interest loans and ccs. Most of the money has been spent online shopping and on personal splurging (beauty, clothing, entertainment etc). I had no idea this was happening until I caught her in a blatant lie and she confessed to it all. I’m still sick to my stomach.  \n\nWe agreed to do relationship counselling which was more or less a bust. The therapist acknowledged it was financial infidelity but seemed to think I should have no issues trusting her again. My wife promised that was the end of it and her defence was that it was mostly “family expenses”. Since then we’ve had another major blowout a few months ago when I found out the spending hasn’t really stopped. Even worse, it seems to be coupled with constant lying and deceit. Things like taking time off work for an “important doctors appointment” only for me to find a receipt for thousands of dollars at a medspa from that same day….  \n\nWhat are my next steps and how can I ever trust her again? I can’t even begin to process leaving this relationship. It’s all I’ve known and we have a family together. I’m considering simply protecting my finances and my retirement by cancelling all of our joint accounts and maybe we can do like roommates do and split every household expense 50/50.  I can’t control the spending but I atleast need to protect my own future. \n\nMoney is one thing but I want to be able to trust her again. I’ve caught her lying to my face so many times that I don’t know how to ever regain that. It feels like such a deep betrayal and it hurts so bad. If I want to make this work what do I need to do! What kind of action plan can I create with firm boundaries? It’s really bothering me that the therapist downplayed the severity of this. ",

QQQ has performed worse where previous level of support could very well turn resistance.\n\nCombine this with the lofty narratives and story telling about AI and the outrageous amount of infrastructure being built for it, this suspiciously sounds like speculation.\n\nI'm short these three stocks (LEAPS puts): TSLA, NVDA, PLTR. Currently, my positions are up around 5%, 8%, 8% respectively.\n\n1. TSLA\n\n[TSLA - Weekly](https://preview.redd.it/8ik55gdfyxhg1.png?width=2948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=906bdc89036bde2c2d14c1c0ce04102d6834b870)\n\nThe price is hovering at the VWAP since late July of 2025. The average loser since then is losing money on the stock.\n\n[TSLA - 10 min](https://preview.redd.it/j9oseakxyxhg1.jpg?width=4316&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ecc2c2894b2a0753ac397b7f5f946bbd966a7c2c)\n\nOn a shorter time frame, the previous band of support is seemingly acting as resistance. The 5 day MA is trending down. Given the high valuation of the stock, this won't be a bad place for new entries as well as to hold your short. Additionally, Elon has been just moving from one business to another when competitors catch up and now planning a merger with his other ventures. This IMO is a red flag. If the 5 day moving average stabilizes and starts pointing upwards, and it breaks through this resistance, I'll close my position and humbly accept I was wrong.\n\n2. NVDA\n\n[NVDA - 10 mins](https://preview.redd.it/bnso12apzxhg1.jpg?width=4452&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc5adb239d6b1ed97f6b28a44cd29b8eaecd428c)\n\nNVDA also started reversing towards the end of the day after, admittedly, having a really strong run from its down days. Even though it's above the 5 day MA, the MA is still pointing down and perhaps NVDA could consolidate and run higher from here. I will close my position if that happens. If you ignore today's run, the average investor since May 2025 would've been losing money. This is for the most hyped stock on the street. Despite the hype, the stock is hovering at levels since August of last year. This also looks like distribution. Combine this with the circular deals and increasing depreciation years look like cooking the books to me. Hence, I'm short.\n\n3. PLTR\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lspdiq1w0yhg1.png?width=4456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dfb183c870ae77a62c4cbe2c61b7812ae99261c\n\nI'm most bearish on this one. Everyone knows about the ridiculous valuation it has in relation to its earnings. There's an endless AI/modern warfare narration around this stock and it seems priced for perfection and rarely ever do things go perfectly. People call this a growth stock as if growth is a free pass to be completely disconnected from financials. As you can see from the chart, I have a short position since Jan 13 when the price was around $180.\n\nNotice the VWAP from early August lows. The average investor since that low is losing money. Let alone the people who bought this stock above $180. I feel more pain is in store for this stock and I can see this one sliding close to $100.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pjq4doim1yhg1.png?width=4440&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37cf0e074b7367a2c288cb761c2f97e86f2a7a94\n\nThe VWAP since earnings aligns perfectly with the 5 day MA and despite a green day today and blowout earnings, this seems to be trending down in the short term as well. In fact, I'd mentioned on another thread or forum that the earnings pop seemed like a bull trap, and indeed it did trap quite a few. Excited and impatient speculators or bag holders  must have been very happy with the price action today and I'm sure many loaded up with the lint of their pockets on this one by averaging down. If my assessment is correct, this just mean greater pain for them. This stock has lately gotten a reality check and hopefully it continues to do so. My exit plan is if it rises above the VWAP from earnings, 5 day MA flattens or starts rising and it stabilizes in that region around 140-145.\n\nMore power to you all!  \nPS: I hold long positions on TSLA and NVDA both and I'm up significantly up on those. These are just hedges for additional money against all the speculation and downturns.\n\nOf course, this is not financial advice!",

    "text": "I had a friend who worked at an internet service provider and I asked him to register a domain name for me in August of 1995. \n\nHe didn't tell me but he registered it in his company's name instead of mine.\n\n It's a valuable one word .com site that I ran for decades and during covid we got to an argument and he just took it down and now it leads to a dead link but I can see clearly that it's registered with the company he worked for.\n \nIf I can prove I ran it. I have magazine articles from the 90s and 2000s with my name and face &amp; the domain name. And also the wayback machine &amp; internet archive.\n\nIs there anyway to get it back? Show he acted in bad faith by registering under his company instead of my name as I asked when all the work and content was done by me?\nHow would I go about this? I have tried talking to him but he is hostile about it. Is there some process I can do?\n \nOr am I screwed? \n \nEDIT Update: I didn't know much about it at the time, he ran a hosting company and I put up the site it was one of if not the first audio streaming sites. First with prank calls, then internet radio shows (before they were called podcasts) first using real audio, then real player, &amp; shoutcast radio,. using 14,400 baud then 26,8 then 56k which then allowed videos, forums, the whole nine yards.\n\nThe site became extremely popular especially from the late nineties to mid 2000s as more people got broadband  \nand before the giants like MySpace the Facebook YouTube took over. \n \nOur agreement was that he would cover costs as long as I advertised &amp; promoted his hosting company on the site &amp; in the streaming shows, which I did. No I didn't get anything in writing. I was young &amp; dumb and just having a fun time running the site, making the pranks &amp; sketches &amp; then the live radio show. No other site was doing this at the time. I was covered in 1998 .NET magazine, Harley Hahns internet yellow pages, New Times magazine did an 8 page feature. \n\nI chose the name (it's  one word &amp; my handle I was know as) I designed the site &amp; created all the content. We were good friends so I didn't think much about it until the late 2000s as it started to die down as independent websites lost out to the biggies. I asked about the domain several times as I wanted to move it to my own server but he always dodged the question or made excuses or said don't worry about it I'll still host it for you.. no worries yada yada. I knew shit was going to go bad but what was I going to do? The site became more of a nostalgia thing &amp; and archive of my older stuff and then I started moving to &amp; integrating the bigger sites like vimeo &amp; youtube &amp; a few different live streaming tech in around 2009. We stayed friends though distant.\n\nThere's a lot more to it but I don't want to write a novel. \nIf you were on the internet in the late 90s early to mid 2000s &amp; you like prank calls then you should already know the site. No not Jerry Boys or phone loosers of America just one word which was my handle &amp; the site url. \n \nYes, I was dumb dumb dumb. I thought you bought the name and you owned it, I didn't know about the $50 or so recurring fees at the time. I was all into the content creation. As time went on and I did learn these things &amp; talk to him trying to get everything over to my servers and my name he would always make some excuse or avoid or dodge ect ect. Till our big blowout fight &amp; then he did what I was worried about &amp; took it offline and then hid the ownership. \n \nI consulted a few people &amp; some preliminary free law stuff and Ai and found that since that was the name I went by and all the branding was on my content and my pranks and my show that even though he registered the domain in his company, he did so in bad faith as I asked him to do it for me and did initially pay whatever a domain name cost in 1995... it was virtually nothing. \n\nThe wayback machine shows the site from about 1998 and there are Blank &amp; blank.com copyright 1995-20xx on many pages.\n\nSome people DMed me to file a UDRP claim with icann. They seem to be more about who what is actually USING and creating the site than who registered it, especially if it was a brand. No I had no trademarks but I sold CDs, tee-shirts gadgets yada yada.\n\nI hope that gives you more context.",

    "text": "# What is this?\n\nAll season long, I have been scraping every single comment posted on r/CFB. Yes, even yours! I started doing this a while ago to practice doing database stuff, and also to satisfy my curiosity on questions like “how many fans of each team are there on r/CFB?” or “What CFB fanbase says ‘fuck’ the most?”.\n\nI ended up with 5,148,617 total comments from 15,874 posts, starting from 12PM midnight on 8/1/2025 and ending at midnight on 1/21/2026. It includes every link and discussion, every game thread and post game thread, and the many many posts that are basically just some guy’s tweet. If you’re curious, I scraped the data using the [Python Reddit API wrapper PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), I stored the data in a Postgres database, and I did most of the actual data analysis with R.\n\nThen, I had a really original and fun idea to kind of “wrap up” all the activity that this data documents, which leads me to this post! You’ll want to pay really close attention and focus on it completely as you read, because it’s really neat, so I’ve decided to call it **“The** r/CFB **Rapt.”** So with no further preamble, here is the 2025-26 r/CFB Rapt! I hope you have fun reading, and if you have any questions you want answered with the data, just let me know!\n\n# A Year in Review\n\n# Top [Game Thread]s of 2025-26\n\n**Biggest Game Threads:**\n\nTo begin with, here are the top 10 biggest \\[Game Thread\\]s of the season, ranked by the total number of comments.

Also worth noting that Indiana appears in in 3 out of the top 5! They must have had a pretty good season I guess?\n\n**Most Foul-Mouthed Game Threads:**\n\nWe can also sort this list in a few other fun ways – for example, here are the top 10 game threads of the year, ranked by how often people were swearing in them. My swear detection is pretty comprehensive, and also includes acronyms like “wtf” or “lmao”, plus irregular spellings like “fuuuuuuuuck” or “dayum!”\n\n*Note: In order to avoid the issue of small denominators throwing things off, I only looked at game threads with a minimum of at least 7,500 total comments for these.*\n\n|Title|Date|N Comments Total|N Distinct Users|N Comments per User|Swears per 100 Words|P Downvoted|P Ref Complaints|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\[Game Thread\\] Georgia vs. Ole Miss (8:00 PM ET)|01/01/2026|52,001|9,043|5.69|1.75|4.50%|8.70%|\n|\\[Game Thread\\] Louisville @ Miami (7:00 PM ET)|10/17/2025|16,621|3,289|4.99|1.58|3.09%|5.19%|\n|\\[Game Thread\\] Texas A&amp;M @ Notre Dame (7:30 PM ET)|09/13/2025|15,885|2,719|5.79|1.55|4.20%|2.10%|\n|\\[Game Thread\\] Vanderbilt @ Texas (12:00 PM ET)|11/01/2025|10,665|1,980|5.32|1.54|6.23%|7.12%|\n|\\[Game Thread\\] Florida State @ Virginia (7:00 PM ET)|09/26/2025|23,591|3,965|5.92|1.52|4.08%|2.58%|\n|\\[Game Thread\\] Georgia @ Auburn (7:30 PM ET)|10/11/2025|24,473|3,491|6.92|1.51|8.74%|13.08%|\n|\\[Game Thread\\] Alabama @ Georgia (7:30 PM ET)|09/27/2025|16,448|2,740|5.97|1.49|4.87%|2.17%|\n|\\[Game Thread\\] USC @ Notre Dame (7:30 PM ET)|10/18/2025|8,978|1,247|7.09|1.49|6.91%|6.27%|\n|\\[Game Thread\\] Alabama @ Auburn (7:30 PM ET)|11/29/2025|23,715|3,905|6.02|1.48|5.64%|7.06%|\n|\\[Game Thread\\] Tennessee @ Alabama (7:30 PM ET)|10/18/2025|11,306|1,659|6.77|1.46|7.65%|3.17%|\n\n&gt;Georgia and Ole Miss combined to create a game thread with over 50,000 comments where almost 2% of all words typed were a profanity of some kind.

the most, swear the most, and more.\n\n* **For all of these, I’m excluding teams with fewer than 10,000 total comments to avoid issues with small denominators.** Again though, I can pull these stats for any school, so please let me know if you’d like that info for your team!\n\n# Overall Activity\n\nFirst, let’s see which fanbases are the most active and engaged this season. I’m doing this by simply dividing the total number of comments by the total number of unique users.\n\n|Rank|School|N Comments per User|N Users|N Comments|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\#1|Texas Tech|95.67|944|90,309|\n|\\#2|Ole Miss|88.16|716|63,121|\n|\\#3|BYU|77.31|779|60,226|\n|\\#4|Utah|76.33|795|60,686|\n|\\#5|Northwestern|74.56|231|17,224|\n|\\#6|Boise State|74.35|395|29,367|\n|\\#7|Georgia|73.22|3,338|244,418|\n|\\#8|Indiana|69.93|1,652|115,529|\n|\\#9|Oklahoma|68.63|2,203|151,184|\n|\\#10|Oregon|68.31|2,251|153,758|\n\n&gt;Despite stumbling a bit down the stretch, Texas Tech’s playoff season was exciting enough to get their fans more engaged (at least on here) than those of any other school! The other teams at the top are no surprise either – they’re almost all teams that historically aren’t elite at football, but put up some elite seasons this year. Also Northwestern is there? Honestly I have no idea on that one.\n\n# Comment Scores / % Downvoted\n\nI also analyzed the comments’ scores to see which fanbases tend to get upvoted / downvoted the most, to get an idea of how this sub feels about each fanbase. To find the most beloved fanbase, I simply found the team with the highest average score:\n\n|Rank|School|Avg Score|N Users|N Comments|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\#1|Purdue|17.43|664|19,851|\n|\\#2|Baylor|15.41|398|20,270|\n|\\#3|Wisconsin|12.98|1,083|32,152|\n|\\#4|Florida|12.72|2,097|97,923|\n|\\#5|West Virginia|12.64|636|23,824|\n|\\#6|James Madison|12.35|309|15,048|\n|\\#7|UCLA|12.30|557|21,595|\n|\\#8|Georgia Tech|12.17|1,214|69,181|\n|\\#9|Penn State|12.14|2,243|95,712|\n|\\#10|Washington|12.11|1,268|54,260|\n\n&gt;I would never have guessed it, but congrats to Purdue fans for having the highest quality comments, apparently! This list was very surprising to me and I wasn’t able to make much sense of it. Florida? WVU? Penn State? I guess maybe out of pity?\n\nInstead of just finding the lowest average score, I did something slightly different and found the % of each school’s comments that ended up downvoted (i.e. a score of 0 or below). I think this gives us a much better list of r/CFB’s most hated fanbases this year:\n\n|Rank|School|P Downvoted|N Users|N Comments|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\#1|LSU|10.04%|1,606|78,548|\n|\\#2|No Flair|9.48%|62,134|599,459|\n|\\#3|Alabama|9.12%|3,073|179,993|\n|\\#4|Notre Dame|8.76%|2,510|165,941|\n|\\#5|Colorado|8.60%|506|17,364|\n|\\#6|Texas|8.43%|3,247|164,676|\n|\\#7|Michigan|8.39%|4,617|236,241|\n|\\#8|USC|8.17%|1,151|63,948|\n|\\#9|Vanderbilt|8.10%|381|22,513|\n|\\#10|Miami|7.65%|1,206|69,463|\n\n&gt;Wow people really hated LSU this year! They were even more often downvoted than the *unflaired*, which is a really difficult feat historically. There are the usual suspects like Bama and Texas. You also can see Notre Dame and Michigan dealing with their various uhhhh PR fumbles this year. Not sure why Colorado (surely the Deion effect has worn off by now?) or Vandy are on here though.\n\n# Swearing\n\nI can also calculate how foul-mouthed each fanbase is by finding the number of swear words for every 100 words in their comments. Here are the top 10 most profane and polite fanbases so far this year, starting with the highest swear rates:\n\n|Rank|School|Swears per 100 Words|N Users|N Comments|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\#1|Houston|0.94|342|20,329|\n|\\#2|Georgia|0.84|3,338|244,418|\n|\\#3|Arizona State|0.84|799|50,053|\n|\\#4|Miami|0.82|1,206|69,463|\n|\\#5|Kansas|0.81|559|22,417|\n|\\#6|South Carolina|0.81|1,143|57,378|\n|\\#7|Utah|0.79|795|60,686|\n|\\#8|Boise State|0.79|395|29,367|\n|\\#9|Tennessee|0.78|2,061|99,542|\n|\\#10|Auburn|0.78|1,387|66,383|\n\n&gt;I’m not sure what y’all were so angry about honestly, but congrats to Houston for taking a commanding victory in this category, with swears making up nearly 1% of all words typed. I’m very proud to see Kansas on here, and I totally get why considering how things went this year. GOD I fucking hate Missouri.\n\nNow for the fanbases that swear the least:\n\n|Rank|School|Swears per 100 Words|N Users|N Comments|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\#1|BYU|0.44|779|60,226|\n|\\#2|Rutgers|0.49|413|16,526|\n|\\#3|SMU|0.50|203|12,318|\n|\\#4|Penn State|0.51|2,243|95,712|\n|\\#5|Notre Dame|0.52|2,510|165,941|\n|\\#6|Virginia Tech|0.52|1,011|52,214|\n|\\#7|California|0.53|597|31,837|\n|\\#8|Virginia|0.54|487|24,309|\n|\\#9|Syracuse|0.55|319|13,157|\n|\\#10|James Madison|0.55|309|15,048|\n\n&gt;BYU was scarily close to losing their crown in this category, with Tulane actually clocking in with a lower swear rate (0.396 swears per 100 words) but falling just short of the 10,000 comment cutoff. BYU’s much larger total sample size makes their number more impressive if you ask me, but the nerds of Tulane deserve a shoutout for their exceptionally polite comments as well.\n\n# Complaining about the Refs\n\nI also searched the comments for words and phrases that usually indicate a complaint about the refs. This isn’t perfect, because it misses vaguely worded things like “man fuck this shit”, and can include some false positives like “the refs are doing a great job and I love them!”, but it’s close enough to do the job.

I’m tired of the same old lines of training staff twisting ankles or pace of play being the cause for our injuries. This is just the schizophrenic reasoning I needed during this dogshit season. \n\nI welcome any real scientists, electricians, and armchair doctors to “um, actually” this theory in the comments, but  it still won’t stop me from propagating this conspiracy everytime we get a bad Grizz PR injury report.

Some have been around for decades and others have sprung up in the past 5-8 years when card collecting became what it is now. \n\nAs a kid (1990s), I remember shops always having decent hobby stock of the latest releases, tons of packs. Nowadays, every time I go in to one of the shops around my area, they only have the same retail blaster crap as Target and Wal-Mart for the most part. There's maybe a handful of Megas, and 1-2 hobby boxes of a few sports (not even the current release year, usually), and that's it.  \n\nIt's been sad to see the transition - one of the newer ones is basically converted into a breaker's studio now and almost never restocks, and the decades-old one is more a vintage jersey store now and probably would have gone out of business a long time ago if I wasn't fairly sure they owned the building. \n\nSo what's happening? AreTopps/Panini/Upper Deck basically giving all of their hobby stock to the online behemoths (Dave &amp; Adam's, Steel City, Blowout) and select breakers? Have they priced out LCS' from hobby inventory? It sucks not being able to go into a LCS and grab a hobby box (or even just hobby-level packs) same day anymore.\n\n",

    "text": "One of the most popular complaints I see in the Hobby involves folks saying some form of “breakers get all the products”. Then, a hobby simp or Fanatics burner account will always chime in with “Fanatics has a public presale where you can always buy boxes at MSRP!”\n\nIs that \\*technically\\* true? Yes.\n\nHowever, my main question is what’s the actual allotment put aside for the public?\n\nMy theory is that Fanatics releases an EXTREMELY small number of boxes for the general public. I’m talking less than 5% of the total available inventory. It’s the one and only way you can explain how EVERY SINGLE RELEASE “sells out” within 90 seconds.\n\nFanatics wants you to believe it’s because millions and millions of people are flooding Topps.com or Fanatics.com and buying tens of thousands of cases.\n\nI think it’s because they release an extremely small amount of actual cases in a public release. That way they can pretend “everyone” has a fair shot at regular pricing, before the aftermarket monster takes hold and suddenly you’re paying 50% to 125% more for the same box.\n\nThen, after they offer all their preferred breakers a case or two at MSRP… they come back a week later and say “you’re entitled to another two cases, but now they are \\*market price\\*. Which means even breakers are now paying a 50% to 125% markup, which much like tariffs, those costs are passed on to who? You nailed it. The consumer.\n\n2025 Topps Cosmic Chrome is a perfect example. Fanatics had a “presale” at $335 a box I believe. Now? They are $625-$700 on all resale sites.\n\nI don’t even care that Fanatics is shady as fuck with their pricing. They’re a business. They can do whatever they want. What I wish happened, was that much like the lottery or casinos… they had to be 100% transparent about everything.\n\nThat way if they are only offering ten cases to the public, and then 10,000 cases to breakers… at least we know. And at that point can make a much better decision on what, if anything, we want to buy.\n\nAnd make no mistake… Fanatics is very much trying to eliminate the local card shop. Both of the ones I go to are both considering closing up shop, because their allotments are next to nothing, and then the only way they can even get more is via Fanatics at “market price”, or through BlowOut of Dave and Adam’s, who are more or less directly aligned with Fanatics.\n\nWhen your LCS can’t get product from the producer, it’s only a matter of time before the numbers no longer work to be profitable and stay open.\n\nAt that point, Fanatics will have completely destroyed the physical market, and if you want to stay in the Hobby, you have to deal with them directly (if you’re extremely lucky at presale), or what they REALLY want… is for you to have no choice but to buy directly from their Fanatics Live breakers.\n\nI hope I’m wrong.",

Now that he's led the Bears to an NFC North title and their first playoff win in 15 years with a 3,900-yard/27-TD regular season, the ceiling feels much higher-especially for a PSA 10 1/1 card.\n\nGiven the performance surge and the 10 grade, I'm feeling the true value is now well north of that $53k benchmark.

    "text": "After going deeper on Chrome NBA to see whether haywire sealed pricing and rare hit distribution actually had some correlation, a few people asked if the same approach could be applied to Chrome Update. I thought that was a fair question.\n\n  \nUnlike Chrome NBA, Chrome Update does not have the cheat-code Hanger format. It also lacks a single format that has caught fire the way Breaker’s Delight did on the NBA side. That makes this exercise useful in a different way. It helps answer whether the big hits are concentrated in hobby formats, whether Value Boxes and Megas are truly as barren as they feel, or whether there is any sneaky value play that avoids paying up for hobby.\n\n  \n**The questions this research tries to answer:**\n\nWhich formats offer the best rare hit potential across hobby and retail?\n\nHow many boxes of each format does it take to pull a rare hit?\n\nAre Breaker’s Delight boxes actually as loaded as they appear?\n\nIs there any realistic value in $40 Value Boxes or $70 Megas?\n\n\n\n\n\n**What qualifies as a “rare hit” here?**\n\n  \n1) **Parallels, autos, or inserts numbered /50 or less, including:**  \nGold, White, Orange, Black and Red base parallels, autos, and insert parallels, FrozenFractors, Superfractors, Printing Plates, Cupfractors Gold or better, Image Variations Gold or better, Radiating Rookie Autos, Dual and Triple Autos, Legend Autos, Cupfractor Autos, ASG Image Variations Gold or better, and Larry David Autos.\n\n2) **Case hit or tougher inserts, including:**  \nRadiating Rookies, Chrome Home Field Advantage, Helix, Major League Minis, Alter Egos, Exposé, Celebración, Mickey and Friends, and MLB Debut Patches.\n\n  \nOne important reminder: I can identify frequencies, not name distribution. Odds do not tell us which players land in which formats. We have to assume reasonably even distribution. If 90% of Nick Kurtz Gold autos are seeded into one format, the only way to know is by watching rips.\n\n  \n**Enhanced Hit Frequencies**\n\n  \nHow many **Hobby** Boxes to pull:  \n≤50 parallel: 2.3 boxes  \nCase hit insert: 12 boxes  \n≤50 OR case hit: 1.93 boxes (6.22 rare hits per case)  \n1.93 boxes × $300 (Blowout) = **$579 per rare hit**\n\n  \nHow many **Jumbo** Boxes to pull:  \n≤50 parallel: 1.38 boxes  \nCase hit insert: 7.89 boxes  \n≤50 OR case hit: 1.18 boxes (6.78 rare hits per case)  \n1.18 boxes × $550 (Blowout) = **$649 per rare hit**\n\n  \nHow many **Breaker’s Delight** boxes to pull:  \n≤50 parallel: 1.04 boxes  \nCase hit insert: 6.09 boxes  \n≤50 OR case hit: 0.89 boxes (6.74 rare hits per case)  \n0.89 boxes × $600 (Blowout) = **$534 per rare hit** (math says this is best, wallet says \"Don't you dare\")\n\n  \nHow many **Value** Boxes to pull:  \n≤50 parallel: 35.75 boxes  \nCase hit insert: 353.65 boxes  \n≤50 OR case hit: 32.47 boxes (1.23 rare hits per case)  \n32.47 boxes × $40 MSRP = **$1,298.80 per rare hit**\n\n  \nHow many **Mega** Boxes to pull:  \n≤50 parallel: 16.99 boxes  \nCase hit insert: 76.17 boxes  \n≤50 OR case hit: 13.89 boxes (1.44 rare hits per case)  \n13.89 boxes × $70 MSRP = **$972.30 per rare hit**\n\n  \n\n\n**Takeaways**\n\n  \n1) **2025 Chrome Update is much tamer than 2024 Chrome Update**. The checklist is far weaker, but in addition Chrome NBA simply stole its thunder. Going deeper here highlights just how extreme Chrome NBA’s numbers are on both ends of the spectrum. Chrome NBA is essentially Chrome Update on steroids.\n\n  \n**Let me make some brief numerical comparisons between Chrome Update &amp; Chrome NBA:**\n\n**Best rare hit rate**:\n\n**Chrome Update**\n\nBreaker’s Delight: 0.89 boxes / $534\n\nHobby: 1.93 boxes / $579\n\n  \n**Chrome NBA**\n\nHangers: 8.94 boxes / $178.80\n\nFanatics Megas: 3.76 boxes / $376\n\n  \nIt's hard to get behind $500+ to pull a rare hit, most of which will be of unwanted players and will have nowhere near the value of a similar hit in NBA. \n\n  \n\n\n2) **There is very little reason to buy retail for Chrome Update**. Value Boxes and Megas are exactly what we thought they were: a barren wasteland. Among hobby formats, all three are fairly similar. The checklist simply lacks enough top-end names to make any format compelling from a value standpoint.\n\n  \nEven with MLB Debut Patches being among the biggest hits of the year, I do not see sealed prices moving higher from here. They may even...(GASP!)...go down further. I would not be surprised if this product sits on shelves for a while.\n\n  \n**The worst thing that happened to 2025 Chrome Update was 2025 Chrome NBA**. Topps showed they can build a massive, high-impact product with exponentially more huge hits, a stacked checklist, and a generational rookie, without relying on 270 Debut Patches to juice it up. Sure, NBA has Gold Logomen...but there are 15 in total and the 3 players featured aren't even some of the most sought after (okay, one is). \n\n  \nI'm typically a baseball guy through and through. But this is my objective take: \n\n**In the new era of juiced up production, Topps has proven they can still create a masterful product. But 2025 Chrome Update is just not it.**\n\n  \nBut hey. At least it gave us Alter Egos.",

    "text": "I often point out that the “Hit Frequency by Format” numbers I post (parallels per box, cards per box, etc.) are cumulative averages across all boxes within a format.\n\n  \nThe more I’ve watched this product get ripped, the more it feels like certain formats, especially Breaker’s Delight, are disproportionately landing bigger hits. We’ve seen some truly absurd cases (looking at you u/blezsportscards).\n\n  \nThat got me wondering whether the numbers themselves could help validate or challenge that perception across both hobby and retail SKUs.\n\n  \n**How I approached this:**\n\n  \nInstead of focusing on per-box averages, I asked a different question:  \n How many boxes of each format does it take to pull a “rare hit”?\n\nI looked at two buckets:\n\n  \n1) **Low-numbered parallels (≤50 copies)**  \nThis includes Gold, Orange, Black, Red, Super, and Frozenfractor parallels, along with those same parallels of Basketballs, Pulsars, Raywaves, and Geometrics. I also included Image Variation and Auto parallels numbered /50 or less.\n\n  \nI understand there are meaningful hits numbered higher than 50 (ex: Flagg Blue Auto /150, Flagg Green Image Variation /99), but those apply to only a handful of players and don’t materially change format-level dynamics.\n\n  \n2) **Case Hit or tougher inserts**  \nThese include Rock Stars, Let’s Go!, Ultra Violet, Radiating Rookies, Helix, Lightboard Logos, Hidden Gems, Advisory, Glass Canvas, Paradox, Patented, Fanatical, Finals, and Gold Logomen.\n\n  \nUsing published odds, I can calculate the frequencies of low-numbered parallels and Case Hits without much trouble. What I cannot account for is name distribution. Odds don’t tell us which players land in which formats. If 90% of Gold Cooper Flagg autos are seeded into Jumbos, I can't help you there. The only way to know that is by watching rips.\n\n  \n**Quick side note:**  \nSome base Geometric insert and auto parallels are insanely rare. If the published odds are accurate (which I assume is the case because they are consistent), base Geometric parallels of common inserts are limited to roughly 2–3 copies each. Very few people will actually realize this, so their relative value will almost certainly be amiss.\n\nBase Geometric autos are similarly scarce. They’re limited to about 20–25 copies each and are far tougher to pull than their Purple or Gold counterparts.\n\n  \n**What this exercise is actually trying to answer:**\n\n  \n1) Relative pricing, not secondary wax insanity.  \nNot “are current wax prices justified?,” but rather:  \nIs Breaker’s priced at 3× Hobby because you’re \\~3× more likely to land a rare hit?  \n2) What about retail? Are Hangers truly “bangers\" when it comes to rare hits as well? Or does it just feel that way due to volume?\n\n3) Which formats offer the best rare hit potential, including hobby and retail?  \n4) Are Breaker’s Delight boxes really as loaded as they seem?  \n5) Is there any realistic value to be squeezed from $50 blasters or $85 megas? Spoiler: maybe. But your wallet may disagree. \n\n  \n**Enhanced Hit Frequencies**\n\nSee my original breakdown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseballcards/comments/1nzvw3y/202526_topps_basketball_breakdown_and_deep_dive/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button) to see a complete list of hit frequencies by format.\n\n  \n**How many Hobby boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 3.85 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 9.78 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 2.76 boxes (4.35/case)  \n2.76 boxes × $625/box (Blowout) = $1,725 per rare hit\n\n  \n**How many Jumbo boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 1.93 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 5.74 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 1.45 boxes (5.52/case)  \n1.45 boxes × $1,815 (D&amp;A) = $2,631.75 per rare hit\n\n  \n**How many Breaker’s Delight boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 0.74 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 10.7 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 0.69 boxes (8.7/case)  \n0.69 boxes × $2,500 (D&amp;A) = $1,725 per rare hit  \n0.69 boxes × $2,150 (eBay) = $1,483.50 per rare hit\n\n  \n**How many Value boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 26.31 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 13.27 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 8.82 boxes (4.54/case)  \n8.82 boxes × $50 = $441 per rare hit\n\n  \n**How many Hanger boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 15.53 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 21.05 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 8.94 boxes (7.16/case)  \n8.94 boxes × $20 = $178.80 per rare hit\n\n  \n**How many Mega boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 14.92 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 6.62 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 4.59 boxes  \n4.59 boxes × $85 = $390.15 per rare hit\n\n  \n**How many Fanatics Mega boxes to pull:**  \n≤50 Parallel: 15.42 boxes  \n≥Case Hit Insert: 4.97 boxes  \n≤50 Parallel OR Insert ≥Case Hit: 3.76 boxes (4.36/case)  \n3.76 boxes × $100 = $376 per rare hit\n\n  \n**Takeaways**\n\n  \n1) **Breaker’s Delight really is different.**  \nA \"Rare Hit\" can be expected in slightly more than 2 out of 3 Breaker's boxes. Assuming names are somewhat evenly dispersed, it’s about 4× more likely to pull a big hit from Breaker’s Delight than from Hobby, and more than 2× more likely than from Jumbo. Based on Big Hit potential alone, Jumbo should cost about twice as much as hobby, and Breaker's should cost about 4× Hobby (meaning Breaker's should also cost twice as much as Jumbo).\n\nIn short- avoid Jumbo boxes. \n\n  \nIt's easy to see why Breaker’s has surpassed Jumbo in price by a decent margin. When Breaker’s was under $2,000, it was unquestionably the best hobby SKU for landing big hits. It took pricing reaching $2,500 at DA Card World to roughly equal Hobby in “$ per rare hit.”\n\nThere are still boxes on eBay around $2,150 if you feel compelled to go that route, which sounds absolutely ludicrous. But I am not here to judge financial decisions. I am merely here to spreadsheet them. Also consider a base Flagg auto is holding near $2,000, and it's not uncommon to see multiple big hits from a single Breaker’s box.\n\n  \n2) **Retail is hiding more value than most people realize.**  \nEvery retail format beats every hobby format in $ per rare hit- and it's not even close. **You absolutely do not need to pay hobby prices to hit big cards in this product.**\n\nHangers continue to prove they’re bangers, boasting the best ratio of all formats at $179 per rare hit. While not scarce (500k+ produced), there are still 20% more Megas than Hangers, and over twice as many Value boxes. It's just as easy to pull a rare hit from a Hanger as it is from a Value box, which is significant considering they are $20 vs $50 for Values. \n\n**The wildest stat in this entire breakdown: an average case of Hangers delivers just one fewer rare hit than an average case of Breaker’s Delight... at only 6.4% of the cost.**\n\nHangers are still available direct from Fanatics and Topps. Once they’re gone, there’s precisely zero chance they remain at $20. At current pricing, they are the cheapest path to hitting everything that isn’t hobby exclusive. Full transparency.... I'm hoarding them. \n\n  \n3) **Fanatics Megas excel at Case Hits.**  \nIf nothing else, Fanatics Megas provide the most efficient route to Case Hit or tougher inserts, landing at roughly 1 in every 5 boxes.\n\n  \n4) I received some pushback on my original write-up for calling this a masterfully crafted product, but I still stand by that assessment. How else does a Chrome release with roughly 90 million cards manage to feel this consistently loaded? It’s the largest Chrome product ever produced, yet it also commands the highest per-box pricing we've ever seen from a Chrome release. u/Topps got a lot of things right with this release, regardless of how homerish I may sound.

    "text": "I’m sure this is a question as old as time, but forgive my ignorance. As a collector who has been in the hobby for a year, I have learned quite a bit, but I still have much more learning to do. I’m sure the question above will help others like me who are slowly getting into the hobby.\n\nI have a local card shop in my area that has very reasonable prices for the sports that I collect, which is football (soccer), European basketball, and baseball. They do an amazing job of getting any hobby box that I request if they are able. This year I have been able to pick up topps finest, multiple topps chrome products, and really any baseball product I would like. I typically prefer to buy hobby boxes over blasters/retail and I am slowly getting into buying singles on EBay and at local card shows. I really enjoy being a wax ripping degenerate and I even protect a lot of my base cards even though I know boxes are -EV long term. \n\nThere is one thing I have noticed, sometimes my LCS prices hobby boxes higher than what I can find online from retailers like Dave and Adam’s and Blowout Cards. For example, I want a box of 2024-25 Topps Chrome UEFA Club Competitions Soccer Hobby Box. My LCS is selling it for $225. Wax Stat has the average box price $239.95, and then there is another site that I saw a box for $200. Let me say this, I know that shops are really able to price their products however the hell they want and they probably get products at MSRP. My LCS is not budging on his price with me and I fear his 15 boxes will sit on the shelf for a long time. \n\nAs a consumer, I’m a little bit of a penny pincher and I want to make sure I’m not overpaying for the same product. Is there any tips that long term collector can give me that will save me money long term? \n\nSide note, one thing that I have an issue with is breakers buying vast amounts of product which then inadvertently drives the price up. I have been able to get a box of Topps premier league for around $150 and snag two boxes, that product is now $332.45. 🤮\n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and again,\nexcuse my ignorance.\n",

    "text": "As we move into the holiday buying season, I wanted to revisit my original breakdown on Flagship NBA, now incorporating the new and very relevant formats that have surfaced. This also lets me re-evaluate updated hobby &amp; jumbo pricing and compare how they stack up against retail. My hunch: this release is going to hold some steam, even with the cost-prohibitive Chrome NBA right around the corner.\n\n\n\nThis post is strictly about value. For total production and print-run data, please refer back to my original breakdown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseballcards/comments/1nzvw3y/202526_topps_basketball_breakdown_and_deep_dive/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). \n\n  \n**Hit Frequencies:**\n\nMost formats remain unchanged from the original post, but here are the two formats with newly confirmed info:\n\nCostco Super Box  \n• 1 auto per 6.48 boxes  \n• 15.14 parallels/box  \n• 12.02 inserts/box  \n• 1 # card per 1.42 boxes  \n• 3.45 boxes per relic\n\n  \nBlack Friday Target Value Box  \n• 1 auto per 19.44 boxes  \n• 9.27 parallels/box  \n• 10.26 inserts/box  \n• 1 # card per 1.72 boxes  \n• 1 relic per 8.07 boxes\n\n  \n**Value Landscape:**\n\nAssumes current Blowout prices of $225/hobby, $440/jumbo, and MSRP on all retail SKUs.  \nBlack Friday Value Boxes are now confirmed at $35, and Costco Super Boxes at $45 online (some buyers have shown pricing of $40 in their local store, but my calculations will assume the $45 MSRP).\n\n  \n**Best $ per card**\n\n1) Fat pack — 19 cents\n\n2) Costco Super Box — 21 cents\n\n3) Hanger boxes &amp; Mega boxes — 22 cents\n\n  \n**Worst $ per card**\n\n10) Jumbo- $1.04\n\n9) Hobby- 85 cents\n\n8) Value Box- 30 cents\n\n  \n**Best $ per parallel**\n\n1) Fanatics Value Box — $2.47\n\n2) Costco Super Box — $2.97\n\n3) Value Box — $5.83\n\n4) Black Friday Target Value Box — $5.93\n\n  \n**Worst $ per parallel**\n\n10) Hobby — $37.27\n\n9) Jumbo — $27.59\n\n8) Fat Pack — $13.21\n\n  \n**Best $ per auto**\n\n1) Costco Super Box — $291.60\n\n2) Hobby — $394.23\n\n3) Jumbo — $419.19  \n(This is one of the rare times hobby/jumbo aren't the cheapest auto acquisition formats.)\n\n  \n**Worst $ per auto**\n\n10) Hanger Box — $696.93\n\n9) Black Friday Value Box — $680.40\n\n8) Display Box — $678.30\n\n  \n**Best $ per # card**\n\n1) Fanatics Value Box — $52.80\n\n2) Black Friday Value Box — $60.20\n\n3) Costco Super Box — $63.90\n\n  \n**Worst $ per # card**\n\n10) Hobby — $144.37\n\n9) Fat Pack — $127.05\n\n8) Display Box — $126.70\n\n\n\n**What It All Means**\n\n  \nCurrent hobby/jumbo pricing completely reshapes the value landscape. It’s no longer a guarantee that hobby/jumbo are the best formats- even for autos. Meanwhile, Black Friday Value Boxes (11 packs of 12 vs. the usual 7-pack Value Box) and Costco Super Boxes (15 packs of 14 vs. MLB’s 10 packs) end up being unexpectedly loaded with packs, leading to significantly stronger value positions.\n\n  \nOf course, Hobby and Jumbo still hold exclusive Autos, Relics, and Inserts- so they’ll always have a lane that retail can’t touch. Along the same lines, don't sleep on Black Friday Value Boxes, which also boast a host of exclusives. But if your goal is pure overall value, the clear winners right now are:\n\n  \n1) Fanatics Value Boxes\n\n2) Costco Super Boxes\n\n3) Black Friday Target Value Boxes\n\n  \nIf you stick strictly to Hobby/Jumbo, I totally get it. But there’s really no reason to mess with any other retail format outside of the three above.\n\n  \nHappy hunting! 🏀🔥",

So I think the scammer reused the real holder to make this.\n\nAs I said above, it took me a lot of knowledge and time to realize this was a fake, so I post it to share with other collectors and want to help them avoid fakes.\n\nThanks for reading.",

    "text": "Longtime hockey fan new to the hobby, and have some questions regarding buying hobby boxes and this idea of fresh boxes, avoiding buying boxes from sites online where it’s presumed they’ve already pulled the “case hit”. \n\nBuying cases are way out of the budget for me. Got into this a few weeks ago and have only just now come across this discourse online about the trust in online retailers like DA Card World, Steel City Collectibles, Blowout, etc — in regards to buying boxes on there and being able to trust they aren’t just selling you junk after already pulling the case hit. Is that a legitimate concern with those guys? I’ve seen things about buying stuff labeled “case fresh” but that doesn’t seem to be for a lot of the products.\n\nI bought a 21-22 SP Authentic from Steel City and got a Podkolzin auto and a redeem card for a Mason McTavish /90 auto, so I guess that seemed legit and like normal pulls to me? I see all sorts of opinions online and as I plan to buy more boxes in the future just wondering if I should prefer certain online sites. I imagine a LCS could have the same concerns as well, pulling the case hit, selling the junk. Now I’m a bit sketched out when I see my LCS or online places having a box crazily marked down out of nowhere.\n\nDoes preordering a product help any with this? Ex. Buying a product so fresh you’d almost have to assume they would have no time to find the case hut? Ex. Preordering the latest SP authentic? I guess it all just comes down to the trust built over time with everyone? I really don’t want to do the whole ecard packs either, which theoretically is straight from manufacturer and maybe avoids this concern.\n\nI read the wiki and a lot of posts on this but couldn’t really find a good definitive answer on this. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!",

Is this normal, a scam, or a disciplinary action?\n\n**Update: The customer confirmed Dan Park** [**danny@blowoutcards.com**](mailto:danny@blowoutcards.com) **is one of their representatives. So it's a legit email and the action might just be a disciplinary action to users with Chinese email names.**",
