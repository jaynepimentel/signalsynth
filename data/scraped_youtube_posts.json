These boxes are over $2,500+ per box, which makes this a $5,000+ break for two boxes! This is the last year of licensed National Treasures Football, so it was cool to see what autos they had in the product! We ended up hitting some INSANE patches as well as some of the best receivers in the league, even a Superbowl MVP!
