These boxes are over $2,500+ per box, which makes this a $5,000+ break for two boxes! This is the last year of licensed National Treasures Football, so it was cool to see what autos they had in the product! We ended up hitting some INSANE patches as well as some of the best receivers in the league, even a Superbowl MVP!

The parallels from Egg simply don’t command much value, while the Hangers parallels are both visually impressive and highly desirable. Based on what I’ve seen and opened so far, Hangers also appear to be significantly more loaded with quality hits. Given that combination of strong parallels and consistent value, I wouldn’t be surprised if Hangers become harder to find in the near future.",

Fractures of the hook, often caused by sports (golf, baseball) or falls, cause pain, swelling, and reduced grip strength. \n\nWhat happens is when the edging of the bat knob rubs against the bone; it can weaken it. \n\nMain product of check swinging.",

We hit the 1/1, a HUGE rookie patch auto, and some other awesome big names. Overall, this was an awesome rip, and we are excited to see what to rip next!
