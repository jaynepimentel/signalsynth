I broke that rule with Wemby after three years and that’s it. \n\nLuka looked promising for about three seasons….\n\nAlways buy 5-10 goats for every 1 rookie and you will actually grow a portfolio overtime.\n\nSpeculating and flipping should never be half or most of your portfolio.\n\nYou are not here to make “income” off of cards.\n\nIt’s an investment. Getting 10% a year is more than a winning strategy.\n\nBuy the best of the best cards and you will be sitting pretty while everyone else eventually gets bankrupted or setback by gambling.\n\nLook at these charts…\n\nAll the goats are slowly going up while all the prospects are up and down constantly.\n\nThat Kobe paper was because of gamblers. I bet if you looked at the rest of Kobe‘s market, they’re all slowly trending upwards.\n\nThe best cards have already been printed kids… it’s not in the next seal product. \n\nBuy the singles and you will grow in this game 📈📈📈",
