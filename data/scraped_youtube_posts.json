    "text": "eBay Price Guide + Card Ladder discussion\n\nWelcome back to Pablo's Cards, always selling on eBay. So, eBay has a new feature in their app. So, essentially, open the app, you click on my eBay, and you can just scroll down here to shortcuts and scan cards. Now, you notice mine says early access. However, you may or may not have that. So, just wait. I'm sure it'll be rolled out to everybody. But the thing is is you can click on this here. It's a camera feature. And I have a 1968 um Brooks Robinson's playing card that you can put in here. And let's hopefully it works okay with my finger in there, but let's take a picture of it. And then it'll scan it. And so what you can see here is you can see that it's uh got a couple tabs up the top. Market data, pop report, and item description. You can al also um distinguish between sold and active. And here you see ungraded. You can look at the PSA 9 reports and so on. So, a really cool tool. I'll do it once again just so you can see it. I'll do it with a more modern card, a 2020 Show Otani base card. And you'll see it do its magic, do the work. It'll bring up this card. You select uh the type that it is. It is a base. That's the image. And again, you'll get lots of background information. Uh you can also select uh the months here. You can change it from 3 months to 7 days, 30 days, 1 year, 2 years. So as you can see, a really cool tool at your disposal if you have and utilize the eBay app. And you can utilize it to check graded cards or check raw cards and see what the pricing history has been over the last few days or years or months. So Pablo's cards always selling on eBay.",

    "text": "TOPPS RUINS HOBBY BOXES!  2025 STADIUM CLUB NEW RELEASE PREVIEW!\n\nHey everybody, welcome back to another brand new release preview video. Today we've got the hobby boxes of 2025 Stadium Club. Probably the second best configuration of the three that are out there. You've got mega boxes, which we covered yesterday, hobbies today, and then I don't even know, maybe we'll do the blasters tomorrow, but the blasters are definitely the worst configuration. Let's tell you why you might want to even avoid a hobby box this time around, which is really weird for me to say. Typically, I'd usually advise you to go after the hobby because you get the guaranteed hit or hits in a hobby box. But, however, this time, surprisingly, there's less cards in a hobby box than in a mega box. You can see this little chart that I made yesterday. The MSRP on the mega boxes was 50. There's 144 cards packed in there. It's 35 cents a card. This box right here that now only has one autograph. We'll talk more about that in a minute. This only has eight cards per packs pack and what is it like 14 pack 16 packs times eight? So 128 cards and you're getting less cards and you're paying way more. It's a$12 a card. Essentially, you are paying. And by the way, these are all sold out at MSRP. So, if you can find it for 130, that's awesome. You got a really great local card shop. But if you go and buy this online, they're like 1701 180 right now. Today, they've come down a little bit in one day. But imagine paying say $170 for a box of these. You're paying $120 for one autograph and getting less cards. Man, that's an awful awful pro proposition. just absolutely terrible when you have the mega box out there. So, I just want to put that out there. If you didn't see yesterday, mega boxes are absolutely jam-packed with cards. If you just like stadium club because you like the photography and you want to put the set together, go buy a mega box or two. You could literally buy three mega boxes for the price of one hobby box and get over three times as many cards and probably get maybe two autographs out of those three boxes. You never know. No guarantee of an autograph in the Megas, but there is one guarantee of an auto in this, which is another big issue that I and everybody else have with this product. All the other years of Stadium Club, we've been we've been on YouTube now for 10 years, and every year we've opened Stadium Club, and it's always had two autographs per box, two oncard autos per box. Now, for the first time ever, they decided to tinker with it and they dropped it to one auto. So, less autos. But that's not all either. Last year, they made stadium club really nice. They beefed it up with chrome. There was chrome cards in every pack. There was chrome parallels to chase after. It was really, really nice. It was a great product and stadium club. I thought that that that I thought that was perfect. And this year they got rid of all of it. So there's no more Chrome cards at all. In fact, they even sent out an email to all of the collectors out there ",

He was so happy and that's what this hobby is all about I know he will forever want to open packs of cards. And that's how my dad got me started on cards I just love how it can pass from generation to generation and people get so much joy from it. It's a beautiful thing.",

I pivoted from chasing cards to a focus on collecting for my own personal cards, and I am glad I can come to your channel to watch you do the thing I wish I could do more of! Thank you for bringing excitement to the hobby and for acknowledging that sometimes it isn't the greatest to chase profit when things like personal collections should matter more. I wish you a great rest of this year and so on!",

I hope everybody is having a very pleasant Wednesday out there. We're going to take a look and get some stuff started. will be giving away free cards all night long. Free giveaways. There's one for you right there. DK14 Mats, how's it going, man? Everybody that bought all those singles last night and then I think we did I think we did six rounds of breaks last night, too. All that's in the mail. You'll have that coming your way. Be shown up before you know it. It's already in the mail. So, what we have to start with today is we're going to go ahead and start with a poll for a random team break. What would you like to see us do in a random team break format with the wheel and all of that goodness? Would you like to see 2025 s 2026 series 1 jumbo? Would you like to see 2025 Um, Bowman Chrome hobby, would you like to see a box of Maybe we could go with 2025 Chrome update hobby or would you like to see some signature series from previous years put together? We'll be putting in we mixing in the stadium club which just came out today as well. So, let's go through and take a look at the There's Clean Fry picking up the Yankees. Thank you very much. Let's take a look at what we got. We got Hubby Hysteria, which is pinned for you. That's the closest one to going. We've got the museum collection back again. That's number two. We've got number three, under wrap sign baseball. Number four is tier one. Number five is pristine with hopefully four autos. There's Pixie. Let's get him his moderation badge. Hayden says, \"Uh, can you can I promote my YouTube channel?\" That's fine with me. Black and white right there. We've got top series one and then the Mega Mania round with all of these stadium club megas. I can't believe how many mega How many cards in a mega box of Stadium Club usually like I think of Stadium Club and I I think of not that many cards. Like with a blaster box of Stadium Club, you would usually get like what 30 to 40 cards. Super light box. These things are absolutely loaded with cards. 144 cards in a mega box. Mingo boys picking up the Cardinals. Thank you very much. And it's not even close. We're going to do a random team break to get started tonight. There's TJ picking up the Atlanta Braves. Absolute blowout. 58% voted for a random team break with Stadium Club and the Jumbo. So, we'll start there. Thank you very much for joining us. And the way a random team break works is we usually, by the way, the pick your team breaks, we usually do those once they get into single digits. They'll all go tonight, but um they might just need a little more time for people to pick up their spots. So, in the meantime, we'll go ahead and do a random team break. TJ picking up the Dodgers in the Mega Man round. Thanks, man. TJ will have the the hobby box around tomorrow in the preview video. William picking up the race. Thank you, William. So,",

    "text": "The $16.5M Pokemon Sale Just Changed Sports Cards Forever\n\nA $16.5 million Pokemon card just sold over the weekend. But what does this mean for the sports card market? I'm here to tell you today that I think this might change sports cards forever. And we'll debate why now. Hello sports card investors and welcome to another episode of Cards on the Table. Teapot. Wait, who's this guy over here? We got a special guest here today. Ladies and gentlemen, this is exciting. You want to introduce our special guest here, >> Teamiliari to me. I think a lot of our audience will know Scotty BC cards on YouTube or also of Spitball and Cards which I do with three other guys and Scott uh baseball savant here including using that website often and um he's joining our team officially. >> Yes, fulltime member of the sports card investor team now. >> Yes, >> we're happy to have you here Scott. Congratulations. >> Thank you. I'm excited to debate all these topics with you. It'll be great. >> So Scott will be on our shows periodically. He's going to continue doing his personal content as well. So if you're a fan of his channels, don't worry. that's still going to happen. But he's part of our team. He's now our director of community partnerships. We're extremely happy to have you. >> Thanks for having me. >> And just in time to talk about the biggest sale in trading card history, cuz that's what we're going to talk about off the bat today. We got some other good stories to talk about too, like a breaker who swiped a one of one card on a giveaway and all kinds of fun stuff. But let's start with this $16.5 million sale. Probably a lot of people saw this over the weekend. This was Logan Paul's Pikachu Illustrator card. PSA 10 sold for $16.5 million. That makes it the most expensive trading card ever sold in history. This, of course, beat the record of the $12.93 million dual logo man, the Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant dual logo man that Mr. Wonderful and Shine procured last year. That was a big topic on this show. At that time, that was the most expensive trading card ever purchased. Sports cards had the record. Sports cards, by the way, have historically had the record. Whether it was Wagner cards or 1952 Tops Mickey Manels or there was a Steph Curry one of one that went for a ton of money or of course this, you know, the dual logo mans. Sports cards had the records for the most expensive trading cards ever sold until now. It has shifted from sports cards over to Pokemon. This record $16.5 million sale is now the most ever. And to put that in context, this card sold for more than two of the previous record holders combined. A 1952 Topps Mickey Manel in SGC 9.5. That was the highest Mickey Manel card ever to sell, right? >> And the T206 Wagner in PSA 1.5. Those two sales combined, >> yeah, >> are not as much as what this card, this Pikachu Illustrator card just sold for over the weekend. Um, big deal, right? And so, obviously, this card was super hyped up. It was featured in it was sold by Golden Auctions. It was featured in Ken Gol",

    "text": "BEST VALUE OUT THERE!  2025 STADIUM CLUB MEGA BOXES!  NEW RELEASE!\n\nHey everybody, welcome back to the brand new release preview video. Today we've got Stadium Club for you. And I was really really shocked and amazed when I went to bring in my cases today of these mega boxes. I about hurt my back picking up. It was so heavy. I was like, \"What? Why are these mega box cases so heavy?\" Usually like for Bowman Draft Megas, the Chrome update megas, Chrome Megas, like those things are super light because there's only 32 cards per box. I expected that with this. I couldn't believe how heavy it was. Do you know how many cards in a mega box of Stadium Club? There's more than a hobby box. There are 144 cards in these mega boxes, which is absolutely almost unthinkable to me. It's crazy. So, before we go into this, we're going to cover the mega box video today. We'll do the hobby box tomorrow and I don't know, maybe we'll do the blasters on Friday. But take a look at this price breakdown here. So, we have the mega boxes. They're the MSRP is 50 bucks on those, but the number of cards is 144 cards. Stadium Club is known for its quality, the great photography, the glossy cards and everything. And I I just can't believe that they're giving you that many cards in that more than a hobby box. So take a look. It's 35 cents per card with the megas. The hobby box, which MSRP at 129, by the way, they're selling for $200 a piece online. So Dave and Adam, Steel City, blow, they're all $200 a piece there today, which is just crazy to me, which is what would that work out to be like a $1.75 a card or something like that. Somewhere in that vicinity. And you only get one autograph. So why are we paying so much more per card? Why are we paying just MSRP? $80 more for one auto. I don't know. I guess we'll find out when we rip open those hobby boxes tomorrow. And then the blaster boxes is just another way to flush money down the drain. It's just not very good. Only 40 cards in a blaster box, 62 cents a card. So look, you can buy two blaster boxes for 50 bucks and get 80 cards. or you can just go buy one mega box and almost get twice as many cards for the same price. So, there's your price breakdown of Stadium Club. Wanted to just break that down for you. And um I believe there's still some of these available on Topps's website. They're probably not going to last too much longer. Now, let's talk about this set. By the way, Psalms has our first box. We're opening two and I had to take the second one. I have to take a box for myself here to see what's going on. I mean, you can almost complete a whole set from one mega box. So, there are 200 cards in the set. It's the smallest stadium club set since 2014. So, smallest one in 12 years. It' be a lot easier for you to complete, which is pretty nice. And then, of course, you have your autographs. You have your inserts such the beam teams are back. And there are some other inserts to chase after as well, such as the Savage Sluggers concentration. Yours for the taking. in case of emergency. And also, the",

    "text": "2026 TOPPS SINGLES CONSIGNMENT!  AUTOS, NUMBERED CARDS AND MORE!\n\nGo ahead. Hey everybody, welcome back to another brand new episode of the I guess Tuesday night breaks slash single show. I don't know if we did one last I don't think we did have we haven't done a single show in a little while. It's it actually may have been three weeks since we've done a single show. I think I think the last time I did a single show was before I went to Puerto Rico. So, we're back with some singles. We got a consignment tonight. It looks like we've got about a whole row of I don't know how many cards that would be. It's a whole row in a uh 3200 count box filled up with toploaded cards. So, we have let's see there's some different sections here. We have a relic section. We have an autograph section. We have looks to be a case hit section with some nice team border match. What else? We have a numbered card section. We have an insert section. We have a rookie section. We have a star player section. So, these are all going to be 2026 Topps cards. If anybody else has a consignment that you'd like me to take a look at or if you'd like me to sell your cards, just let me know and could do something like that for uh for you as well. All right, let's go ahead and start with one of the rookies. We're starting out with the number one overall pitching rookie. He's ranked number one on the top 100, even ahead of Bubba Chandler. It's Nolan Mlan rookie card. We're starting everything off at a dollar unless otherwise noted. So, here we go. First one up, N. Mlan. There'll be autographs. And we're we're going to go back and forth, by the way, between singles and breaks. We got some break spots as well. There goes the Marlins. Speaking of breaks, Brett is taking that one. Brett, thank you very much. How about a Roman Anthony 1991 Topps rookie card up for grabs next? Hey Steve, how's it going? Brock says, \"Are the brakes able to make an offer?\" They're all fixed pricing. Yeah, they're all just fixed pricing. Um it everything runs tonight. So, in worst case scenario, if a team's unsold, either I'll take it or I'll just auction it off. Number one, order number one sold. Brock is going to have the number one guy, Roman Anthony. Congratulations on that one. Here's a numbered card. It's going to be Isaac Collins Gold Rookie Cup Blue. It's numbered to 150 for the Brewers fans or Isaac Collins fans out there. MT says, \"Can you DM me? What's the best way to get a hold of your customer service team?\" That's me. I'm the only person that works here. What's your question? I sent you a message back. You said you wanted the show Otani jersey and I sent it to you. I only have extra large. Yep. I saw that you sent me a message skins or Otani like you said Oti in the chat. So yeah, I sent you an extra large Ottoni. That's the only size jerseys that I have or extraarges. It was it was already sent to you. So, it'll be there probably within two days. I think I sent it today. Yeah, I did send it today because post office was closed yesterday. Next, we have this is a P",

    "text": "MEGA BOXES FOR 2026 TOPPS SERIES 1!  NEW RELEASE!\n\nHey everybody, welcome back to another brand new release preview video. The mega boxes of 2026 Tops are due to be released tomorrow. So, if you want to get one of these, you're going to log on to Top's website tomorrow, probably about noon. That's usually when they will drop it. And then you'll be able to pick these up. And I don't think there's going to be like a rush to buy these. They'll probably be available for a few days. But if you like what you see here, that's where you can buy it for the MSRP price. These boxes are $49.99 a piece. So 50 bucks and you are going to get 196 cards. It's 14 packs, 14 cards per pack. Now that's also a reduction in total number of cards. I believe I don't have any mega boxes here on me to check, but I'm pretty sure I'm almost positive that you used to get 16 packs in a mega box. So we're going to rip open three of these in this video and see if this is the way to go. Because when you go out there to Walmart or Target or wherever you buy your retail cards at if you want to buy retail, you're going to see hangers, you're going to see tins, you'll see blaster boxes, you might see some fat packs, and you'll also see these. Now, I broke it down a little bit for you. I made a little graph here just real quick. And here is the prices of everything. And I just wanted to kind of compare how these mega boxes stack up with the other stuff. Blasters are the absolute worst deal. Do not buy blasters. It's like throwing your money away. Especially, take a look at the four different configurations of retail. You're paying about 25 or 26 cents a card for the others, but blasters. Why are blasters 35 cents a card? You're not getting anything extra in there. It's not even worth it. So, hanger boxes were decent. The tins, I really like the tins with that exclusive tin parallel in there. And now we'll check out the mega boxes. The mega boxes are pretty much right in line with what you're going to pay per card for a tin or hanger box. And this this stat is just important especially for people that are set builders out there. You want to get more cards for, you know, more bang for your buck, more cards for your dollar. And that's why I put that stat in there for you. So anyway, thank you very much for watching. I hope you guys enjoy this one. Let's get into it. We'll start off with our first box here. Our sponsor of the first box is going to be Cars Are Us. Now, there's no guarantee of a relic or autograph in here, but I always find these a little bit intriguing because they are they're comparable to hobby boxes. They are, you know, about half maybe a little more than half as much as a hobby box costs with almost the same amount of cards. And I feel like half of the boxes will give you a hit. So, it's not a bad option. Mega boxes might be maybe your best bet if you're a set builder. So, we get our 14 packs here. And let's rip them open and see what we can find. It does say look for those crackle parallels is what we're keeping an ey",

    "text": "HALL OF FAME AUTO!  SERIES 1 JUMBOS FACE OFF!\n\nHey everybody, welcome back to the brand new video. Today we have a face off for you. I know it's a Monday and usually we do mail on Mondays, but the post office is closed today for President's Day. So, I figured let's just go ahead and do this face off challenge that we were going to do this Friday anyway, except we had the new release pristine come out. So, I just postponed this one a couple days. What we have here is we have a brand new 2026 series 1 jumbo box against a 2025 series 1 jumbo box from last year. Same series, both series 1, both high print runs. We'll see if one of the boxes is better than the other. We can definitely tell you the blaster boxes this year way worse. Now the jumbos, are they that much worse? They did make a little tweak and they did make them a bit worse. They took out a relic. There's one relic and one auto per box. Used to be one auto and two relics. So, we're down a a hit, but that's the only difference. Let's see and compare these boxes. Thank you very much for joining us. I hope you're having a very pleasant day. We'll start off with the newest one here and rip a jumbo here for Camille. Camille's going to get all of these. By the way, it's going to be 2026 series 1 starting us off. So, the way this usually works is we'll open the box, we'll go through the cards, and I'll take out the top five cards from each box, and we'll just determine which box was better. Simple as that. So, let's see what we can find here. And good luck to Camille. All right, here we go. We're going to start off with pack number one. Hoping that we can find once again some big stuff. Maybe again there's only going to be one auto and one relic. That's not that much of a difference from last year. Let's keep an eye on what the numbered cards look like. Are there is it going to be a down trend of numbered stuff or not? We'll see. Here's all the base cards. We'll just show those to you. You've probably seen them a bunch if you've been watching our breaks. We got a Jonathan India sand glitter card. The good stuff's in the middle. Unfortunately, the first pack doesn't have too too much going on. And I'm probably not going to take out any of those cards there for the top five maybe pile as I like to call it. On to pack number two. It'll be a busy week. We got a consignment coming tomorrow. We'll be live on whatnot tomorrow with a bunch of 2026 Tops series 1 singles. It looks like those are due in tomorrow to the PO box. And then uh maybe we'll do a couple breaks tomorrow, but Wednesday's our big break day and we will we should have Stadium Club for you on Wednesday along with all the other stuff. Jonathong's a good rookie right there. Sand Glitter, that's a nice one. We'll put that one aside. Shad Mayfield on the first pitch card. People like those first pitch cards and they also can be signed. Although that one's just a base, so probably not too crazy. So far, 042. Next pack up. Vlad Jr. is going to start this one off. There's Jonath once again.",

    "text": "These Cards Are Skyrocketing… Others Are Getting Destroyed (BE CAREFUL!)\n\nI've got 40 card charts lined up that are absolutely going to blow your mind. These things are crazy to look at. They tell such a story about the sports card market. So, we're going into the Arena Club studio. And let's get started. Look at this. Wow. Okay. So, right off the bat, we've got Drake May verse Jaden Daniels. And look at how they have separated themselves. That's Drake May, the light blue line. Wow. So about a month into the football season this year, Drake May for the first time ever passed Jaden Daniels and then [music] Drake May's cards went to the moon, Jaden Daniels cards continued to go down and down and down and look at the separation between Drake May and Jaden Daniels. That is unbelievable. Now here's the big question. Is this going to hold up next season? Will Drake May be that high and Jaden Daniels that low? or will things start to reverse themselves again? What do you think? Hey, let's not forget though about the veteran quarterbacks or the Hall of Famers that have already done this. Dan Marino, Joe Montana, John Elway, their rookie cars. Now, that has been a real investment over the course of the last 5 years. Look at those ones and how they've gone up. Particularly John Elway. [music] Gosh, his stuff has been so hot recently. Great to see these old guys still getting the love. Oh man, two guys not getting the love at all. Zion Williamson and Jaw Morant. Look at the complete collapse of their rookie cards. Both of these guys were so hyped when they came into the NBA in 2019. People were buying their cards like crazy. These are their Prism base cards. They almost hit $900, but look at where they are today. They're around $20 in a PSA 10. It has been an unbelievable fall from grace for both of these [music] guys. Oh, this graph, this is hard to look at. My goodness. Now, this one's interesting. Wendy, is he going to go the route of Zion and Jaw or is he going to rally back? Because look at this chart. Like, he started to really cool off. His stuff was hot out of the [music] gate and then it cooled off a lot, but hey, the last few months started to really pick back up again. Where does it go from here? Can We Wy [music] actually go over his all-time highs as this season goes on. It's going to be fascinating to watch. But instead of putting your money in Jaw and Zion, this is where you should have put your money. Michael Jordan. Look at this. His 1984 star card in particular. There has perhaps been no hotter card in the sports card market over the last few years. Look at how this thing has just [music] taken off. People loving those 1984 star cards. And Jordan, that's the big one that they've been chasing. Look at that chart. Unbelievable. And of course, Jordan's 1986 Fleer card. I mean, that hasn't been too shabby either over the last couple of years. It's rallying back up, but it's still nowhere near its highs from early 2021, as you can see on that chart. But it will probably eventually get there. Uh, but it it's been hot.",

    "text": "SUNDAY NIGHT LIVE BREAKS!  (Whatnot simulcast)\n\nSail across Hey everybody, welcome back to another brand new Sunday night stream. I hope everybody's having a very pleasant Sunday. And it's a long weekend for some of us. I don't have to go to work tomorrow. It's President's Day, so we're off. So, really no restriction on how long I can go tonight. Usually on a Sunday night, I'll probably wrap up shop around 11:00 or so, but we can go as long as you guys want to. So, thank you very much for joining us. We got a Walmart video that is currently being uploaded. I think it is uploaded, but it's not um processed up to 4K yet. Probably another hour for that to happen. So, if you are wondering where tonight's YouTube video is, I was waiting on it, but looks like it's going to take a little bit longer, but uh no problem there. We'll get it upload here around 7:00 or so. So, thanks for joining us. We're going to start off with some museum collection tonight. I see Knucks just grabbed some spots in this round, which is almost sold out. It also comes with series 1, 2026 Topps series 1, a hobby box of that. We got that case sitting over here. We've hopefully we can continue to find some good stuff out of the brand new release. And it also comes with a Bowman Draft Mega Box along with the jersey. So, all of our pick your team rounds pretty much all come with jerseys. I think they all do. So, we have plenty of those to give away tonight. We also have free packs of cards we'll be giving away left and right. We'll start one of those up here in a second. And I just had to go grab my bow and draft megas. It's a little bit of a labyrinth to get over to the other side of this office, even though it's a kind of a small office. Got to like weave around. Chris just picked up a spot. Padres's in black and white. Thank you very much. All right. Well, here's a free pack of cards. Wh Never mind. I didn't load all the free packs of cards in. Let me do that real quick for you so you can get a freebie. It only takes 30 seconds to do that. Free pack of 2026 top series 1. Oh, let's you know what? Let's call it free pack of cards. Free pack of cards. Sometimes we have people that are just Gibby goblins and never even say thank you. And for them, I'll send them a pack of 1990 don. So go to if you're in the chat, you're buying spots, you're participating. You don't even have to buy spots. If you're just here and you're cool off to say thank you and uh participate in the chat, I'll get you a hobby pack of 2026. Go to our profile and bookmark all of our upcoming live shows. Just to remind people to do that. All right, that'll be running here in a second. It just has to populate the list. I'm going to put 50 packs in there just to get us started. And there's one for you right now. Alrighty. So, we only have one team left here in Museum Collection. It's the Nationals. Let's read off who's got what. We're ready to go for the museum collection. Getting us started tonight. I like museum collection a lot. It's pick your team round number",

    "text": "WALMART RETAIL REVIEW!  TINS, HANGERS AND BLASTERS OF 2026 TOPPS SERIES 1!\n\nHey everybody, welcome back to the brand new video. It's the retail review. We went to Walmart this past week. I think this was Thursday right after all the 2026 Top Series 1 came out and we picked up a bunch of the blasters, the hangers, and also the tins. So, here you see what's on the shelf. A lot of basketball and football. And then there's the main target for today. It's all of their baseball card stuff. So, we're going to rip almost $300 worth of retail in this video, and hopefully by the end of the video, you'll know what's best for you. Is it the blaster boxes, which are $25 a piece, or these tins, which are checking in at $15 a piece, or the blaster boxes, which are also now $15 a piece. So, hit that subscribe button. Let's see what we can find. All right, everybody. We've got about $300 worth of stuff. all types of retail stuff that's available at Walmart and also Target and other retail locations. The only thing we're missing here are fat packs. I didn't see any fat packs out at Walmart. So, if I come across them anytime soon, I'll go ahead and check those out and tell you if they're any good. But, we did a video yesterday, the blaster boxes. We'll start there. I only picked up three blasters and I did a lot more with the hangers and the tins. So, since we already covered the blasters, we'll go ahead and do those first. I will tell you that I thought the blasters weren't that good. I think the blasters, at least right now, I'm expecting them to maybe be your worst return on your investment. These cost $25. And they deleted a pack. They just got rid of it. It's just gone. You don't get that seventh pack anymore. Instead of seven pack, you get six. And the cards per pack are the same. So, you get 12 less cards per pack. That's a big drop. It's the equivalent of paying $29.15 for a blaster box if the cards would have stayed the same amount. So, they raised the price and there's not a lot of numbered stuff. We did $250 worth of blasters yesterday. That's 10 blasters. We pulled two numbered cards and that was it. You get a lot of base. You get those spring training foil parallels and not much else. Probably better off going for the hobby of the jumbos, but we'll see how this stacks up against the other configurations out there. I Well, let's start with these three blasters and get them done. Like I said, nothing at all in this first one. There's the spring parallel. Then you get your Titans of the game right there. By the way, somewhere underneath these blasters hidden is the sponsor of this video. It's Justin Murray. So, Justin, thank you very much for allowing us to rip open a bunch of series two or series one, sorry, in this video for you. I'm really getting ahead of myself. Series two. All right, here's our next box. I've been reading the comments. Some people said the tins did them pretty good. So, we'll see about how those tins go. An interesting thing here is the hanger boxes have stayed at 59 cards, which is what they were last year",

The parallels from Egg simply don’t command much value, while the Hangers parallels are both visually impressive and highly desirable. Based on what I’ve seen and opened so far, Hangers also appear to be significantly more loaded with quality hits. Given that combination of strong parallels and consistent value, I wouldn’t be surprised if Hangers become harder to find in the near future.",

    "text": "BLASTERS ARE BAD THIS YEAR?! INCREASED PRICES, LITTLE YIELD. \n\nHey everybody, welcome back to another brand new release preview video. Today we're taking a look at the last boxes. We already covered the jumbo boxes and the hobby boxes and they were pretty good. Can't say that there's much of a anything to talk about negatively about them except the fact that the jumbo boxes got rid of one of your hits. Hobby box have been great. Now we're looking at blasters and I'm not so sure before I even rip any of these how I feel about these blasters. First of all, they went up in price. You don't realize it, but they went up in price. Let's talk about how. Boxes from 2025, they were $25 a piece. Boxes from 2026 are also $25 a piece. Except the big difference here is used to get 84 cards in last year's blaster boxes. Now you only get 72. So, they have taken a pack out. A complete pack is gone. Instead of seven packs per box at 12 cards each, you now get six. So, what does that mean for your price? Well, I do the math. Last year, you got 84 cards at $24.99. That's 29.75 cents a card. This year, the price is still the same for the box, but at 72 cards, you're paying 34.7 cents per card, which is the equivalent of paying the price of $29.15 per box. All you do is take that 34.7, multiply it by 84 cards, and that's what you know, that's what the price increase is is gone to. So, basically, it it's almost like buying the S last year's box for 29 bucks. So, big price increase on these blasters by $4 to $5. And are they going to be worth it? Well, I don't know. We'll go ahead and check it out right now because you've seen these out at Walmart. You've seen them at Target. You've seen them out there. And you might wonder, should I spend some money on this? Should I maybe buy like, I don't know, four blasters, or should I go buy a hobby box? Let's find out. We're going to open up 10 of these blasters in this video. We're going to start with this one right here. This is for Keith. Good luck, Keith. I've been opening a lot of series 1, especially in our whatnot breaks. Hope you can check those out. I'm going to open up tomorrow's breaks and put those on sale here this afternoon very shortly. So, Keith, good luck to you. Unfortunately, one less pack now in 2026. That's just the way things are going. You can see Stars of MLB are going to be back, although they're not in every pack anymore. So you don't have to deal with that every single pack, which is good. I don't know of anybody that liked Stars of LB, was a serious collector last year. Half the cards are going to be those Titans of the game, and the other half are going to be Stars of LB. I like that. I That's a step in the right direction. All right, let's see what we do here. I would like them eventually to maybe make six different little insert sets if that's what they're set on. Maybe just one one of them per pack per box. There's a Kuna on the 91 stars of them will be on the Simei Bayio. There's your design. Basio's a good rookie. It's had a long-term deal with the Orioles ",

That was a pretty solid hit. >> What's the best card you've ever pulled? >> Say Ethan Ho from Destin Rivals. Probably the best card I pulled. >> I would say the best card that I've ever pulled is a Shi Otani Dynasty patch auto number five. say that was my best pull of it. Uh, so I opened a collector booster of uh, Bloomberg for Magic the Gathering and I pulled a refractor Glanor Elves. >> It was out of the Pokemon 151 pack and it was the demigod where it had the Charmander, Charmeleon, and Charizard. So that three in one kind of. So that's probably my best pull. Let's say the Sylveon VMAC Alart from Evolving Scratch. >> U most recently a Max for Stopen Dynasty F1 patch. >> It's probably going to have to be a Wembi 2023 Select card. It was like a out of 99. My son and I pulled a white mezzanine parallel of Wemi like right during his rookie year out of a select. I think it was either a mega or a blaster box that we sold for like 800 bucks raw. So that was the best card we've hit. It was a 2017 uh Topps chrome UFC auto of Conor McGregor Rat of five. >> Probably a Show Otani black cosmic auto out of 10. And that's probably the biggest card I've ever pulled.",

    "text": "TOP 5 HOTTEST SPORTS CARDS!\n\nThe number one card on today's list is not a single card. It is an entire category of cards that has gone up so much over the last few weeks that it is going to blow your mind. I'm here in the Arena Club studio and I'll tell you what cards they are. Now, hello sports card investors and welcome to another top five cards. I hope you're having a wonderful weekend out there. Of course, it is the first weekend in quite a while without football, so that's a little bit sad. But hopefully, you're getting some weekend enjoyment by looking at your cards because chances are you probably own some cards that have gone up a lot because there are a lot of cards going up in the sports card market right now. We'll tell you about them next. And of course, today's top five is sponsored by WhatNot. Whatnot has awesome live auctions every day and night starting at just $1 for packs, boxes, breaks, singles, and more. It's a lot of fun. And if you scan the QR code on your screen or use the special link in our show description below, we will hook you up with $15 in free credit when you sign up for whatnot. All right, let's start the show by taking a quick look at the overall sports card market with a market pulse by market movers. And you can see what I'm talking about. The SEI 500 index of 500 of the most prominent sports cards continues to go up. In fact, since January 1st, just, you know, a month and a half ago, this thing is up almost 6%. It is picking up right where last year left off. Last year it was up over 30%. So far in a month and a half it's up over 6%. This year sports cards have never been hotter. And let's hope this momentum continues to build. But now let's talk about the cards that are going up and down the most. It is time for today's top five. We're starting today with a cold card as we do every week because it is a reminder that sometimes the hot cards featured on this program can [music] quickly turn cold in the sports card market. So, please invest carefully. And that is exactly what happened with CJ Strad, [music] the quarterback for the Houston Texans. Now, CJ Strad had a strong end to the regular season. The Texans actually looked really, really good down the stretch. Many people thought that the Texans were going to make a deep playoff run this year. Of course, [music] their defense especially looked amazing, but Straoud was playing pretty well, but that did not translate over to the postseason. In the postseason, in the playoffs, Straoud struggled with accuracy and timing. He threw multiple interceptions. He failed to generate explosive plays. And honestly, he just didn't look good at all to the point where some fans were calling for him to be benched. And the back of Davis Mills to be brought in. And you can imagine that was not good for CJ Stout's card prices. They unfortunately ended the playoffs on a very, very down note. Let's take a look here in Market Movers. I'll show you what I'm talking about. This is the last 30 days of some of CJ S",

They'd almost certainly be able to provide faster vintage turnaround times if they did.",
