I've had to return cards because the seller's idea of 'mint condition' was very different from mine. Also, eBay's fees are quite high, especially when you're dealing with high-value cards. I've heard of PSA grading but it's not very accessible or easy to understand for newbies. I wish eBay could integrate something like that into their platform.\"", "Customer Concerns:", "1.
