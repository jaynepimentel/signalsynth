    "1. **Grading Service Switch**: Consider switching or adding PSA as a grading service option. PSA is widely recognized and trusted in the collectibles market. Offering PSA grading could increase trust and conversion rates among collectors.",
    "2. **Grading Options**: Instead of switching entirely, eBay could offer both SGC and PSA as grading options. This would cater to a wider range of customer preferences and could increase overall satisfaction and trust.",
