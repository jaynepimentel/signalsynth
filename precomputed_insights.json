    "text": "NEED HELP PLEASE READ To make a long story short I collected cards and was aggressively into the hobby from around ages 8-16ish. I’m now 23 and wanted to jump back u into my old hobby I loved so much. I decided to kick it off with a bang and ordered a jumbo hobby box. As you can see I pulled these two bad boys. From the comps it looks like the Burns is a 450-500ish dollar card with the Teel being 50-100. I wanna sell them to start building back up my old Red Sox Pc. I just moved to Charlotte and there is a card show next weekend of the 28th. Do I bring it there or hit up the LCS trying to strike while it is hot and before comps go down. The reason I’m not really considering eBay is i have never sold anything on eBay before(and admittedly don’t really know how to) and don’t don’t know if people will buy these cards from a seller with no reviews. Please help me get the best bang for my buck",

I now list only things that sell for $20 or more. My profits are up, I get fewer low balls, and I don't waste time sending out 5 items that are going to make me a total of $20.

I am starting to give up, and hate to support scalpers, but I also don’t want to be pushed out of the market waiting on the sideline. I’m definitely not going to camp out at stores and follow distributors like parasites waiting to pounce on every single stocked product, I just want a couple booster boxes from each set and hold until my kids are older, and done to hold for even longer since I loved growing up with Pokemon as a kid.

    "text": "PSA on eBay and shipping issues? Hi all, I am in a weird situation with PSA and am wondering if anyone has had a similar experience and, if so, what the outcome was. So, I bought a 1K+ grail card from PSA on eBay. The listing said \"USPS GA\" under the shipping (See attached). [](https://preview.redd.it/psa-on-ebay-and-shipping-v0-fmkjp11zmnkg1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a3dc6136e9e2b60da443ddaad38174693595f6d) This was next to the card as \"Shipping\" [The shipping service on the sale](https://preview.redd.it/copma0crpnkg1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0af430ba71b9e475590dcb1d98f95ef21b0640a) So, after 4 days, the order updates and a tracking # is provided... for FedEx. The thing is, I have a PO Box and USPS shipping was a must, given FedEx doesn't deliver to PO Boxes. FedEx, in my area has a really bad rep, and I'll leave it at that. I've messaged PSA through eBay (going on 3 days ago) and received no response. I called the PSA (the grading line) and they don't know anything saying eBay is a different department. Furthermore, they don't know how to contact them 🤦♂️. My understanding is that USPS has stopped doing \"last mile deliveries\" for FedEx. So, I fear this is going to get to the PO then get turned right back around. has anyone encountered this? What happened? Thanks!",

If you're worried about your package, you can create a FedEx account on their website and use the tracking number they provided to change the delivery to pick up at a local FedEx/OfficeDepot or OfficeMax store. Once it's delivered to the store ask if you can open the package their to confirm everything is there due to the cost of the item. That's what I did when I couldn't receive my recent PSA Vault package with a moonbreon and other cards for a few days since it required a signature.",

Here’s what happened: * Sold AirPods using a USPS label purchased directly through eBay. * Buyer opened an Item Not Received (INR) case. * Tracking showed in transit but not delivered by the case deadline. * eBay refunded the buyer in full. Okay — frustrating, but I understand INR policy requires delivery confirmation. Here’s the twist: After being fully refunded, the buyer messaged me through eBay confirming they received the item and asking me to remove it from my iCloud account so they can use it. So: • Buyer has the item • Buyer has the refund • I have message proof of possession I contacted eBay multiple times asking for: 1. Seller Protection review 2. Shipping Protection reimbursement (since label was purchased through eBay) 3. Escalation due to buyer admission Each time I was told the original decision stands and that I need to file a USPS claim — which USPS refuses because the label is under eBay’s account. So I’m stuck in a loop: * eBay says file with USPS * USPS says eBay is shipper of record * eBay says decision stands Has anyone here successfully gotten reimbursed in a situation where a buyer admitted receiving the item after refund?",

So, I bought a 1K+ grail card from PSA on eBay. The listing said \"USPS GA\" under the shipping (See attached). [This was next to the card as \\\\\"Shipping\\\\\"](https://preview.redd.it/fmkjp11zmnkg1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7d65dd7e65d2bd442f7a746816e5035bf9cde8a) So, after 4 days, the order updates and a tracking # is provided... for FedEx. The thing is, I have a PO Box and USPS shipping was a must, given FedEx doesn't deliver to PO Boxes. FedEx, in my area has a really bad rep, and I'll leave it at that. I've messaged PSA through eBay (going on 3 days ago) and received no response. I called the PSA (the grading line) and they don't know anything saying eBay is a different department. Furthermore, they don't know how to contact them 🤦♂️. My understanding is that USPS has stopped doing \"last mile deliveries\" for FedEx. So, I fear this is going to get to the PO then get turned right back around. has anyone encountered this? What happened? Thanks!",

By Ben Burrows — January 21, 2026 Share They say a picture is worth 1,000 words ... but sometimes those words come from a different book. When Carlos Beltran was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Tuesday night, collectors might have started searching for his key rookie cards. Here's the problem: One of those cards, Beltran's 1995 Topps Traded rookie features a photo that is not the eventual Hall of Fame outfielder, but instead is a picture of a teammate who never climbed higher than Class AA. But Beltran isn't alone with this photo error — in fact, he's not even the first Hall of Famer to have an image of someone else pictured on his card. Here are seven baseball cards featuring an unfortunate case of mistaken identity. 1995 Topps Traded Carlos Beltran was elected to Cooperstown with 84% of the vote, but anyone hunting for his flagship rookie card will likely be disappointed. Included in 1995 Topps Traded, the front of Beltran’s rookie with the Kansas City Royals actually shows teammate Juan LeBron, an outfielder who would play 12 seasons of professional baseball, but never reached higher than AA in the United States. According to GemRate, Beltran’s mistaken rookie is by far his most graded card with more than 2,400 authenticated by PSA. PSA adds a designation reading “UER: Juan LeBron Pictured” to each. The public record for the card, according to data tool Card Ladder, is the $1,138 paid for a BGS 10 Pristine examp",

(Credit: The PRyan Collection on Instagram) By Patrick Ryan, as told to Darren Rovell — August 07, 2025 Share Last June, I spent $14,047.20 at Lelands Auctions on an autograph book featuring a bunch of signatures of baseball stars, including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. When I won the auction, my plan was to get each page slabbed. But when I came up to the Ruth page, it seemed like the small signature on the large paper could create a special opportunity. Knowing I was going to be at the \"Sotheby's x Fanatics\" auction in September, and Tom Brady was going to be there, I thought about making a GOAT piece, adding Brady to my Ruth ... and then eventually icons from basketball (Michael Jordan), hockey (Wayne Gretzky) and soccer (Lionel Messi). Ryan had the piece authenticated by PSA with the label \"Sports GOATS.\" (Credit: The PRyan Collection on Instagram At the auction, I won a Jackie Robinson card and sat behind Brady, who didn't win any of the cards. When he got up, I said to Brady, \"Hey, I don't want you to leave empty-handed,\" and I gave him a ticket to \"The Catch\" — otherwise known as Joe Montana's epic pass to Dwight Clark — from 1982. Brady famously attended that historic NFC Championship Game as a kid. Brady said thanks, and I asked him quickly if he could sign an autograph, and he obliged. He was going through the motions of his usual signing when he looked down on the page, and his eyes widened — all of a sudden, h",

(Credit: Mister Mancave) By Darren Rovell and Kevin Jackson — July 17, 2025 Share The Hamilton County Coroner's Office identified autograph dealer Brett Lemieux, 45, as the man found dead when police executed a search warrant into a scheme involving fake sports memorabilia in Westfield, Indiana. In a release Thursday, the coroner listed the cause and manner of death as pending, but in a statement Wednesday, Westfield police attributed \"a self-inflicted gunshot wound\" as the cause of death. A Facebook post attributed to Lemieux on the \"Autographs 101\" group sent shockwaves through the sports autograph industry Wednesday morning. In the post allegedly written by Lemieux, he detailed a huge counterfeiting business that sold more than four million items and surpassed $350 million in sales. The crux of the autograph forging operation was based in faking holograms of the largest companies in the hobby, including Panini, Fanatics, Tri-Star, James Spence Authentics, Mill Creek Sports, GT Sports Marketing and others. Lemieux’s primary business was called Mister Mancave, which says on its website that it offers “the largest framed jersey inventory on the web.” A Facebook page for Mister Mancave says the business is located in Columbus, Ohio, but no records of a physical store there exist. Mister Mancave has been incorporated twice in Indiana between 2018 and 2023. In the post attributed under his name, Lemieux said after Kobe Bryant died in January 2020, his company pu",

(Credit: eBay) By Darren Rovell — December 03, 2025 Share A ticket to the first leg of the first Triple Crown will sell Wednesday on eBay, with a chance to beat the all-time record for a horse racing ticket. The ticket to the 1919 Kentucky Derby, which saw Sir Barton win in front of a then-record crowd of 50,000 fans, had reached a high bid of $30,058 as of Wednesday at 10:30 a.m ET, less than 10 hours ahead of the auction close. That price is higher than Sir Barton’s ownership received for the win that day ($20,800), albeit not factoring for inflation. \"It's exceedingly rare and arguably the most significant Kentucky Derby ticket a collector could own,\" PSA's chief ticket authenticator Matt Fuller said. \"The PSA pop on this is only two, and I was lucky enough to see both of them come in.\" Sir Barton was a co-favorite to win the race, but he had not posted a single win in his six career starts. He did a big advantage, however — the horse weighed 4 1/2 pounds less than any other horse in the field. The record price paid for a horse racing ticket was $45,600 for a full 1937 Kentucky Derby ticket, the first of three wins by War Admiral. The record paid for a Sir Barton piece of memorabilia is for the Derby trophy presented to the horse’s owner, J.K.L. Ross, which sold for $71,700 in 2015 at Heritage. Sir Barton swept the Triple Crown races in a span of 32 days, leading wire-to-wire in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. The three races — the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes — were formalized as a group of races in 1875, but the name Triple Crown wasn’t attached to the",

Evaluating a press pass from an all-time NHL momentPress pass said to be from Bobby Orr's 'Flying Goal' sells on eBay — but is it the real deal?July 31, 2025 Press pass said to be from Bobby Orr's 'Flying Goal' sells on eBay — but is it the real deal? Too good to be true? Evaluating a press pass from an all-time NHL moment Press pass said to be from Bobby Orr's 'Flying Goal' sells on eBay — but is it the real deal? Bobby Orr's \"Flying Goal\" to win the 1970 Stanley Cup final is commemorated with a statue outside the TD Garden. (Credit: Getty Images) By Darren Rovell — July 31, 2025 Share One of the main reasons I love collecting tickets is because there is great arbitrage value — especially when the buyer knows something the seller does not. Being aware something historic happened at a certain game and then getting that ticket graded could yield a turnaround of thousands of dollars. That said, there are also sellers who know collectors are seeking this advantage and play the game in reverse. A press credential sold on eBay for $76. on Wednesday night. It was listed as \"Bobby Orr 'Flying Goal' Ticket Press Pass 1970.\" Every detail on the press pass needed to be closely examined. (Credit: eBay) Now, Orr's flying goal is one of the greatest moments in hockey history and represents an iconic collectible that I'd love to own. So, I went deep in my evaluation to decide if I should bid on this lot. Let's take it step by step with the questions I asked as I investigated: 1. Does the item appear authentic? The credential certainly looks like it could be an old pass, though the gold color seems to be a little aggressive for the 1970s. I would expect it to be a mustard yellow. The writing looks authentically faded. It has the markings of what would make sense with the game being \"SC4\" (Game 4 of the Stanley Cup final) and it being versus the \"STL Blues.\" 2. Can you make the leap the item is from the game listed? All the details on the press pass are hand-wr",

(Credit: Getty Images) By Darren Rovell — October 14, 2024 Share It turned out to be one of the most fortuitous ticket finds in collectible history. A 50-year fan of the Oakland A's, who missed many games in 1989 as a partial season ticket holder, sold a lot of 13 full tickets from that season for a whopping $40,100 on eBay. The lot featured 113 bids. His combined cost for the 13 field level tickets, 35 years ago? $130! The reason? One of the tickets, from Opening Day of that season, is the first full ticket from Ken Griffey Jr.'s debut that has ever been seen. “I’m amazed at this unexpected bonus in life and at a very timely moment,” the A's fan told cllct about his new windfall. “I have been trying to complete a decade’s long personal photography project, and it looks like funding might have arrived.” The man, who requested to remain anonymous, originally posted the 13 tickets without any description, but after getting offers of up to $7,000 for the lot on eBay, told cllct it was time to do some research. Before posting the tickets, the man said he has cross-checked the dates with highlights from the A's 1989 season — but he hadn't looked closely at the visiting teams. He had moved from Oakland to New Mexico in retirement and had gone back through his boxes where he had stored his tickets to \"clean house\" after relocating. \"I didn't think of money when I was saving them,\" said the man. \"I kept them as souvenirs.\" To date, PSA has graded 21 tickets to Junior's debut, but a full t",

(Credit: Getty Images) By Matt Liberman — February 08, 2026 Share Fourth-and-1. A little more than 10 minutes remaining. The Super Bowl hanging in the balance. Trailing Miami 17-13 late in Super Bowl XVII at the Rose Bowl, Washington faced that pressure-packed situation in 1983 as the franchise sought its first Super Bowl title. Luckily, the \"Diesel\" was there to carry the day. John Riggins broke a tackle at the line and not only got the first down, he rambled for a 43-yard touchdown that put the then-Redskins ahead to stay in a game they would win 27-17. The jersey Riggins wore that day in an 166-yard performance that won him the game's MVP award sold at the Super Bowl LX Live Auction Event for $470,000, besting its high-end estimate by $270,000. The event marked the 18th year in a partnership between the NFL and Hunt Auctions. Riggins, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1992, played five seasons for the New York Jets before playing his most impactful football in Washington. Additionally, his Super Bowl ring sold for $105,750 \"For me, without the fans, there was no football,\" Riggins said in a statement. \"You gave me something far greater than anything memorabilia can represent. Knowing my teammates and I helped create moments you’ll always remember is the only legacy I need. Now, it feels right to pass these keepsakes along to the people who made them matter in the first place.\" A portion of the proceeds from the auction will go directly toward charities of",

Cooper ransom money more mysterious than the escape itself On this date in 1980, $5,800 of D.B. Cooper ransom money was discovered Only $5,800 of $200,000 in ransom money was discovered (Credit: Getty) By Darren Rovell — February 11, 2026 Share There are a handful of people and stories that never get out of my head. They are, in order of my fascination: The JFK Assassination, D.B. Cooper, the sinking of the Titanic and the 1962 Alcatraz Escape. All of these have one thing in common: How the hell did they ever happen? JFK is pretty self-explanatory. It's such a deep rabbit hole, because, well, the truth is likely more complicated than we will ever know. The Titanic's makers tempted fate by calling the boat \"Unsinkable.\" But how an iceberg wasn't seen because of a combination of hubris and a missing key to a binoculars case is astounding. The 1962 escape from Alcatraz, was led by Frank Lee Morris, a prisoner with a 133 IQ. Not only did they escape from the inescapable, but substantive remnants of their escape, for the most part, were never found in the water. There's one element of D.B. Cooper has than none of the others have. There was an encore. From November 1971 through January 1980, the only unsolved American hijacking wasn't all that well known nationwide. But when an 8-year-old boy named Brian Ingram came across $5,800 in $20 bills that matched the FBI dossier from the Cooper ransom list, the legend expanded its reach. It also made no sense, which added to the mystery. Ingram found the bills bundled together in a Columbia River beach called Tena Bar. Except Tena Bar wasn't close to the FBI flight path, so, either the flight path was wrong or the money would have had to flow down smaller rivers into the Columbia. But how ",

So, eBay has a new feature in their app. So, essentially, open the app, you click on my eBay, and you can just scroll down here to shortcuts and scan cards. Now, you notice mine says early access. However, you may or may not have that. So, just wait. I'm sure it'll be rolled out to everybody. But the thing is you can click on this here. It's a camera feature. And I have a 1968 um Brooks Robinson's playing card that you can put in here. And let's hopefully it works okay with my finger in there, but let's take a picture of it. And then it'll scan it. And so what you can see here is you can see that it's uh got a couple tabs up the top. Market data, pop report, and item description. You can al also um distinguish between sold and active. And here you see ungraded. You can look at the PSA 9 reports and so on. So, a really cool tool. I'll do it once again just so you can see it. I'll do it with a more modern card, a 2020 Show Otani base card. And you'll see it do its magic, do the work. It'll bring up this card. You select uh the type that it is. It is a base. That's the image. And again, you'll get lots of background information. Uh you can also select uh the months here. You can change it from 3 months to 7 days, 30 days, 1 year, 2 years. So as you can see, a really cool tool at your disposal if you have and utilize the eBay app. And you can utilize it to check graded cards or check raw cards and see what the pricing history has been over the last few days or years or months. So Pablo's cards always selling on eBay.",

    "text": "Pay with Consignment Alt Auctions May 30, 2025 Buy Now, Pay with Future Consignments In case you missed it, we introduced a new way to make buying on Alt even more flexible: now you can use a cash advance from upcoming consignments to help pay for auction wins. Whether you’re looking to upgrade your collection or score a grail, this program lets you tap into the value of cards you plan to consign—before they even sell. How It Works Eligible customers can apply the cash advance from their future consignment directly toward the cost of a recent auction purchase. If the cash advance doesn't cover the full amount, you can pay the remaining balance through our standard process. Who’s Eligible? To participate, your consignment must meet these criteria: Cards must be graded or factory sealed Accepted grading companies include: PSA BGS SGC CGC Single-card consignments must be valued at $250 or more If your consignment only covers part of the purchase , the remaining balance must be paid within the standard 14-day auction window Step-by-Step Reach Out to our Alt Experts Contact the Alt Expert team within 5 days of your auction ending to initiate the process through email (support@alt.xyz) or the chat icon in the Alt app. Get a Quote The Sales team will evaluate your cards and send you a batch quote, just like a normal consignment. Approve & Send Once you approve the offer, you’ll receive a cash advance amount. Ship your consigned cards to the Alt Vault within 14 days . Settle the Remaining Balance If your advance doesn’t cover the full purchase, CX will add a charge to your account for the difference. You’ll need to pay that off before we can complete the transaction. Receive Your Cards Once your cards are in and your balance is paid, we’ll transfer your auction winnings to your Alt account. ⚠️ Important: If all steps aren’t completed within 14 days of the auction ending, the purchased cards will be re-listed. Example You win a card for $20,000 . You consign a group of grade",

    "text": "COMC mixup result Well, after a month long battle with COMC, they officially let me know today that they’d not be able to get me my item. I am not happy about this result. They shipped me a Macklin Celebrini hockey card instead of this 1/1 printing plate booklet. An irreplaceable item of my favorite card from the Halo Legacy Collection set. Yes, I realize the Macklin is a hot card, but it doesn’t make up for an irreplaceable item. I did my part and shipped back the Macklin Celebrini rookie card I received when they asked me to. Whoever received my printing plate booklet in the mixup must have decided to keep it. I would ask if that’s you, and you’re reading this, please consider doing the right thing and reaching out to me. I was so excited to receive my item and it’s been a massive bummer ever since they delivered the wrong card to me. If any if you see the #63 printing plate pop up anywhere, please be kind and reach out to me.",

Grew up with the retro X-men cartoon in real time and loved when the movies came out (yes, many people do not like them, but I think I’m such an X-men fan I just watched them with rose colored glasses) I have issues 1-60 of the 90s books and am working on collecting all of them. I promised myself I wouldn’t even try to start collecting the original X-men comics. They are just too expensive and I don’t have that kind of disposable income..... then I joined whatnot. 😕 Over the last several months I have been picking books up because seeing issues in the low 30s ticking away at 2-5$ is just something I wasn’t able to pass up. I now have a weird thing I have noticed about my comic book collecting. If it is a new book, I want it as pristine as possible. If it is an older book, I want the loved version. That #30 is rough. But I think for some reason, it is my favorite of all the lot. I am fully in the low grade is better than no grade camp, but now I just want everyone’s trash copies of early X-men books. Anybody else weird like that ?",

If anyone else reading this submitted anything from this store (Manchester, MO) in October and you're in the same spot...might want to go visit the store... In any case, they offered market price for each card and apologized. It blows to lose some cards that I've had for 25+ years, but I guess they made it right. Maybe they'll find them someday and they'll get returned. Oh well. First and last time using GameStop, though.",

    "text": "1999 Movie Promos Sequential PSA10 I have a sequential PSA10 set of the very first Pokemon movie, with the golden Warner Bros stamp. I got this from someone that graded this himself back in the day, and I don't think many sequential PSA10 of this set exists other than this, if any. To me this collection piece captures one of the key moments in Pokemon franchise history, and is a pure nostalgic collection. Sequential certs are somewhat niche and rather common for modern, but for vintage dating back to 1999 and being a set of four cards released as the first Pokemon movie promos, this would be highly coveted by a serious collector. I would love to keep this as my PC, but I would also be content with selling it for the right price that would support my future plans to start a family. Other than listing it on eBay, what would be the best way to \"advertise\" this collection piece? Thanks in advance.",

Blocked, easy, done. This morning I see a message from a brand new account created yesterday asking the same question if I'd take $40. Replied basically reiterating what I said back in October. Blocked. How do I deal with this? What's stopping them from creating another account to message me and keep low balling? I'm not interested in doing business with this person at all anymore.",

Got lucky with my first 1:1 with this Mookie Betts from the Topps Series 1 2026. I am chasing Ohtani or Yamamoto signed, so I just put this up on eBay. I know it’s better to buy singles but my ripping addiction won’t let me haha. Question, my friend told me that Fanatics is the new place to put good cards up and I should have taken that route. Is that true? I didn’t know they offered a marketplace etc. Basically he said for any cards worth under 1K put it in eBay and anything over use Fanatics. Or for super exclusive ones, use Goldin.",

I patiently and repeatedly offered them the tracking, etc. Item arrived today, and they immediately open a return case with the reason \"changed my mind\". I looked up this buyer on google, and they have an EXTENSIVE negative history on Amazon and other sites. They also have nearly 30000 feedback on ebay. I generally do not accept returns, but I assume I will end up with a false INAD if I don't accept... or a fake item or empty box sent back if I do? Or...?

    "text": "I built a free AI tool that identifies and values sports cards from a photo or description Hey everyone — I’ve been collecting sports cards for a while and got tired of digging through eBay comps every time I wanted to price something. So I built a tool that does it for me. It’s called Collectors Edge AI — you can either upload a photo of a card or type in a description, and it’ll identify the card, pull real market pricing from eBay sold listings, and give you a buy/sell/hold recommendation. It works with baseball, football, basketball, hockey — pretty much any sport. It also handles graded cards (PSA, BGS, SGC) and gives you low/avg/high price ranges. There’s also a “Quick Break” mode designed for live breaks — you can rapid-fire scan cards one after another and it keeps a running total of your break value. It’s completely free right now during launch. No credit card, no catch. I’m just trying to get feedback from actual collectors before I roll out paid plans. Would love to hear what you think. Drop a card name in the comments and I’ll run it through if you want to see how it works.",

The problem was...I labeled what everything was including the value at the time it was stored. All he had to do was read the tags, and take any items worth over $100. Lesson is, NEVER label your inventory. Thankfully, he missed some valuables that were never marked but still a devastating loss.",

Yes, I realize the Macklin is a hot card, but it doesn’t make up for an irreplaceable item. I did my part and shipped back the Macklin Celebrini rookie card I received when they asked me to. Whoever received my printing plate booklet in the mixup must have decided to keep it. I would ask if that’s you, and you’re reading this, please consider doing the right thing and reaching out to me. I was so excited to receive my item and it’s been a massive bummer ever since they delivered the wrong card to me.

    "text": "eBay International Shipping via DHL to Canada I purchased an item on eBay. The shipping method is eBay International. It's being shipped via DHL eCommerce from the USA to Canada. I received an email from DHL in regards to my package. The email stated \"Upon reviewing your order, our systems have indicated that your package may incur duty and/or tax charges\". The email stated I can prepay the duty/tax for my package. It also stated that if I decide not to prepay, my package will still be delivered to me. I'm concerned about that because I don't really believe the package will still be delivered to me if no payment is made since everyone is after money nowadays. The prepayment includes \"tax\" around $5 and \"customs entry fee\" $12.50. My item cost about $40 alone not including shipping cost (all in Canadian Dollars). If I pay for the full amount, but customs do not charge duty/tax on my package, will I get a full refund from DHL including \"tax\" around $5 and \"customs entry fee\" $12.50? If I choose not to make the prepayment, will my package still be delivered to me by DHL? Or will DHL hand over my package to customs to put on hold? Or will DHL hand over my package to a different delivery service provider such as Canada Post? Thank you.",

To maintain marketplace safety, funds earned from your sales will be available for payout within 3 days after delivery confirmation of the item. After we’ve seen ongoing confirmation of successful deliveries, you’ll start receiving your funds again 2 days after the buyer pays. eBay customer service told me that it is because my sales increased dramatically from last year. They've made it clear multiple times that I haven't done anything wrong and there are no restrictions on my account. That is fine and I understand why they do this. However, I'm getting conflicting reports as to if this is permanent or temporary, both from eBay and around the internet. Has anyone else gone through this? Is this a permanent thing or not? Unfortunately, my business model centers on quick sales with low profit margins, so this is negatively impacting sales because I can't get the inventory I need fast enough.",

I am having a problem where despite my listings using ebay's Global Shipping Programme, and their US state being included in that, ebay is not letting them purchase. I have had several buyers from the USA message me to say that they can't buy from me. I checked my settings had included international shipping and it does. I checked that their location is included in the GSP and it is. The first couple of times I contacted ebay and they confirmed that my listings included international postage and that the buyers location should be included, they said that the buyer might be doing something wrong and to contact them. The second time same thing and I showed them the screenshot from the buyer that said the exact same message as when an item doesn't post to your location. Ebay said it might be a technical glitch and to ask the buyer to contact them. Since them I have had several other potential buyers from the USA saying they are having the exact same problem where ebay is saying they can't buy because I haven't included their location. This is also making me wonder how many other people are encountering this issue but not bothering to message me about it? Has anyone else experienced a similar problem? Or could you offer a potential cause, or solution? (I am going to contact ebay but I am not going to hold my breath that they will not just again treat it like a one off buyer problem.)",

    "text": "Lost appeal, was clearly in the right. How to proceed? Howdy. I am writing this after having sold a Canon digital camera. It was listed as used as it still worked and the listing specifically stated the shutter count (how many clicks on the shutter for taking photos) for the camera is unknown. The buyer came back and said they specifically have an issue with only the shutter count (too high) after they said they used software to find out that it was a high count (didn’t state what software or how they got the shutter count). eBay sided with the buyer and after doing an appeal eBay still sided with the buyer. The original listing with the information clearly stating the unknown shutter count was what I referred to as it showed specifically that the shutter count is unknown but the camera functions. This feels like some kind of mistake made by AI. Is there a way to escalate this appeal decision? It seems like I am clearly in the right and the buyer just didn’t like the gamble they took on an unknown shutter count camera. TLDR: sold a used canon digital camera stating in the listing it is used and still works but specifically the shutter count for how many photos have been taken is unknown. Buyer came back and is mad the shutter count is high after they used some third party software to find it out. Did an appeal and eBay still sided with buyer giving them a refund.",

    "text": "Returning an international purchase, is there any cost to me? Just wanting to confirm the process of returning something internationally. Purchased something from Japan about 3 weeks ago. Seller had \"60 day returns\", and \"seller pays return shipping\" on the listing. Reason would be buyer remorse on my part. Shipping was free to me, which was Japan to Canada. Would the seller still have to pay for my shipping label to ship it back? Will I get full refund? Item is in original condition. I've read some conflicting info but it seems I can return for any reason, seller pays for return shipping in this case, is that correct? Also reading stories of people returning items and only getting partial 50% refunds upon receiving. I saw a previous feedback on the seller that was removed that said seller claimed another buyer returned a different item then purchased, so I'm worried the seller might be dishonest when receiving the return. If that happens, would I be able to dispute to get full refund? Just hoping to understand the process better so I can make an informed decision if it is worth it for me or not. Thanks in advance.",

They added the tracking info — it said it was shipping from a city 1,471 miles away. Right away I knew the seller was dishonest. Five days later, there had been no movement on the tracking. I messaged him and asked about it, adding screenshots of eBay’s policy on item location on listings, telling him he is in violation. He offered to send me some other light “right to my doorstep”. I did not respond. Today he sent me a message “Delivered Today” with a photo of my porch from Amazon with a picture of a box. I got home and opened it. It is the other light he offered through messages, not the light I ordered. It came from Amazon with no receipt. I can’t use it. It won’t fit my space. How do I proceed? INAD? INR? The original light still says not delivered when I check the tracking number. There are three days left until the delivery window ends. I am absolutely DONE with eBay, after 26 years.",

I can imagine most of us deal with some unscrupulous buyers, but for the majority we have excellent customers. I can handle a lying buyer, but lying sellers are a special breed. I bought a rather expensive limited edition coin that popped out of its case in shipping and got scratched up on the face. Oh well, accidents happen and things get overlooked in packaging so I opened a return. This seller states that I am to take responsibility for the damage that occurred in shipment, that I had to open a USPS claim on it, and that he would deny any returns. This guy has no idea how eBay works. Ignored all that and opened a case. They then proceed to threaten me with only a 50% refund. They are not top rated and don't have free returns. Proceed to ignore and ship the item back several times better packed then they did. I then receive an email that the seller opened a case against me. They proceed to claim that the item was missing the outer protective wrap (fancy way of being deceptive about the packing material it was stuffed in the package with (they packaged it with the equivalent of very thin foam, no saving it)), and that I sent back only half of the case of the coin, a plain bold faced lie, and continued, directly to eBay, to claim that they would only refund me 50%. Quite funny actually, except that in the end I got my money back, they got the coin back AND the money. I wish I could get this type of service for actual events of deceit considering i've sold over 250 times the amount of items this person has. But no, I can't get it even in events of buyers literally leaving a paper trail of receipts in messages about damages they sustain to items themselves. Just my rant for today. Wish eBay had a better report scenario in this case for people like this, but at least I have my money back so the story ends well there. Also too bad al",

    "text": "Sold a CD player, Manual, and Remote Combo. Buy states he only received an envelope with the remote in it? So I sold a vintage CD player recorder unit. It’s the type that has 2 disc trays, so you can record a CD from one tray to the other. Sony brand. It comes with the manual and remote. I packed this in a medium sized Box. Buyer says he only received an envelope containing the remote. And sent me a picture of the envelope he received with seemingly my shipping label on it. Obviously I didn’t send him just the remote. I sent him a 9.5lb cardboard box that was 16inches long and that’s what I paid for when I bought the shipping label. Buyer said he received a letter from usps and sent me a screen shot of it. The letter says “we are writing to inform you that the item has been damaged in handling by USPS” then the letter goes on about filling missing mail claim and making an insurance claim. So does USPS repackage damaged contents and continue shipping item? So what should I do here?",

    "text": "Question about PSA vaulting cards through EBay Hello everyone, I recently sold a card on eBay. This was the first time someone chose to store their card in the PSA Vault. This intrigued me as I had never heard of this before. Looking into it I guess you don’t have to pay sales tax if you choose to have your slab stored in the PSA vault through eBay. If you plan on re selling the slab, you just keep it in the vault. You don’t have to take new photos. They handle the resell for you.. Seems pretty cool. What are the cons to this besides not actually having your card in hand.",

They have been sitting in boxes since 1999. I logged it all into TCGplayer. Current value listed at about $28,800 with my estimated grades. I have a dealer offering to take it all for $20k pending inspection. I have noticed that there is a wide discrepancy for cards that are listed on TCG player versus recent eBay sales. Like in some cases hundreds of dollars difference. It’s easily possible that at current eBay sales prices, this collection is well over $30,000. More if I take the time to grade the sweeties. At $20k for this type of collection, am I leaving too much value on the table?",

Last year I stopped using the branded tape because of this. I've been using Herkka branded tape on Amazon since then, and had no issues. I ordered another case yesterday which arrived this morning. The tape is clearer on the roll, but smells strongly of glue type chemicals. I checked to make sure nothing had changed in the ad, it did not. I had the same issue a few years ago with another tape company, can't remember the brand. I don't understand the need to do this unless it's cost cutting.",

But 2025 was rough, and it looks like this year may be heading in the same direction. Thankfully, I’ve expanded to other platforms and go live consistently on Whatnot, but it’s still frustrating. I went from making 4–6 sales a day to making that in a week if I’m lucky. The app is currently ranked #25 in the App Store, so it’s clearly not as popular as it once was. I know it’s important for sellers to vocalize the changes we want to see, but sometimes it feels like our feedback isn’t really being heard.",

I assume that I don’t need to answer or comply with this request since it is well behind the return/INAD window and tracking shows successful delivery.

Because I eventually want to move to higher ticket items, it's completely reasonable to expect inventory movement to slow down as a result. But my trouble here is how I should handle \"rare\" items like some antique or vintage item that has little to no sold price history. Do I just do what some people do and price it at some arbitrary high price, then gradually lower the price to get more views and eventually a bite? Or, and I haven't seen this suggested anywhere, do I try having it appraised by some professional? From a quick google search, this can range from $50 to $500, which ultimately poses a risk, since, after appraisal, I might already be at a loss, since I now have to account for the appraisal cost when I list the item. What do I do here?",

Does requiring immediate payment after winning a auction limit bidders at all? My hope was for once a auction was one they would pickup some other items I'm the store. This hasn't happened a single time and waiting for payment on a sold item is annoying. It's like free storage. Just asking for thoughts or other methods of getting sales. Have a great day everyone",

    "text": "Not sure if I can send this complaint to Riot/Riftbound team directly but collecting cards in general is incredibly frustrating lately. Scalpers are the main issues but the secondary issue is when LGS BECOME the scalpers. There is no reason every single one of my 8 LGS in the area should be marked up to TCGPlayer prices. I have been collecting since 1996, Magic, Pokemon, Yugioh, Dragon Ball, Digimon the works. This day and age, collecting is looked at as a side hustle for a lot of people but LGS/LCS were always the last bastion of normalcy. Gonna throw a \"BACK IN MY DAY\" here, stores were disincentivized if they were caught marking up product past a certain point. Riftbound boxes being around $150/$170ish would be around that markup area. Neopets and WOTC used to straight ban stores from getting products, and still do to this day (Neopets) if distribution guidelines are not followed. I really suggest Riot take this route so Riftbound can be fun and affordable to enter more players hands at a local level. Well what about the scalpers you say? They will just buy out the LGS and relist on TCGPlayer. Do what Japan does. - Box limits per WEEK - Plastic cut on Booster Boxes - Some even go as far as cutting the top of packs on sale so they are no longer sealed. Scalpers hate all of this. What are you gonna do, list 36 packs whose seals are all broken? This game is awesome, I want it to thrive. I don't want it to become the frustrating circlejerk sphere that is Pokemon currently. If people cannot buy product affordably, they will leave.",

    "text": "Buyer claims \"Not Received\" despite \"Delivered\" status & paying fees. Am I safe? Hi everyone, I’m looking for advice on a situation with a buyer in Switzerland (I am in Germany). I sold a Funko Pop (around €80) and shipped it via UPS. Since it was an international sale to a non-EU country, customs fees were applied. The timeline: Feb 13: UPS tracking shows \"Import C.O.D. charges have been paid or billed.\" Feb 13: The buyer messaged me privately, very angry about the UPS fees, stating: \"I’ve never had to pay ever import fees for a shipment that is under 150 let alone this one that is 80 I’ve ordered million times from same carrier and Germany never paid that fee.” “I have now paid it however very unhappy with it I would like my money back.\" Feb 16: Tracking officially shows \"DELIVERED\" in Zurich. Feb 17 (Today): The buyer opened an \"Item Not Received\" request, claiming: \"Marked as arrived didn't come... I not got anything.\" The contradiction: In the eBay case, the buyer is claiming they never received the item. However, they explicitly messaged me on Feb 13th confirming they paid the customs fees. Since you usually only pay these fees to UPS upon or for delivery, this proves they were in contact with the courier regarding this package. I've already uploaded the tracking and sent a message in the case pointing out their earlier admission. My questions: Since tracking says \"Delivered,\" am I 100% safe under eBay’s seller protection? Does the fact that they admitted to paying fees on the 13th (matching the tracking) help prove they are lying? Should I just wait until Feb 20th to \"Ask eBay to step in\"? The buyer is being aggressive and said they \"will no longer reply.\" Any advice?",

I haven’t built up my confidence enough to sell on whatnot. I also have a very small bin store near me that I buy from occasionally. It’s hit or miss there with mostly low end Amazon items. That same store does Facebook auctions and I have gotten a few good items on there to make a decent flip. I would like to know something more consistent. Whats everyone’s go to? Liquidation pallets? Return pallets? Wholesale? I have plenty of room for storage. Where are these guys on selling platforms getting all the name brand Jordans, coach bags, etc for such a good deal that the are comfortable selling them on 5 second sudden death auctions? I don’t mind getting a business license if that would give me more access to buy wholesale. I just have no clue where to start.

After doing 10+ failed printing due to blurry label, I've finally figured it out at least on Mac. When you download the label, you need to re-export it to PDF but with Quartz Filter of \"Black & White\". * Download the label at 8.5 x 11. * Open the label in Preview. * File > Export * Format is PDF. Select Quartz Filter > Black & White. * And save. This will generate a bigger file size, around \\~120kB instead of the \\~87kB original download PDF from Mercari. I never have this problem with eBay Standard Envelope. I don't know why Mercari is being crap here. They could just easily give us a higher resolution shipping label.",

Flash forward to today, I had a sale for an older non volatile FCA card. I searched through all my boxes and can’t remember ever pulling that specific card. I refunded and sent a message but he did not respond and is now leaving a bad review. Am I in the right to try and fight for my 100% rating or just move on since it was my responsibility to make sure I didn’t accidentally list the wrong card.

I have only sold a few things on eBay personally and thought I’d give the PSA Vault a try with the lower commissions and their larger reach for views. Plus taking me out of the equation for shipping etc... now that I’m reading more, I am seeing issues with customer support, listings, duties etc. Has anyone on here, more so Canadians for duties/shipping etc, but even in general.... had a good experience? I also have about 15-20 cards I was planning on sending for grading and then have them transferred to the vault fo resale.... but now I’m reconsidering because I hear you can’t as a Canadian, that the cards will be sent back to you and then you have to pay to reship them to the vault. With all this said, these are just some cards I am trying to offload so I can continue to fund my collection addiction 😝 , not being used as a “business”",

Gut says it should have been an 9 or 8.5 at least - or am I being unnecessarily salty? You rate the grading is fair - or should I gamble it and regrade or send to Beckett? Difference between and PSA 8 vs 9 from what I can see of the few sales is around $10k. Not insubstantial.",

    "text": "Guardality Safe Card Protection reviews complaints consumer reports: Does it actually block RFID skimming? My 30-day test. Howdy y'all. I'm a 47-year-old sales rep from Houston who spends half his life in airports and bouncing between client meetings. I've got maybe eight cards in my wallet—credit, debit, hotel keys, transit passes. A buddy of mine got his card skimmed at Hobby Airport last year, and someone cloned it. $1,200 in fraudulent charges before the bank caught it. That got me paranoid. I kept seeing ads for this Guardality Safe Card popping up, so I went down the rabbit hole of Googling \"Guardality Safe Card Protection reviews complaints consumer reports\" to see if it was legit or just another piece of plastic that does nothing. **Does It Work?** I couldn't find a formal \"Consumer Reports\" test on RFID blockers, so I grabbed one to test it myself. **Short Answer: Yes, but you have to understand it's about the material, not magic.** It uses advanced RFID-blocking technology—basically a metallic layer inside the card that creates a Faraday cage effect . When you place it next to your contactless cards, it disrupts the electromagnetic signals that scanners use to steal your data . **The Feeling:** The card itself is ultra-slim—about the thickness of a regular credit card, maybe 1.1mm . You slide it into your wallet next to your cards and honestly? You forget it's there. No bulk, no weight. That's the point. **The Test:** I was skeptical, so I did a real-world test. Before using Guardality, I held my work badge (which has RFID) up to the reader at my office—beep, instant access. Then I put the Guardality card behind it and tried again. **Nothing.** Dead silence. The reader couldn't detect it at all. That's when I knew the shielding was real . I've been carrying this in my wallet for the last month everywhere—airports, grocery stores, crowded stadiums. * **Peace of Mind:** The biggest win. I don't flinch anymore when someone stands close to me in line. * **Func",

    "text": "Quick PSA + Clarifications + Current Pharmacy Turnaround Times Pharmacy Turnaround Times Update: SmartScripts is currently experiencing longer turnaround times due to elevated order volume from the last couple of weeks with the storms and the recent orders. If timing is important to you, Hallandale is the faster option right now. **PSA: Read this before you submit your intake. Your selections are final once you check out.** Hey everyone, just a quick heads-up for anyone new or about to place an order, since this caught a few people off guard recently. Once you complete checkout on your intake form, your selections are final for that order. That means no pharmacy switches, no plan changes, no cancellations, and generally no refunds after submission. The reason is that this is prescription treatment. As soon as you submit, your intake is transmitted to an independent licensed provider for review. If treatment is deemed appropriate, a prescription may be issued and sent to the selected pharmacy very quickly. At that point, the process is already in motion. Before you hit submit, please take a moment to carefully review: \\- Your treatment selection \\- Which pharmacy fulfillment option you chose (Hallandale vs SmartScripts) \\- Monthly vs quarterly plan \\- Your medical history answers A quick review during intake can prevent issues afterward. The one exception is if a provider determines treatment is not appropriate based on your medical history. In that case, your order will be canceled and you will receive a full refund. If you notice a mistake before completing checkout, you can fix it. Use the back button inside the intake form in the upper left corner. Please do not use your browser's back button, as it can cause the form to glitch. We hope this helps prevent confusion and frustration. If you have questions, feel free to ask.",

    "text": "PSA Vault Ebay Auction Id like to share my experience. I recently sold 300 slabs on ebay through the psa vault. I did 7 day auction 0.99. Auctions were smooth as butter, all cards sold at market or above. My only complaint is receiving payment from psa and stripe. Its godawfully slow. I mean like 1970s processing slow. I dont know if its PSA, Stripe, or ebay. My guess its Stripe. But if they dont immediately improve this process. Id be better off auctioning them myself. But other then that I would strongly encourage everyone to utilize this method over selling to PSA, or even vendors. I personally feel this market is going to turn into a competition of who's paying the highest %.",

    "text": "PSA Vault - current \"payment processing\" waiting time Hello everybody, after the whole end of january debacle, things got back to normality for me around 1 week ago and I started again selling via PSA Vault. Now I see that many cards sold on Feb 6th are still in \"payment processing\" status. A couple switched to SOLD already (even from later days) but I cannot seem to find a \"guideline\" for that. Did PSA Vault changed their policy regarding payment processing timeline? I seem to remember someone reached out to support and got a specific answer (i.e. payment is processed xxx days after item shipment or something like that). I am all for quick payments but what really matters to me the most is having clear info (if the new standard is a certain number of days so be it, but I can't find a info anywhere in their pages). Thanks!",

So I started monitoring sales of his Prizm silver cards PSA 9 on eBay and I noticed a significant discrepancy in prices. All the cards in the screenshots are from sales today. Does anyone know why sales range as low has $189 to high as $292 despite all ending on the same day and all were auctions. Any clue?

    "text": "I’m Done Selling Cards on eBay – Sellers Are Left Exposed I’ve officially stopped selling sports cards on eBay. I sell sports cards — from low-dollar cards to high-value collectibles. Everything properly sleeved, protected, shipped with tracking, and handled professionally. Yet I’ve had buyers send photos of “empty envelopes” and claim the card wasn’t inside — even when tracking shows Delivered. And despite doing everything correctly as a seller, you can still be forced to refund. That means: • The card is gone • The money is gone • Shipping cost is gone • Fees are gone • And your time is wasted There is effectively no real protection when a buyer claims the package was empty. A tracking number isn’t enough. Delivery confirmation isn’t enough. The seller carries all the risk.",

    "text": "Enough of these ‘card price’ BS updates and how about a scalper performance update? Headline: Do not buy Booster boxes, and overpriced cards. Do not fall for these new financial posts from scalpers. What the data suggests right now (Feb 2026) (I will highlight in bold interesting points) \\- Sales have not stopped, but they look “thin” on the top chase cards. For example, on PriceCharting (which states it updates prices based on listings that sold on eBay and other marketplaces), some **Fusion World chase cards show \\\\\\~1–2 sales per week volume.** \\- **There’s clear evidence of price inflation vs reality on certain listings.** On one chase card page, PriceCharting shows a big gap between an “eBay price” and a “TCGplayer price” (and then lists recent individual sales). That kind of spread is exactly what you see when listings get pushed up aggressively but the market clears at more varied levels. ￼ \\- Recent sold comps look volatile (**not a smooth upward trend.** For another chase card, the recent eBay sold entries shown include multiple sales in a short window at very different prices (example range shown roughly around the low hundreds up to the high hundreds depending on the specific sale). That pattern usually means the market is being set by scarcity + **speculation rather than steady collector demand.** \\- **Cardmarket “price trend” signals can show sharp cool-offs after spikes.** One Cardmarket listing snippet shows “From” pricing far above the “Price Trend” number (example: “From: 499,99 €” while “Price Trend: 109,90 €”), which is a classic “asking got silly, trend reverted” shape. ￼ So... are DBS prices slowing down, and was it scalpers? Best read based on what I can see: For the hype items (chase alts, markers/promos, manga-type product), it looks like scalpers/speculators definitely played a role in pushing ask prices up quickly, and the **market is now more selective, with patchy volume and wide spreads between listings and sold comps.**",

    "text": "Most Expensive Graded Fusion World Cards (Feb 2026) The latest iteration in my “Most Expensive Fusion World” series: here are the most expensive GRADED Fusion World cards as of February 2026. I’ve done away with categorizing cards by set number as that only invited confusion and trolls, so the above represents the totality of Fusion World, including all booster boxes, Energy Markers and both Manga Booster Sets. Set and card number are indicated, as well as grade received (and from which grading company). Under the cards you’ll find the price the card was sold at, which does not include tax or shipping, as well as the sales date. All sales are from eBay. I also note whether the sale was sold at auction, at the listed price, or if a best offer was accepted. In the interest of keeping variety, I’ve included no duplicate cards in the list, (otherwise the list would just be a bunch of FP-001 sold listings ranked by sale price, which might be an separate and interesting future assignment). The only exceptions to this are FB01-139 and FB06-120, which both appear once as a BGS 10 Black Label and then once as a non-black label PSA/BGS 10. I found this to be a good illustration of the difference between a black label and a regular 10 for the same graded card. As always this is for informational purposes only. If it’s not useful or interesting to you, feel free to move on. **I’ve decided I may just start blocking folks who want to constantly rehash the “people like you are ruining the hobby” argument, when all I’m doing is reporting objective price data. That way they won’t ever see my hard work again which they claim is useless information to them in the first place**. But to the rest of you, enjoy, and happy to discuss anything shown here.",

It arrived with no damage to the box, both front and back. However, there is a deep gash (knife cut?) on both sides of the slab. The authenticity guarantee sleeve were also not damaged by the cut. I did an unboxing video so there is proof that the slab was already damaged when it arrived. Contacted both seller and called ebay but no resolution was reached. Unfortunately, I was on vacation and was not able to open a case within 3 days of delivery and am unable to file a return or item not as described case. I am planning to submit for reholder but I am not sure if the cut is deep enough that it damages the card and gets rejected.",

I've got approximately 10 cards I'd like to get graded quickly, and would be willing to pay the extra money to make that happen. Has anyone on here taken advantage of that sped up return time, and if so, how did it work out? Thanks.",

Is there any interest in them? If so I can take more pictures. I would rather a true collector get them rather than put them on eBay for some company to buy. Other then to take a picture I have never taken them out of the box. I won't reply to DMs, if you have questions/ comments post them here. Thanks! UPDATE Feb 9th: Question for you all, should I try to plug one of them in and power it on? These were in the original box they were ordered in (dec 2014) so they have never been plugged in. Second if the battery is not good should I swap the battery before listing? Also what system do you use to exchange devices? I was thinking just post on eBay and then post the link here? Also a NIB has not been sold for many years and all the sales I could find in the last few years have been used ranging from 600-900. so what price should I list these at? Claude is suggestion 1k-1.5k so is $1.2k reasonable? I am selling these cause I need the money so I cant just give them away. UPDATE 2: If you are a Developer then you can message me or post below and we can work out something. include links to projects you have worked on. Update 3: I have tested all 3 and they work. I took pictures and a video of them booting.",

    "text": "Childhood binder, are these worth something? Hey Reddit, I hope this post is allowed in the sub. I’d really appreciate any help or guidance! I’ve pulled out my old binder from childhood and think there’s potential value in these nine cards. I quickly checked a US price chart website for the holo cards I have, but all the prices are in US dollars. The central card seems like it might be worth a bit, but there appear to be two versions. Mine doesn’t have the Japanese text, but I’m struggling to find a good UK price. What’s the best way to sell these and price them correctly? I’m in the UK and was thinking maybe eBay is the only option, or should I try to find an event nearby to take these to? Anything else I should look for to ensure what I have are legitimate? E.g. the Pichu card seems to be a lighter shade of blue on the back bs the others? Thanks! Edit: Ok... thank you Reddit! This is kind of mad... I genuinely thought I might get some feedback of having a few hundred pounds there and just stick them on Ebay, not quite the scale some people are now suggesting. will be buying some sleeves and \"top loaders\" asap! I'm also sticking to the advice of ignoring my DMs for selling these for now until I understand what I'm actually sitting on.",

    "text": "PSA Vault Holding Card Hostage Back in September I sent this card as well as about 40 others to the vault and sent in a big grading order as well from a PSA staffed drop off event. Long story short I’ve been trying to list this card on eBay via the vault. I thought it was a glitch so I tried on a few different days but it wouldn’t go. I reach out to the vault who within 12 hours respond saying that the card was damaged in shipping and I should talk to my mailman about the damage. I said no- my cards were checked for damage at the drop off event by PSA staff and shipped in to the vault by PSA themselves. The card doesn’t actually look damaged if you see the pics but if it is then they need to fix it, their shipping, their insurance. I waited a few days for a response but nothing came, I wrote in again and nothing. I calle customer service, the rep agreed with me and said they would try to get it expedited. Nothing. Original request to them was Jan 19, response Jan 20th. Now it’s Super Bowl Sunday and I have a PSA 10 rookie auto /10 of one of the team stars and I have no card, in hand or on eBay. Moral of the story, don’t use the vault- they have complete shit customer service and don’t use drop off events for vault shipping, because apparently PSA doesn’t know how to safely ship items.",

    "text": "AC grading/slabs, what's the current consensus on value vs. other grading companies like PSA, Beckett, etc.? Just a general question, seeking some input. If I were to retrieve some of my cards from AC (specifically ones graded and slabbed by AC) and post them on eBay for example, what kind of offers should I expect to get compared to other grading company slabs? Comparable? Way lower? Curious if anyone has had experience doing this, just want to know what to expect. No idea of AC is becoming more mainstream in the community. I have seen some sellers state in their bio that they consider AC slabbed cards to be valued like raw.",

    "text": "Help - ebay authentication and PSA slabs with signature *ON the slab* Hi guys, has anyone gone through this can let me know, I purchased a rather old (and pretty expensive) PSA slab, the slab itself has the artist signature on the outside - I guess the buyer asked the artist to sign the slab at some point. It is going through Ebay's authenticity guarantee verification per the normal process, my question is does anyone know what will happen? Will PSA still authenticate the slab and seal it with an authenticate sticker, will they send it back to the seller, or send it to me the buyer without the sticker saying they can't authenticate? I understand there is no way they will authenticate the signature, which is fine I don't really care. But will they authenticate the slab and card itself? If anyone knows please let me know, being the idiot I am, only thought about this after I paid, and the slab already enroute to PSA authentication. Thank you",

    "text": "I built a free tool to fill those annoying empty slots in your binders (and save ink) Hey everyone! 👋 Like many of you, I have a \"WIP\" binder that is full of gaps. I hate staring at those empty pockets while I wait to find the singles I need. I wanted a way to fill them with placeholders so the binder looks complete, but I didn't want to waste a ton of color ink printing full proxies just for a placeholder. So, I spent my weekends building a standardized tool for this. It’s called **Binder Placeholders**. It’s **free** and open to the community. 🔗 **Link:** [https://www.binderplaceholders.com/](https://binderplaceholders.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=launch_post&utm_content=r_pokemontcg) **What it does:** * **Printable Proxies (Eco-Friendly):** Generates perfectly sized card images. The \"Minimalist\" mode (my favorite) creates a clean, white card with just the Pokémon name, number, set symbol, and rarity—looks professional but uses zero color ink. * **Art Mode:** If you do want the full artwork for visual impact, you can simply toggle that mode on. * **Smart Binder:** A digital 9-pocket page editor where you can drag-and-drop cards to plan your layout before moving physical cards. * **Master Set Tracking:** Quickly browse sets (using TCGDex data) to find missing cards. * **Graded Slab Tracking:** If you have cards that are graded (PSA, BGS, CGC) and sitting in a slab box instead of your binder, you can mark them as \"Graded\" in the app. It will generate a special \"Slab Placeholder\" card for your binder that shows the Grade, Company, and Cert # so you know exactly where that card is. **Why I built it:** I absolutely love the E-Reader era and I'm currently slowly grinding my way through **Skyridge, Aquapolis, and Expedition**. Since those cards are harder to come by (and often graded), I needed a way to visualize the inevitable gaps in my binder without it looking empty. I’d love to hear what you think! Does it help with your organization? If you",

    "text": "eBay prices I'm having an annoyed morning and wanted to open this to discussion. For context, I'm 42M games industry exec aiming to collect the full NTSC NES set, loose. I'm far into this journey and good at pricing and understanding variability where it's deserved. And I'm not talking grails here, I'm talking sub-$100 titles that are regularly available. My core issue: many sellers are adding their assumed eBay costs into the list price so that it nets them the \"value\" of mean price charting value. But the fallacy is that mean eBay price is based on what it sold for on that platform, the actual value is maybe 60% of those prices. B&M shops get away with selling for these prices outright because they have legitimate overhead and convenience, plus an assumption of service and reliability. Also, anytime can walk or and say \"I'll just buy it on eBay\" if the price isn't met or beat. But if you're selling on eBay, the price IS the PC price, and your net is whatever's left of it after eBay is done taking their cut. And within that is a spectrum of variable value based on the actual quality of what you're selling. You don't get to sell an okay condition torn label monster for the mean price on PC plus 30% to \"cover your costs.\" Anyway, really over, would love to hear some opinions.",

For context, here are my previous posts about this situation in order: 1️⃣ https://www.reddit.com/r/psagrading/s/TCUEw0xKG3 2️⃣ https://www.reddit.com/r/psagrading/s/zu3EhQ3lZN Quick follow-up: I stopped by the store today on a whim to ask if there were any updates on my PSA submission. The employee told me there still weren’t any — but then he mentioned the store is apparently closing in about a week and everything is getting transferred to another location. That honestly sounded like a worst-case scenario with my cards already stuck in limbo. So I basically pleaded with him and said I’d just eat the \\~$220 submission cost if he could give me my cards back. I think he realized how messy/unreasonable the situation was because he actually gave me my cards back on the spot — but I didn’t get any refund. I’m relieved to have the cards back, but I’m still out the money. Has anyone dealt with something like this before?

    "text": "I’ve posted a couple times about trying to finally get organized and figure out how to group, list, etc. I have a quick story that will put a smile on all of us who have come up with 0 on a not cheap live break( and question as a result). Last year, I was on Fanatics Live and on an impulse, bought the Braves in a 2 box ‘24 Topps Diamond Icon for a fair amount. It took 4 days to get down to the last few teams. They had to serial one due to the price then it was down to just the Nationals. The Nats were discounted several times over 6 hours and no bites. I offered 50 dollars for the laughs but they took it. 😂 The chat thanked me for “taking one for the team.” The break finally begins. The first box he pulls a Randy Johnson First Inscriptions card and the chat is excited and the host seems to be mildly amused and moves on to box 2. The third card he pulls causes his face to look like he’s going to puke. Here’s the pulls from the 20 cards total 😆. Which leads me to the question.....there’s not a ton of data that I can find. Should get the auto certified, get them graded, or go with raw?",

Unfortunately, I think you are in the minority and I’m talking about the other 99% who aren’t sharing their login or card collection info with family members. Based on PSA’s stance they are going to make it very difficult for family to retrieve cards unless they have an estate plan established. Only 1 in 3 Americans have an estate plan or will set in place and PSA is very vague in their verbiage. All of this could be a moot point if PSA would allow Vault owners to specify beneficiaries, here is what is on their website: “At this time, we do not offer beneficiary forms. Any estate planning, including assigning beneficiaries, would need to be handled separately through your own legal and financial planning. What Happens to My Vault Account If I Pass Away? In the event of a customer's passing, access to the account can only be granted to the legally recognized executor of the estate. To request access, the following documentation is required: Proof of estate management, such as a court order or a record of the deceased person's trust that identifies the individual responsible for overseeing the estate. Please note: We do not accept death certificates as sufficient documentation, as they do not specify the executor of the estate.”",

I had a card on eBay (through the vault) that someone put in an offer for that I accepted almost a month ago. Clearly they waited to see how he did in the playoffs before deciding to pay, since they have 10 days to do so. He didn't do well. They didn't pay. It's now almost 4 weeks later from the day I accepted. It's still stuck in the eBay \"no stock left\" status. I've watched the PSA offer go from almost what the buyer offered to 40% less (though it went back up now it seems). No response from PSA. They are officially broken.",

I told them that I didn’t choose to grade or vault them and that I don’t want to pay extra to have them removed from the vault and then shipped. I actually live very close to the PSA vault, in Delaware, and offered to drive to the vault to pick them up. It took them almost a week to email me back to say the vault isn’t open the public, my cards need to be removed from the vault through my account portal, or they will ship them back to the seller. It was such a giant hassle and I ended up needing to pay close to $50 to get my own cards shipped to me. I emailed customer service about it, three times, and I never got a response.",

    "text": "tZERO - LBOs - And the Rewards for the Loyal Hodlers Alright, I've been going down this rabbit hole for awhile now and I gotta share what I found. This is gonna be long but trust me, stick with it. The Warrant Coincidence So on October 7, 2025, two companies distributed warrants to shareholders. Same exact day. Same 1:10 ratio. Record dates literally one day apart. Those two companies? GameStop and Overstock (Bobby 2.0) For anyone who doesn't know - BoBBY is now owned by Overstock (they bought the brand out of bankruptcy for like $21.5M in 2023). Overstock rebranded as \"Bed Bath & Beyond Inc\" and took the BoBBY ticker on August 29, 2025. Two weeks later, GME announces warrants. Two weeks after that, BoBBY announces the exact same thing. I don't believe in coincidences anymore, especially not ones this obvious. What BoBBY Actually Owns Here's where shit gets interesting. BoBBY/Overstock owns tZERO - a fully SEC-registered, FINRA-approved blockchain trading platform. This isn't some random crypto bro project. This is legit regulated financial infrastructure. tZERO was built by Patrick Byrne (Overstock's old CEO) specifically to screw over short sellers. I'm not even exaggerating here. Back in 2019, Overstock issued a blockchain-based digital dividend through tZERO at a 1:10 ratio (same as the warrants now). Shorts couldn't deliver it. Stock squeezed 65% before the record date. Lawsuits happened. Judge dismissed them all. Said there was \"legitimate business purpose.\" The infrastructure that killed shorts in 2019 still exists. And BoBBY owns it now. Recent News Yesterday morning BoBBY announced their acquiring Tokens.com to build a \"”unified gateway for real estate finance and tokenized asset liquidity.\" Buried in the press release: The platform will use the regulatory and operational infrastructure and platform services provided by tZERO to support capital markets, tokenization, custody, and trading. They're literally activating the blockchain rails. Platform goes live",

Even during the worst of times around 2022 assembly was always a step that took a week at most. How does it make sense that I send a 5 card sub through Gamestop on the bulk tier and it takes 2 months, but I send 2 cards myself in value plus and it takes even longer than that I know they are the busiest company and grade a lot more cards than the 2nd but these times are honestly ridiculous. The fact that gamestop subs take less time than Value Plus completely killed it for me. I cancelled my PSA subscription and will only do GameStop from now on, makes no sense paying $150 a year to get treated purposefuly worse than the gamestop submissions I hope something is being done to throw these times down. This submission originally had an estimated finish date of 12/31. Then it got moved to /2/3 (today) and it obviously wont be done anytime soon Disheartening, disappointing, and just makes me not want to sub again. I know this is just a sob story and everyone is going through the same thing. But it really shouldnt just be accepted as the norm. Hope something changes",

    "text": "Have the Max Black, not sure if I need it now Got the Thor just after Xmas as a little gift to myself. Spent days on end tinkering, trying apps, setting up launchers, getting meta data, installing apps and pushing the thing as far as I can with HD packs and the like. The thing is, now I have pretty much everything up and running, I find myself not really using it. I think I enjoyed the tinkering and problem solving of getting things to run, such as gamehub/ gamenative games, project Zomdriod, the 3ds HD packs and Wii U controls for Mario Galaxy. Now most things either run well or I've hit a wall where they aren't likely to according to various community sources, I find myself going to play something much as Pokemon ZA on Eden or FF Crisis Core on Gamenative and end up just switching to my MSI Claw, Switch 2 or PS5/ PS Portal as generally the MSI handles emulation better or being Windows can just run the games without needing emulation and obviously the PS5 and Switch 2 play things without issue. I love the duel screens, but at nearly 44, outside of nds, wii U or 3ds, I don't really use both unless I'm reading a guide while trying to sort something out as I don't have the brain power to play a game and actually take in anything in a meaningful way other than what's on the top screen without pausing. So I'm wondering, now the tinkering is done, is it worth hanging onto for anything outside of 3DS emulation and smaller form factor than my Claw. The prices for them on Ebay here in the UK are going for around the price I paid for it or more and I'm just worried that now I don't seem to be using as much, it will decrease in value as the batches get shipped out and I'll lose money if I decide to part with it in the near future. Anyone have any hot takes to talk me into/ out of selling?",

    "text": "Price Discrepancies for TCGPLAYER vs. eBay I sell cards frequently across eBay, reddit, and facebook marketplace. I recently sold the Gold Mega Charizard Ex 130 from Phantasmal Flames on facebook for $515. I crossposted it on reddit as well, and was downvoted to oblivion by salty users, saying tcgplayer market was $348 and that my item was overpriced, despite selling for ask within 15 minutes of listing and had multiple ready buyers at $515. This post is a disclaimer for buyers and sellers to explore more than one way to comp their items as I've often found tcgplayer's algorithm for determining market price is often laggard to the accurate market sales. It's very often that I'm \"lowballed\" by those choosing to go based off tcgplayer as reason to price their items and I want those to avoid using that as the golden standard for pricing. Most LCS use tcgplayer pricing as well. **Card (NM copies)** |**tcgplayer** |**AVG of last 6 sold** |**pricecharting (eBay)** |**AVG of last 6** Mega Charizard X 130 |$350 |$377 ($27 difference) |$450 |$445 ($5 diff) Team Rocket's Mewtwo |$376 |$406 ($30) |$403 |$425 ($22) Umbreon 161 |$840 |$957 ($117) |$999 |$1073 ($74) Giratina V 186 |$658 |$598 ($60) |$570 |$559 ($11) Dragonite V 192 |$394 |$371 ($23) |$358 |$350 ($8) Mega Charizard X 125 |$637 |$712 ($75) |$784 |$886 ($102) As you can tell, the difference between market price and last 6 sold for tcgplayer is much greater than ebay. This data was not cherry picked, i just chose popular modern chase cards off the top of my head. I included the Mega Charizard SIR to show that \"market\" on tcg is $637 but there's sales today on eBay at $1000 raw. Often only one sale every few days, compared to eBay's multiple daily I would personally choose to comp based on eBay as there's more sales volume as well as actual images. The centering of a modern card is heavily weighted into the card's price and this is taken out of the equation for tcgplayer, thus leading to lower sales prices. Vintage be",

I do not have a PSA Vault account and was not given the option to create one, so I’m assuming the item will be mailed to me via USPS Ground Advantage, since that’s what is listed. For those who have ordered before from the PSA Vault/eBay and had their items shipped directly to them, how long does it usually take to receive a tracking ID and shipping updates? Thank you in advance for your time and help.",

Market value is around 350 per psa 10 with around 7-16 sold daily according to cardladder, ebay sold, and Pricecharting. My goal with this was to get closer to 87% per sale instead of PSA buyback offers of 72%.

    "text": "The Whale, the Trio, and the Warrant - The $100B Endgame **TL;DR:** We have entered the initiation phase of Gameshire Stopaway. GameStop is sitting on **$8.8B–$9B in cash**, has a CEO with a **$100B incentive structure** (scaling in $10B tranches) to reward performance, and a strategic **Bitcoin Treasury**. Between the eBay \"**Whale**\" thesis and the \"**Trio**\" roll-up (PSA/Funko/Newegg), RC is building a conglomerate. The **Oct ’26 Warrants (GME/WS)** are the surgical tool for high-leverage ROI, protected by a Board-controlled \"Extension Joker.\" # 1. The Financial Fortress: $9 Billion and a Bitcoin Floor As of late January 2026, GameStop’s balance sheet is an anomaly in the retail world. **\\[1\\]** * **The War Chest**: With \\~$9B in cash and liquid securities, GME is no longer defensive. It is a predator. This cash generates hundreds of millions in interest alone, ensuring consistent profitability even before a single game is sold. * **The Bitcoin Factor**: In 2025, GameStop moved to diversify its treasury into Bitcoin (averaging \\~$107k/BTC for 4,710 coins). **\\[2\\]** While BTC has seen recent volatility (consolidating around $79k), it provides a \"Hard NAV\" (Net Asset Value) floor. Crucially, GME recently moved its holdings to **Coinbase Prime \\[3\\]**, signaling they are preparing for maximum liquidity—likely to fund a massive, immediate cash acquisition. # 2. The $100 Billion Incentive: A Tranche-Based Roadmap On January 7, 2026, Ryan Cohen signed a performance-based stock option award that is 100% \"at-risk.\" This isn't a \"mandate\" to hit $100B overnight, but a highly structured reward system for long-term growth. \\[4\\] * The Tranche System: The award is broken down into nine distinct milestones. The first tranche only vests when GME hits a $20 Billion Market Cap and $2 Billion in cumulative EBITDA. Subsequent tranches vest in $10B increments until the $100B goal is reached. * The \"Buy-In\": This isn't a gift of shares. If RC performs, he earns the right to buy sha",

Once the news about the slabs being the weakest and easiest slabs to break as well as numerous evidence of card tampering and unreliable AI grading, people quickly stopped trusting the name, but somehow they are still making sales comparable, or even higher than PSA? If you search any popular modern card, you can see very few sales of TAG, but for some reason they are selling at similar prices. One of the shadiest things about TAG is their social media campaigning. Buying/sponsoring out popular influencers (DeepPocketMonster, RocketCollects, etc), sensational social media reels, etc is it possible that they are buying out overpriced slabs on eBay to look more \"presentable\" or as a legitimate competitor to PSA? I really feel like TAG is not given enough criticism for what can effect the market value of countless PSA investments",

    "text": "Pricing you say? If you think about it, those are the three pillars of the modern card market: grading (PSA), marketplace liquidity (eBay), and now retail + buying power (GameStop). If GameStop is serious about becoming a real player in collectibles, they have to understand live comps the same way we do — not book values, not guesses — actual sold listings. If GME can offer better fees than eBay, faster payouts, or easier trade-ins than dealing with random buyers, that’s huge. Most of us sellers would happily move volume there if the math works. Could be nothing. Could be the groundwork for GameStop quietly building a real collectibles ecosystem.",

I recently sold two high-value cards through Power Packs, which is directly integrated with PSA. • 2007 Jolteon – sold for $18,500 • Drake Maye – sold for $2,000 Total: $20,500. After the sales, PSA restricted my account. I was then told that due to “security and compliance policies,” they cannot provide details, cannot lift the restriction, and now claim they cannot see the transactions or card sales at all. Power Packs has also blocked my access because it’s tied to PSA. So at this point: • My cards were sold • The buyers exist • But I cannot access funds • And PSA will not provide documentation or a timeline I’ve formally requested written confirmation of: • Where the cards are • a copy of my transactions • Whether funds were received • And when they will be released So far, no clear answers. Has anyone here dealt with PSA compliance restrictions after a sale? Did you have to get legal involved? This is not a small amount of money and I’m trying to understand my options.",

I have no idea if I should be asking $200 or $2000 for it. They include 46 Meyer China pieces, 10 R Wallace silver soldered pieces, and 7 glassware pieces. All are in near-pristine condition.

These were: not counterfeit not branded lawful personal property packaged separately disclosed as non-original accessories After authentication, I was notified that while the bag passed, the handmade straps would be discarded and not returned to me. At no point during listing or checkout was there a clear, prominent disclosure that lawful accessories could be destroyed without compensation. There was no checkbox, warning screen, or affirmative acknowledgment explaining that this could happen. Any reference appears to be buried in fine-print terms. I understand authenticators removing non-original items from the shipment — but permanently discarding seller property without a return option (even at seller’s expense) feels like a disclosure and consent problem. I’m sharing this so other sellers know: Do not include replacement or handmade accessories with items routed to authentication Even if they’re legal and disclosed, they may be discarded You may not have opted into authentication, but you’re still bound by its terms",

    "text": "So apparently the new Topps Sapphire Basketball released Jan 22nd with a limited quantity of 500 cases x 10 boxes for a grand total of 5000 boxes. Now that's a pretty limited run these days. Well surfing the net and watching some YouTube vids has shown me that Backyard Breaks had 50 cases, or 10% of the entire print run. Filthbomb was given a similar allocation, so now we are at about 20% of the print run without factoring in a single other breaker that gets allocation from Fanatics. Single boxes are so limited on the secondary market that they are going for 5x. There are a grand total of 23 available to purchase on eBay at the time I'm writing this. Call me a doomer - I don't really give a shit - but this is why you couldn't get Black & White or Bob Ross. And when you cant get those, and you don't want to pay 5x guess where you're gonna go - to the breakers. EQL or not, this is why these products are sold out in less than 5 minutes. Get used to only buying low end products or be a part of the problem and feed the breakers. When I can't get my hands on a case of Platinum Chrome Anniversary Fanatics I will officially be 100% vintage. Good luck everybody.",

Apparently the agent looked over this sale and his history and decided she was going to put in for his account to be suspended, so self-fulfilling prophecy I guess.

    "text": "Sent a $600+ Pokemon card to eBay Authenticator in USPS Priority Small box, they sent it back in a beat up bubble mailer. Is this normal? I’m looking for some insight from anyone who has received a card from eBay’s Authenticity Guarantee. I sold a high-value raw Pokemon card ($600+) and took every precaution shipping it to the authenticator. I used a USPS Priority Mail small box, lined with foam and packing paper, with the card securely protected in a sleeve and card saver between two foam pieces. The card was rejected for \"Listing Accuracy.\" While I understand their standards are strict, I feel the need to specify that I didn't hide anything about this card. I specifically called out a small surface dimple on the back border in the description and included a dedicated close-up photo of it. When it arrived yesterday, the mailer was torn and had visible punctures. Even worse, the inspector’s notes were contradictory: they verified the card is 100% authentic, but then added a note saying \"please update your listing to reflect that the card is altered.\" I pulled this card from a pack myself and have not modified it. I'm not sure I understand why they believe it was altered. Maybe because they didn't like the small surface dimple, but I had already disclosed in the listing. It seems okay upon first look, but I'm stressed that a $600 card was treated so carelessly by the people paid to protect the transaction. A few questions for the group: 1. Is it normal for eBay to basically downgrade shipping from a box to a mailer on returns? 2. Has anyone else had a pack-fresh card labeled \"altered\" by an eBay authenticator? 3. If I find any damage upon closer inspection, what is the best way to hold eBay/the authenticator accountable since they discarded my original protective packaging? Appreciate any advice or shared experiences.",

    "text": "I sell sports cards and use eBay’s standard envelope. I’m now being threatened because of it. This might be the last straw for me. Like the title says, I sell sports cards on eBay. As of this morning, I’ve sold $13,488 in the last 90 days. Of that total, a pretty large number of cards are $20 or less, and they ship with eBay standard envelope. I charge my buyers $1.89 to which I pay $1.32. The additional 57¢ covers my material and time. If you believe eBay, their standard envelope takes 3-5 business days to arrive. It also claims to have tracking so you can follow your order. So that’s what a lot of buyers expect. Now let’s talk about reality. On average, my ESE deliveries are talking about 10 days for most people. Some end up taking up to three weeks. Some don’t ever arrive. “Tracking” is a complete joke. It’s not scanned by USPS at any point. They work with some third party, and the only times they \\*might\\* get scanned are via a sorting machine at specific hubs. As well as being a pretty big seller, I’m also a buyer somewhat regularly. I just looked, and of the last 10 cards I bought with ESE, only four of them showed as delivered. The other six, per eBay’s “tracking” would be considered long lost at this point. If I was a miserable human, I could very easily claim they never arrived, and force the seller to refund me. Even though the card is 100% in my possession. Now let’s talk about the threat. I received this email from eBay this morning. (Sorry for having to copy/paste, I can’t add a screenshot) . . . . . . . . . “Dear Seller, We wanted to remind you that your seller performance has consistently fallen below our minimum standards in the United States. As a result, there’s now a risk that the selling limits will be lowered on your account, and in some cases, you may be permanently restricted from selling on eBay. Here’s what you should do: Check your Seller Dashboard to see where you can improve your seller performance. Go to your dashboard You can also learn",

    "text": "Grading TAG vs PSA (UK seller) I appreciate this question has been asked a million times probably so I guess I am more looking for a discussion rather than a direct answer. I have a pile of various cards to grade from various sets and promos but I am having trouble deciding from a purely financial POV. My black label contenders will obviously be going beckett but for my clean but perhaps not perfect cards Im having the below pros and cons. TAG: Pros - 30 business day turn around,value seems to be competing with PSA on bigger slabs and theres a Pristine chance. Cons - Not as liquid as PSA and am not sure of value across the whole range of cardd. PSA: Pros - Easily most liquid, guarenteed value. Cons - Turnaround, upcharges. I think TAGs look better but that doesnt really matter when selling to market as PSA still is trumps. What are peoples thoughts? Im leaning towards TAG due to the faster turnaround, no upcharges and the chance of Pristine which seem to be selling between psa 10s and BLs but would welcome some advice/conversation.",

    "text": "Vault and eBay In September I went to a PSA submission event at Real Sportscards in Champlain MN, mind that this is a direct PSA event with PSA employees present taking grading and Vault submissions. I did a drop off for a 52 item grading order and submitted another 40ish cards to the vault. PSA was in charge of all packaging and shipping of the vaulted items. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago when I try listing a PSA 10 Jaxon Smith Njigba Panini Legacy Rookie auto pink/gold /10. It won’t list, try it again, it won’t list. Try again the next day, still doesn’t work. I reach out to the vault to find out what’s up and I get a response in about 12 hours. Vault employee tells me the card was damaged during transit to PSA and that I should talk to MY mailman. Uhm no... this was a submission that was transited by PSA from an event, damage insurance coverage is on them. He also sent me a picture of the supposed damage. The card looks exactly like it did in its grade reveal... so #1. I don’t believe that it is damaged at all and that it is just coded wrong and they’re not pulling the card out to actually look at it. I wasn’t notified of any damage when my cards were vaulted. So if it was damaged and couldn’t be sold why would I want it to continue to be in the vault? #2. If it actually is damaged, the rep says specifically in the message that it looks to have been damaged in transit - the cards were all verified prior to the submission with a rep who closely examined them and actually gave me back several other cards he determined to not be eligible for the vault due to damage. So similar to how they force place insurance on us via premiums above the regular fees, what insurance does PSA have on things they ship from events? Compensation is due if the damage was caused by their shipping method. Right? #3. It really sucks to have a vaulted card that could easily bring in multiples of its predicted value due to the Seahawks now going to the Super Bowl. It’s a /10 PSA 10 r",

I tried logging in with a friends account and it worked fine so clearly my account and not my device. I called eBay support first they said maybe psa set max buy thresholds (which seemed weird at most I buy 2-3 slabs a week but often 0) Called psa number (on hold for 30 min) guy said there was some sort of block on my account but didn’t know why and had to check with IT if he can disable it. Haven’t heard back from him yet but just checked and I can bid/buy psa items now (still can’t send to vault) but psa account still locked out",

Paid for express and they received it in August. Still hasn't arrived. It's been stuck in the labels stage for 3 months. The one time I was able to reach support they said it shouldn't have been stuck in labels this long and they're gonna escalate it and call me back. Has anyone waited this long for Beckett to get their card back? I'm worried with PSA buying them the card got lost or at this point, stolen. What do I do? Just continue to wait it out? Idk even how to file a report to get my insurance on it.",

    "text": "what are the opinions on whatnot sellers? I ask for 2 reasons: the first being I had a guy come up to my table at my last show and wanted a pretty sizeable stack of cards. The overall total of the stack was $2,300, and I told him I'd do $2100 for a bulk deal. He grimaced and told me we were so close, and then asked if I could do $1500. \"That's my absolute best, I'm low key taking some stuff off your hands and I gotta carry em rest of the show, catalog and get new top loaders so I'm factoring labor into this.\" I wasn't overly offended, but I told him $2000 was the lowest. He got so mad and basically stormed off and the vendor behind me told that wasn't unusual for that guy and that he's got a name in our community for being a really opportunistic and derogatory whatnot streamer. is whatnot like that all the time? I've never really been on and never spent money on it, but have had a few people tell me \"oh yeah I'm a whatnot streamer, you might've heard of the stream.\" second reason is: is selling on whatnot worth it? I can't imagine it is if your asking for that kinda discount....?",

Price Charting seems to be really good but a vendor was telling me they go off of ebay last sold, but Price Charting had last sold prices on ebay... What’s your go to for tracking your collection?

    "text": "Community PSA: a friendly reminder to slow down, avoid FOMO, and make wise financial choices. Silver has moved *extremely fast recently*. Depending on how you measure it, we’re up well over 200% in a relatively short period of time. **Moves like that should trigger caution, not urgency**. There is **no guarantee prices will stay this high**. There is **no guarantee silver will continue rising like this**. Parabolic moves almost always come with pullbacks. A word about FOMO **This is exactly how people get burned**. Rapid price increases create a fear that “this is the last chance” or that you’ll be priced out forever. That mindset leads to overpaying, overextending, or buying more than you can realistically afford. If you find yourself rushing purchases, ignoring premiums, dipping into emergency funds, or taking on debt because silver “can’t go down,” that’s a red flag. Markets don’t reward panic buying. If you’re stacking slowly, long-term, and within your means, that’s a different story. Just make sure decisions are intentional, not emotional. **Please avoid debt-fueled stacking** A gentle but important reminder: buying silver with credit cards, personal loans, or other high-interest debt is rarely a good idea. If you’re carrying high-interest debt, especially credit cards, that should almost always take priority over adding more metal. Paying down a guaranteed 18–30% interest rate is a far better “return” than trying to time a volatile market. If buying silver means: - Carrying a balance on a credit card - Taking out a loan - Tapping emergency savings then it’s probably worth slowing down and reassessing. **Don’t skip the fundamentals** Precious metals can be part of a broader plan, but they work best alongside a solid financial foundation.

    "text": "I got tired of using 5 different apps to price cards for my shop, so I built my own AI-powered alternative. (Beta Access) I own a small card shop in the UK (Devon based!), and for years I’ve been frustrated with the \"pricing shuffle\"—switching between eBay, a calculator, five different pricing apps, and static price guides just to give a customer a fair price. It was slow, and half the time the data was lagging or inaccurate. So, I decided to do something about it. I’ve spent the last few months building **Price This**—a fully AI-powered intelligent market pricing system. **What makes it different?** **1. The \"Ultimate Average\" (Base Layer):** We don't just guess. We pull data from **PriceCharting, CardMarket, TCGPlayer, and Google results**, extrapolating and averaging their market prices to establish a solid global baseline. **2. The AI & Real-Time Intelligence (Top-Spec Layer):** Once we have that baseline, we apply our **Human-Reasoning AI** and **Official eBay Partner Data**. Instead of just using \"Yesterday's Data,\" the AI detects changes in real-time. It filters out \"wash trading,\" shill bids, and outliers. It \"thinks\" like you do: *\"Oh, one just sold for this much? It's from this set, this era, holds this popularity... therefore the real-time price is THIS.\"* **3. Kiosk Mode:** A feature I built specifically for vendors/traders. You can visualize a trade live, input cash vs. trade credit, and let the app calculate the mathematically perfect deal. **4. The Vault:** Tracks your profit, not just value. See your buy-in cost vs. current value and get volatility warnings before a card crashes. **I’m just one guy building this.** We aren't a massive corporation. It’s just me and a friend, building this for the community. **We launch Early Access on Feb 1st.** Most of the app (including the AI pricing) is free. If you join the beta now, you get a **Founders Badge** and a permanent discount on any future Pro features. I’d love for you to roast it, break it, and tell ",

I've been thinking of bidding on the complete set on the Goldin auction, mostly to display and hold myself, not necessarily for a return. Granted I'd probably sell it in 15-20 years. I'm not really good at valuing these things, I don't really collect anything at all, and don't understand the pokemon market as a whole. Really just the fact that we're at peak hype of Pokemon, especially with the 30 yr anniversary coming up. Do you guys have a general idea of what a set like this is actually worth? Is it foolish to try and buy it given all the hype right now, should I wait for it to die down and circle back in a couple years? Where else can I find complete sets like this? I'd be interested in probably Base Set, Fossil, and Team Rocket as those were like my peak years of participation in the hobby.

Today, I received an offer from PSA to sell one of my cards through PSA Vault, and I accepted the offer and completed the sale. After the sale, I was informed that I cannot receive the payment unless I have a Stripe account. As far as I understand, Stripe payouts are not available in my country. Why is Stripe the only payout option? It feels outdated and extremely restrictive for international users. If I had known that Stripe was required, I would never have accepted the offer or sold the card in the first place. PSA says this is their policy, but allowing international sellers to complete transactions without a valid payout method makes no sense. This is a serious issue, especially for higher-value cards. Has anyone else experienced this problem with PSA Vault or PSA Marketplace as a non\\_toggle international seller? How was it resolved?",

Do you have any recommendations/insight? (i.e. send in bulk, pay for premium service if \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_) For SSPs and other valuable cards, I hear PSA is known to have pretty hefty upcharges for 10s. I've heard anywhere from 200-600. Insane to me. Feels very anti-collector to force somebody to pay more for the same service, especially when they may not intend to sell. Despite how maliciously vile and despicably greedy that is, I'm curious if that's ever a deterrent for you, whether you plan to sell or hold or PC no questions asked. The Kaboom just looks so clean and, if i'm getting premium service to avoid waiting 6 months for my card, then I have to pay 500 bucks just to get it back, i'm gonna be annoyed because I also have some fascination with the BGS black slab, and apparently they don't have that kind of fee. Any other drawbacks/benefits of BGS? Because it seems like PSA is the standard for sports? I see more BGS respect from TCG friends, but rarely see videos/comps of BGS slabs moving. And then I hear about all this PSA drama with the cracking slabs, employee scandals, fake grades, holding company acquiring BGS, yards-yadda-yadda... makes me think, damn, so they all corrupt? maybe i should just get one of those clear TAG slabs lol they look way cleaner than PSA. prob gonna get 7s anyway idek",

At first I thought it I damaged the card but after looking at it for an hour I realized this was not caused by my fingers and that there was a surface issue on it. Centering is essentially 50/50 front and back, corners and edges are clean with no whitening. There is one small surface area on the black EX border where the holo sparkle density is lower (appears like missing sparkles). It is ONLY visible under very close flashlight / harsh angled light. No dent, no crease, no texture break, nothing visible under normal lighting. Trying to decide if this is still realistic PSA 10 territory or if this kind of factory holo inconsistency usually caps at PSA 9. Photos and short video included. Appreciate honest feedback.

I finally spoke to a human today but he was from the “online price guide” department and couldn’t transfer me to anyone. It’s been such a hassle to just pay for my submission. I can’t pay it online for some stupid reason. Most annoying experience ever. It took me like 9 days to get to a human and when I do, he essentially said “I can’t do anything”.

    "text": "Built a price tracker for our precious stuff we collect, looking for feedback Hi guys! I've been collecting for a while now (meteorites, trinitite, some strategic metals) and got frustrated trying to figure out what fair prices actually are. You have to check like 5 different dealer sites, dig through eBay sold listings, find random PDFs from metal traders. Pain in the ass. So I built a site that pulls it all together. Tracks rhenium, gallium, rare earths, meteorites, tektites, LDG, trinitite. Basically the weird stuff that doesn't have a nice clean market price anywhere. It's free, no account needed to browse. If you make an account you can log your holdings and track what your collection is worth over time. Still early and I know there's things missing. Would genuinely appreciate feedback from people who actually care about this stuff! What materials should I add? What am I getting wrong?

Well the breaker said they were out of top loaders that fit the thick RPAs? To make matters worse, they also didn't have the right penny sleeves and looked like they were trying to force it into the regular ones. I made it clear that I wanted it sleeved and was going to grade it - they assured me that someone would put in top loader later before shipping. Well it came in the mail sandwiched between two top loaders (not inside either) with tape holding them together. One corner was visibly damaged. I reached out to them and to their credit they asked how they could make it right - which is where my dilemma is. I've been chasing this card so not a fan of sending it back for refund but I also am not happy at its condition now. Appreciate any ideas on suggestions on how they could \"make things right\".",

    "text": "One of the most popular complaints I see in the Hobby involves folks saying some form of “breakers get all the products”. Then, a hobby simp or Fanatics burner account will always chime in with “Fanatics has a public presale where you can always buy boxes at MSRP!” Is that \\*technically\\* true? Yes. However, my main question is what’s the actual allotment put aside for the public? My theory is that Fanatics releases an EXTREMELY small number of boxes for the general public. I’m talking less than 5% of the total available inventory. It’s the one and only way you can explain how EVERY SINGLE RELEASE “sells out” within 90 seconds. Fanatics wants you to believe it’s because millions and millions of people are flooding Topps.com or Fanatics.com and buying tens of thousands of cases. I think it’s because they release an extremely small amount of actual cases in a public release. That way they can pretend “everyone” has a fair shot at regular pricing, before the aftermarket monster takes hold and suddenly you’re paying 50% to 125% more for the same box. Then, after they offer all their preferred breakers a case or two at MSRP... they come back a week later and say “you’re entitled to another two cases, but now they are \\*market price\\*. Which means even breakers are now paying a 50% to 125% markup, which much like tariffs, those costs are passed on to who? You nailed it. The consumer. 2025 Topps Cosmic Chrome is a perfect example. Fanatics had a “presale” at $335 a box I believe. Now? They are $625-$700 on all resale sites. I don’t even care that Fanatics is shady as fuck with their pricing. They’re a business. They can do whatever they want. What I wish happened, was that much like the lottery or casinos... they had to be 100% transparent about everything. That way if they are only offering ten cases to the public, and then 10,000 cases to breakers... at least we know. And at that point can make a much better decision on what, if anything, we want to buy. And make no mist",

It has eBay's \"authenticity guarantee\", but it is seems suspiciously cheap (£1.9k/$2.5k), and the seller has relatively little feedback (95%+ positive). There's no explanation given for the low price. I'll keep it honest. If it is fake/frankenwatch, I won't know, so I would be entirely reliant on the authenticity guarantee. This would be my first pricey watch so I'm not feeling very confident. I did some brief research comparing the guarantee compared to, for example, Chrono24. I'm feeling very conflicted. How would you approach this if you were brand new to watches? Thanks!",

    "text": "I used to collect as a kid but as of last week I’m back in the hobby. Unfortunately, my reintroduction was through breakers on fanatics as I was unaware of how problematic breaking was (please don’t yell at me! I am now aware of how bad breaking is for the hobby and will not be breaking with card breakers going forward). Anyway, I got a decent hit off a case break. I got the card yesterday and it has damaged in the corner. I didn’t notice any damage on the live stream, nor did the streamer indicate that the cards in the case were damaged in any way. There was no damage to the shipping from what I could tell. The damage is to one corner of the card, and my guess would be that it was damaged while the breaker was loading the card based on how the corner looks. Anyway I messaged the shop that I purchased the spot in the case break through about the damage. They asked what they could do to make this right and I said send a comp card or refund my purchase entirely. They instead replied by saying they can send me an empty card package for the particular case and I can send it back to Topps. They said that they receive cards that are already dinged up, which I can understand. However, I don’t want to risk submitting a claim with topps for a damaged card because if they deny my claim I will be screwed, especially because I have 30 days from date of purchase to raise any issues with an order on fanatics live. Anyway, just looking for some advice from those that have dealt with receiving damaged cards from a break on fanatics live",

At first, I didnt know what to make of all the drama, the trolls, the lore.. I now am a loyal member of the kingdom and if you this post 10minutes you may be too. Before he was known as **King Jonas**, he was simply **Jcardcollector96**, a 29-year-old from Beverly Hills, CA who entered the sports card hobby in 2018 with passion, money, warmth, and an unguarded heart. His rise on Whatnot Sports intertwined with a woman many in the hobby came to know as Gianna — **\"HobbyPrincess\"**. They were not merely collaborators on stream; they were lovers, partners beyond the screen—an unlikely pair who shared late calls, Las Vegas vacations, grand dreams, and a spark that collectors still whisper about. Their bond was intense and lasted 3 months, but when it fractured, the hobby itself took notice. In the aftermath of their break-up, rumors swelled like storm clouds. Across Whatnot, Reddit, Instagram, Medium, TikTok and Facebook, strangers spun tales—some dramatic, some delusional, many untrue. Narratives were twisted, intentions distorted and lies took flight faster than facts could walk. Yet Jonas chose not to drown in that noise. He chose creation. He chose rebirth. He chose the Kingdom... To stumble upon **King Jonas’** hall on Whatnot is not a mere scroll-by—it is to cross the threshold into a Kingdom reborn.

    "text": "Best Sports Card Scanner App I've Found – Baseball Card Values, PSA Grading Estimates & More Been lurking on this sub for a while and always see people asking how to value their collections. Last month I inherited a shoebox full of my dad's old baseball cards from the 80s and 90s – we're talking hundreds of cards with no idea what's junk and what's gold. I spent hours manually searching eBay sold listings before giving up. Tried a couple apps but the recognition was hit or miss. Then a buddy at my LCS mentioned SnapCard and honestly it's been a game changer for organizing everything. **What I actually like about it:** * **The sports card scanner is stupid fast** – just snap a photo of any baseball card, basketball card, or football card and it identifies it almost instantly. Saved me so much time going through that shoebox. * **Real-time price guide pulls from actual sold data** – not just random asking prices. It aggregates from eBay, Goldin, Heritage Auctions, and PWCC so you're seeing what cards actually sell for. * **The PSA grading estimates are surprisingly accurate** – I was skeptical about the AI grading analysis, but I sent in 5 cards to PSA and the app predicted 4 of them exactly right (missed one by half a grade). Also does Beckett grading and SGC grading estimates if that's your preference. * **Collection manager actually works** – I can finally track my card collection value over time instead of random spreadsheets. **Cards it supports:** Works with pretty much everything I've thrown at it – baseball cards, basketball cards, football cards, hockey cards, even my kid's Pokemon cards and some MTG cards I had lying around. Basically covers sports cards and trading card games. **Not perfect though:** * Vintage cards pre-1970 can be spotty on recognition * Wish there was a web version for bulk scanning * Some of the market trends data could be more detailed **Who it's good for:** If you're a casual collector with a pile of cards you need to sort through, or ",

I’m not trying to sell here, just trying to understand where people would recommend getting something like this appraised and what a realistic value range might be? I sent pics and etc to Goldin and the range they gave me was crazy. Like anywhere from a few thousand to like 20 thousand. Which I was like.. I dunno. Seems like a wide range.

Boy it took a lot of money to figure out you can just buy these things. It’s funny because people keep calling it a “hobby”. Only rich people can play this game when every box is 70-100, whole whatnot thing feels like a scam to someone who collected cards as a kid and am now in my late 30s but it’s addictive as hell. I wish I can say ripping wax was better but the return felt even worse with the exception of a single winter Phoenix blaster where I pulled like 300 bucks worth of cards, wish I bought more of those. I count myself lucky plenty of people spend the money and hit nothing.",

If so, what was the process like in terms of insurance and receiving itemized receipts and/or confirmation of your drop-off? And how long did it take to appear in the system? I'm trying to sell a portion of my collection and I'm a bit adverse to shipping them to PSA in case it gets lost en route. I originally thought going to drop-off events near me would be safer, but looking online seems to give me mixed reviews. Sorry if this question has been asked before, but I've only been able to find similar threads talking about drop-off processes and timelines for grading submissions. Thank you!",

Ebay removed a few of them from the “Sold” and Completed Sales” filters, but not sure why.

    "text": "Jimmy's Pokemon Deal Finder - A site that finds deals on Pokemon cards on eBay A few years ago, I got into Pokemon collecting, and I'd look for good deals on cards on eBay. For each card I was interested in, I'd search the card on PriceCharting and compare the listing price to the valuation from PriceCharting. I found this really slow and tedious so wanted a way to automate it. I wrote an eBay scraper and PriceCharting scraper in Python that would show listings from eBay where the listing price was lower than the PriceCharting value. It output the best deals to a text file sorted by price different percent so I could see the best deals. This worked really well and I used it for a while to get some good cards. A few years later, I'd been making programming projects for my personal website and decided to turn the deal finder script into a website. Site: https://www.jimmysdealfinder.com I got it working and posted it to the Pokemon TCG subreddits and had really good foodback on it (as well as some fair criticism that I've used to improve the site). I monetized it with eBay affiliate links and I'm now making about £200 a month from the site, with a peak month of £530 a couple of months ago. I'm really happy with how it's come along, and people seem to be actually using the site to find good deals. I get about 25 users a day and the average engagement time is around 2-3 minutes. I'm planning to expand it to other collectibles such as retro video games, Magic the Gathering TCG, Yugioh, and sports cards. Let me know if you check it out and have any feedback or ideas to improve the site. :)",

    "text": "Ryan Cohen is About to Force Steve Cohen to Sell Him the Keys to a $5B+ Empire Disclaimer: I used Claude to help write this post. If that bothers you please close your eyes. Ain’t no fucking way I’m writing a post like this from scratch, but I do think it’s a good pitch and should be considered. I’m here for good DD, if ai can help, why are we limiting ourselves from discussion? **TL;DR:** Collectors Holdings CEO sits on GameStop’s board for free. PE investors (including Steve Cohen’s family office) need an exit after 5 years. GameStop has $9B+ in cash. The same Steve Cohen who bailed out Melvin Capital in January 2021 may have no choice but to sell Ryan Cohen the dominant force in collectibles authentication. ----- ##The Board Seat That Doesn’t Make Sense (Unless It Does) In November 2024, GameStop appointed Nat Turner—Chairman and CEO of Collectors Holdings—to its Board of Directors. One month earlier, GameStop became an authorized PSA dealer. Ryan Cohen’s board is tight and hand-picked. You don’t get a seat for a dealer agreement. Turner receives no compensation for his board role. He’s the CEO of a company valued at $4.3 billion, sitting on GameStop’s board for free. **Why?** Because when this deal closes, he’ll be one of the largest GameStop shareholders. ----- ##What is Collectors Holdings? Collectors has quietly consolidated the entire collectibles authentication industry: |Brand |Category |Position | |-------|----------------------|-----------------------------| |PSA |Trading cards |#1 globally, 71% market share| |SGC |Trading cards |Acquired Feb 2024 | |Beckett|Trading cards & comics|Acquired Dec 2025 | |PCGS |Coins & currency |Industry leader | |WATA |Video games |Industry leader | |Goldin |Auction marketplace |Premium collectibles | According to GemRate, PSA graded 18.3+ million cards in 2025. **Combined with SGC and Beckett, Collectors now owns 79% of all card grading.** They don’t dominate the market.

I also pack a lot of orders late at night, meaning that if I did book collections for the extra orders that come through late at night, they'd have to then be collected the day after the original collection day. I asked my usual postie if its okay to book one collection and hand over the extras to be scanned when he comes to collect in the morning, and he said it was fine. Done this for months. Today a different employee came to collect (they had manager written on their uniform), and stated that each collection costs 30p per parcel (which is the case if booked direct via RM), and they would \"let me off for today\". Am I in the wrong? For eBay this doesn't make any sense to me, being as the price of drop off and collection is the exact same. Happy to be corrected!",

The 3 cards: 1. 2025 POKEMON MEG EN-MEGA EVOLUTION 178 MEGA GARDEVOIR EX SPECIAL ILLUSTRATION RARE 2. 2025 POKEMON PRE EN-PRISMATIC EVOLUTIONS 149 VAPOREON EX SPECIAL ILLUSTRATION RARE 3. 2025 POKEMON PRE EN-PRISMATIC EVOLUTIONS 156 SYLVEON EX SPECIAL ILLUSTRATION RARE I submitted the card on November 12 , 2025 around noon. Now after 2 months of waiting PSA emailed saying they only received card #1 but card #2 and #3 the Vaporeon ex and Sylveon ex are missing. Did PSA just stole my cards in daylight?? everything is sus to me. How can they lost something I handed to them in person??? I really want my cards back at this point. As you can see the Vaporeon ex and Sylveon ex are super cleaned and centered. That was why I sent them in to grade. Very frustrating right now.",

    "text": "Hot Off London: Pikachu “At the Museum” Jumbo Card Release Heats Up—Is This the Next Big TCG Investment? London’s Natural History Museum just dropped a bombshell for Pokémon collectors—a limited-edition Pikachu Jumbo card, available exclusively at their massively hyped “Pokécology” pop-up shop. Tickets sold out in a flash, and from Jan 26–April 19, 2026, lucky fans will get the oversized Pikachu “At the Museum” card as a gift with purchase. Some quick context: * The artwork features Pikachu visiting the museum under a giant dinosaur skeleton, tying Pokémon’s world to real science. * This card is part of the official launch tie-in with the “Pokécology” book and features exclusive museum-inspired merch. * Can’t make it to London? A small number will hit select UK retailers from Jan 30, but no Pokémon Center stock and no regular online sales! * Profits from the museum shop support the Natural History Museum’s charity. Collectors are scrambling and fan forums are buzzing—some praise the art, some groan about scalpers being shut out (due to its size and accessibility), and others debate: Will this be the next Van Gogh Pikachu explosion or fizzle into another forgotten Jumbo? # But wait—is this actually a good investment, or just FOMO? Let’s break it down with a deep dive into the Jumbo card market and what makes this release unique: # 1. The Appeal of Jumbo Cards * Jumbo cards are typically non-playable, oversized promos—great as collectibles or display art, but not for tournament decks. * Standout art and links to notable events (like museum collabs or anniversaries) can make specific Jumbos highly sought after. * Older/vintage and low-print-run Jumbos have started commanding strong premiums, especially when PSA/BGS graded. # 2. Is This Pikachu Worth More Than Face Value? * Rarity: Pop-up event exclusivity, limited time window, and no global web release boost short-term hype. * Charitable tie-in (NHM profits) and cross-branding with a major museum add “story” and displa",

However, you can clearly see white stress marks on the plastic peg, which tells me they tried to force the joint the wrong way and snapped it. It wasn't crushed in shipping; the box is fine. It was user error on a tight joint. The buyer has already shipped it back. Once I get it, is there any point in asking eBay to step in and review the photos of the stress marks?

To save money from consignment fees compared to directly selling through eBay for cards that are above $100 3. More liquidity. The easier it is to sell, the more likely people will sell their slabs. This could *potentially* raise the value of TAG slabs as they currently sell for around [10% less than their PSA counterparts](https://www.reddit.com/r/taggrading/comments/1o63m3d/charizard_ex_199_tag10_vs_psa10_sold_performance/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Of course, there are exceptions, but this is what I've generally seen on eBay sold listings **PSA gets:** 1. Easy money from consignment fees. PSA's #1 priority, as with any other grading company, is profit. They already accept BGS, SGC, and CGC slabs for the Vault. Adding another grading company to that list wouldn't be hard to implement and the profit margins are huge 2. More PSA membership signups and membership retention I've emailed PSA about this and they said: >Regarding TAG slabs, we currently have no announcements regarding when these will be accepted at the PSA Vault. When and if this occurs, our social media team will make this change public. I figured, if enough people email/poke them about this, they'll see the demand and will eventually make this a reality. I like TAG and I use them for my PC, but a few of my cards I've outgrown and it takes too much work for me in my busy life to sell them myself. At the end of the day, it benefits both PSA for their profits and me as a TAG slab collector",

    "text": "A message to Rhys Hofer and Alex Palmer - admins of the Pokemon Sales Australia Facebook group **UPDATE 12/01** Hello everyone, I had no idea how big this post would get and how many people had either been affected by Rhys' actions or someone else in the group. To those who tried rage baiting or telling me it's a pointless post, might be pointless to you - but there's plenty of others who clearly wanted this to be said. Your rage bait attempts were also pathetic - gotta work a bit harder because unlike you rats, I have thick skin and can handle a bit of abuse without having a sook and reporting you to the admins. I've been speaking privately to Alex about this - and after our conversation, I can admit that my anger towards this group was misdirected towards him. The WTB post, now that I think about it clearly, had no reason to be in the original post - so I have now removed it. I guess I was just finding anything I could to put the admin team down, and I saw the listing (which was directly related to the origin of this post) and pulled the trigger. I won't speak to what he said to me - but I wanted to update you all on the fact that Alex has come to me and asked how he and the group can \\*help with this situation. There is a solution in the works - however reselling will never be banned. As much as I don't like the idea of them (scalpers) having a platform this big to sell on, I've done as much as I can and that's just the way it is. I want to thank Alex for fronting up to the comments below and my messages (I was fairly direct about his admin team's behaviour) as you copped the full front of everything instead of Rhys - the one who SHOULD be responding. \\*help - not completely resolve as the resolution we want is for reselling to be banned, and that's not going to happen. Rhys - after looking at all these comments and seeing all the people you've pissed off and how you've clearly chosen what people to defend in different situations, I think it's time for you to mak",

    "text": "How Much Does an Amazon Agency Charge? A Complete Pricing Guide for 2026 Hiring an Amazon agency can be one of the most important investments you make in your ecommerce business. Whether you’re launching a new product or scaling an established brand, the right agency can accelerate growth, reduce costly mistakes, and take over the time-consuming day-to-day tasks of Amazon account management. But the first question every seller asks is simple: **How much does an Amazon agency charge?** The short answer: **Amazon agency pricing typically ranges from $500 to $10,000+ per month**, depending on: * size and maturity of your brand * number of SKUs * services included * ad spend management * marketplace expansion goals * revenue level and growth targets The long answer requires a breakdown of pricing models and what’s actually included — and that’s exactly what we’ll cover below. # Common Amazon agency pricing models Most Amazon agencies structure their fees using one or more of the following models: # 1. Flat monthly retainer This is the most common structure. You pay a fixed monthly fee for a defined scope of services. **Typical range:** ➡️ $500 – $6,000 per month Best for sellers who want predictable billing and ongoing account support such as: * listing optimization * SEO and keyword research * inventory planning * customer service support * reporting and analytics * account health management # 2. Percentage of revenue Some agencies charge a percentage of your **Amazon monthly sales**. **Typical range:** ➡️ 5% – 15% of revenue This pricing model aligns incentives — the agency grows when you grow — but can become expensive for high-revenue brands. # 3. Percentage of ad spend (for PPC management) If the agency manages Amazon advertising, they may charge based on your monthly ad budget. **Typical range:** ➡️ 8% – 20% of ad spend This often includes: * campaign creation and structure * bid optimization * keyword harvesting * A/B testing * DSP management (if applicable) # 4.",

Ive sent a message through their online portal and have called them a multitude of times, and every time it's told me they're closed for the holidays even though online it says they are open. Never called on a holiday. Today I go to call them and surprise, their hours have changed! So now goes by another day waiting. It's been pretty frustrating so far.

    "text": "This is a brief tutorial on how to find PSA 10 candidates on eBay. Obviously this is a bit tricky, as there’s only so much you can see from photos. Here are some best practices: # 1. Focus On Centering and Corners Surface issues generally require the right lighting and angles to see. Edge issues generally require specific angles. Since centering and corners are the only things you can see well from pictures, we try to make sure everything we buy at least has good centering and sharp corners. # 2. Get the Right Pictures We will always ask for pictures of the card outside of both the top loader / mag and any penny sleeves. This helps us to see the surface as best we can. We try to avoid buying cards without these pictures. # 3. Ask Questions I’ll caution you to ask smart questions. Don’t ask a seller “do you think this is a 10?” But do ask about specific defects you’re unsure of, whether the seller pulled the card himself, or whatever else is relevant. # 4. Read the Descriptions The description sometimes will give you important context. Is the card pack fresh? Is there some issue you should know about? Always read descriptions before buying. # 5. Know Your Seller It’s impossible to do this perfectly, but we try to avoid buying from anyone who grades. The reason is that if someone is an experienced card grader, there’s a good chance *they are only selling ungraded cards that are* *unlikely to 10.* Sellers with high number PSA certifications on their profile likely have graded recently. For example, if a seller has the following certs... **13000000** **13000001** **13000002** **13000003** **13000004** ... then it’s probably best to assume the raw cards they’re selling won’t gem. Side note: we also try to avoid cards pulled from repacks, as we’ve found these often have small defects. # 6. Be Aware of Gem Rates Remember: **Gem Rate** **= PSA 10 Population / Total Graded Population.** Here is an example of gem rate data for the 2024 Drake Maye Silver Prizm #329, from the P",

And that's a bit of a problem, considering I just got a job as a technical artist for a videogame company, and probably need a good machine (my current XP5 is old and trash). Since I'm not exactly made of money, I decided to spread out my purchases over a few months. That was a horrible idea. My whole build used to cost around 3k total, and from RAM alone, now costs 4k. What. The. Heck. But now I'm stuck. Micro-Center is sold out, and the deals they DO have are still flabbergasting. The only hope I have is 200 bucks on an ebay bid, and that's for half the RAM I originally wanted, but that's the current market for ya. I feel like I'm trapped into buying RAM at exuberant prices if I want a new PC in the next 5 years. Any suggestions? Or coping methods besides crying myself to sleep every night?

    "text": "Side Hustle – Passive Income via eBay Dropshipping I want to share a realistic breakdown of how I make money online through eBay dropshipping, specifically for those who need a side hustle This is not a “get rich quick” post, and it’s not recycled advice for experts, this is for beginners (which is where most people go wrong). What I do (in simple terms) eBay dropshipping means: • You list products on eBay • You do not hold inventory • When a customer buys, you purchase the item from Amazon and ship it directly to the buyer No warehouse. No bulk stock. No upfront inventory sitting on shelves. ⸻ Why this works • eBay already has 135M+ buyers searching daily • You don’t need ads, a website, or marketing skills • You leverage existing traffic, not create demand • Entry cost is low compared to most businesses This is why it’s one of the easiest online models to enter if done properly. ⸻ My results (context matters) • I currently operate 15 profitable eBay stores • Each store generates $1,000–$3,000/month • This is consistent income, not one-off wins • I also run an agency helping others do the same I’ll attach screenshots for transparency. ⸻ The part most people screw up (and get banned) Account warm-up. This is where 90% of beginners fail. I use a 4-day warm-up process: • 3 days before opening the store • 1 day after the store goes live Skipping this is why people get limited or suspended and then say “eBay dropshipping doesn’t work.” It does work — just not if you rush it like an idiot. ⸻ Costs & setup (real numbers) • eBay Store subscription: \\~$25/month • Listing limits: up to 250,000 items/month (varies per account) • No inventory costs upfront • No ad spend Limits increase over time as the account is handled properly. ⸻ Automation & scaling I use AI + automation software for: • Product research • Listing creation • Price monitoring • Order fulfillment • Stock checks I also use virtual credit cards to keep payments stable and accounts clean.

Does this mean they are just in a queue waiting to be graded? This is my first time ever sending out cards for grading and I’m not sure what I’m looking at.

Collectors Holdings Inc. owns PSA, SGC, and BGS—three of the biggest grading companies in the hobby. Through its subsidiaries, the company also sells cards on eBay, consigns cards on eBay, operates the PSA Vault, and owns Goldin Auctions. On top of that, PSA is the official authenticator for all cards bought and sold on eBay over $250. Lets not forget they also own Card Ladder the leading data analytics platform and price guide for sports and trading cards. So one parent company now has their hands in grading, authentication, storage, auctions, and direct marketplace sales—often inside the same transaction chain. Congress has previously asked the FTC to review potential antitrust concerns related to consolidation in the hobby, but no public findings or actions have been announced. **WHAT DO YOU THINK**",

Yes yes I know, I can go to the store but sometimes even that fails when looking for specific items or I can’t always get there. It also doesn’t help when there’s constant protests about which stores to support and which ones to stay away from (e.g. Walmart, Target, etc). EDIT; I was NOT expecting this to blow up. I was genuinely just curious as to what people used instead of Amazon if they did stop using it or don’t use it as much. I never said that I was going to NOT use Amazon myself. I also understand that there is no “good” companies to support really and replacing one monopoly with another defeats the purpose. I completely understand if you haven’t or aren’t going to stop using it, that’s fair and everyone has the right to do what they wish within reason. EBay, Costco, Aliexpress, etc are all also very valid. Thanks.",

Location: Texas Hey everyone, recently I was talking with a guy on instagram about trading some of my pokemon cards for some of his sealed pokemon product, we agreed on the trade and I asked him to open it and just ship me the packs inside. He agreed and said I had to ship all my cards to him first and once he verified that received the stuff I sent was correct he would ship out his end of the trade. I was fine with that so I agreed but later my parents found out about the trade and made be block him on all platforms as they believed that he was going to scam me as I have been scammed like this before and the trade value was above $2000. He then messages me on my ebay store threatening me to unblock him or else there will be consequences so I block him again as I do not want to deal with someone who has to resort to threats. He then makes a new ebay account and messaged me today with screenshots that he messaged one of my friends on instagram about me and with screenshots of my linkedin profile threatening to call my job and the local police if I don't compensate him for opening his pokemon box. I offered him to pay him the difference in price of the box sealed vs opened but he only wants the full amount for the boxes which is $800 even though the packs inside are still sealed. My reasoning was that he shouldn't have opened the box in the first place as he didn't even recieve the cards that I would have sent him yet. Shouldn't he have confirmed that I sent him the correct stuff in the trade before opening his product since I was supposed to ship to him first anyway? He says he will file a police report by the end of the week and I do not know what to do please help.",

Also has some more context on what we do and what we sell: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our\\_2024\\_sales\\_statistics\\_as\\_fulltime\\_ebay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our_2024_sales_statistics_as_fulltime_ebay/) The quick rundown though is we (me and my girlfriend) are full-time online sellers who predominately sell Japanese collectables, of which we import directly from Japan. Mostly obscure, vintage, and rare bits rather than modern stuff you can find anywhere. Most of the time we have over 8000 active individual listings on eBay. Notable statistics: Net Sales: $190,465.79 Profit: $99,167.20 Transactions: 5367 Average ROI: 427.51% All of these number are a touch worse than 2024, but not by much. 2023, 2024, and 2025 all had very similar yearly totals which heavily implies we've reached the limit of what we can make with our current system / setup. This year was interesting, particularly due to tons of changes due to our current... administration. Tariffs were a problem for us, because being Japanese collectable sellers 99% of our inventory comes imported straight from Japan. You'd think it's just a 15% increase in buy costs, because that's what the tariffs are, but it's worse than that. Tons of shipping methods skyrocketed in prices, and many international shipping providers pulled out of shipping to the US entirely. UPS and FedEx both hit you with tons of additional fees alongside the 15% tariffs, often times as \"brokerage fees\". I could go into it but the short of it is... screw UPS specifically. So many issues this year. As well, a lot of panic in the early months of year caused a notable dip in our sales. February was the lowest month we had in years, a s",

    "text": "Hey everyone, i hope everyone had a great Christmas and New year. My name is Zac, i am a newer collector from Canada. I started collecting about 5 months ago and quickly fell in love with the hobby and ripping packs, learning the market, and sharing it with family has been an awesome experience. I’ve been an NFL fan my whole life (proud eagles fan 🦅) and i played cornerback for several years, so i am very passionate about sports especially football. Football cards are my main focus, but I also enjoy baseball, basketball, and soccer including the collegiate version of football and basketball. I’m finishing high school in a few months and would love to start building a small sports cards business or side hustle, i think it would be a great opportunity to learn how the industry works and gain experience and knowledge. I am very hard working, fast learning and a great negotiator and i think most importantly, i am passionate. Any help would mean a lot to me so feel free to contact me about anything. I’d also really appreciate advice on: • How you got started selling or trading • Best platforms for Canadians (eBay, Whatnot, shows, etc.) • Shipping/packing efficiently and safely • Any common beginner mistakes to avoid I’m not sitting on a huge collection or big money, i am just trying to learn, work hard, and do things the right way. Any insight or experiences you’re willing to share would mean a lot. I know its not going to be easy and i am ready for it. I have a good sized collection with big hits and good pulls and everything is scanned and organized. If anyone wants to check it out i will be more than happy to show you. Thanks for taking the time to read, i really appreciate this community and i am looking forward to giving you guys updates on how it is going:) Contact me if you guys have any questions and have a great day!",

    "text": "I recently sold a card for $33.89 and as usual, for something under $50, I sent it PWE. I pack and drop off my orders at the same time everyday so everything is out within 24 hours. When I leave for the post office I mark the PWEs as shipped. The day after I marked this order as shipped, I receive a message from the customer asking if I shipped and what the tracking number was. I informed them that I shipped the order yesterday and that I sent it PWE. They tell me that their mailman is a thief and if it doesn't have tracking they won't get the order. I tell them if they don't get the order by the estimated delivery time, we'll figure something out(I'd make them wait a couple more days and then refund them\"). Today they messaged me with a refund request saying that they don't trust that they'll receive their order since it doesn't have tracking and that they want a refund. It's only been 4 days since the order was shipped and today is a holiday. Do y'all think I should just refund them and take the loss or tell them to wait until the estimated delivery day? I know this is a part of the online seller game and I'm not too distraught about the money cause I'm really only $7 into this card, but I'd like some other opinions on the situation EDIT: I should have said I'm a seller with ~5k sale and I've sent hundreds of orders this size, this way. People almost always get their order and this is the first time someone has overtly tried to scam me like this. I'm going to make them wait and then escalate to TCGplayer before I refund. For the people who are saying I should track everything that's over $20, this business would not be sustainable and no one would sell a large volume of cards on TCGplayer if this was enforced. Thanks for the input everyone!",

    "text": "PSA Vault Withdrawal Experience: Consumer Beware I like the general concept of the PSA Vault. Recently I had a few cards that have been in the vault for about 6 months that I wanted to withdraw as gifts for Christmas—I didn’t think it would be a big issue. However after waiting over 2 business weeks for them to ship my cards I received no confirmation. When I reached out the representative said: *We're currently working through a high volume of collectibles, and most orders are shipping within 14-16 business days of the request. However, this is only an estimate, so it's possible it could be slightly sooner or longer.* I asked for the withdrawal to be canceled (they never even left my vault) and they said yes. When I asked for a refund for the withdraw fee and shipping they said they are both non-refundable. I can kind of understand the withdrawal fee being non-refundable but the shipping fee when the item was never shipped should be refunded. I asked to speak to their supervisor and was stone walled—at that point I’m pretty sure I was talking to AI. (Funny how they hire AI customer support but not AI grading). If a bank or brokerage firm did not allow me to withdraw my funds in a timely manner they would be defunct. PSA Vault not having their logistics together enough to simply ship stored items is insane and really diminishes the product as a whole. I’m very disappointed in the withdrawal feature of PSA Vault and seriously makes me reconsider using them as my default shipping location going forward. I just wanted to let you all know this experience in case you were wondering what the withdrawal service was like. **TLDR: PSA Vault has a terrible withdrawal service and I don’t recommend anyone relying on it.**",

    "text": "Ebay - PSA Vault Auctions - 60 Minute Auto-pay? On eBay I place bids on PSA auctions ending that day. I typically win a few and have been paying for everything at once in the evening before bed. Recently, however, it seems that the PSA Store on eBay has a 60-minute auto-pay enabled. Auto-pay itself is fine, but I need all of the cards I purchase to remain in the PSA Vault. The issue is that auto-pay defaults to shipping the cards to my home. Most of the time I catch it in time and change the option, but sometimes I’m busy in the evening and miss the window before auto-pay triggers, preventing me from selecting the vault option. Does anyone know how to turn off the 60-minute auto-pay? Or have the default shipping option go to my vault? I’ve gone through all of my eBay settings and can’t find anything related to this. I’ve also messaged PSA through eBay and contacted eBay support, but so far I’ve only received generic responses with no clear answer. Thanks!",

At this price point, I do expect the product to arrive intact or that remedies for damaged items should not be contingent on placing another purchase.

    "text": "„Sicher bezahlen“ durchgespielt: Wie ich 90€ verlor, weil ich Arbeitsspeicher eingebaut habe Hallo zusammen! Ich möchte euch eine „lustige“ Geschichte erzählen und das absurde Theater schildern, das sich hinter den Kulissen der „Sicher bezahlen“-Funktion – konkret dem **Kleinanzeigen-Käuferschutz (OPP)** – abspielt. # Der Kauf: Ein solider Deal Alles fing am 19. November an. Ich suchte Arbeitsspeicher und fand ein G.Skill Trident Z Neo Kit (3600MHz, 32GB) für 90€. Der Preis war eigentlich Durchschnitt, auch wenn sie auf eBay zu der Zeit schon für 110€ und mehr weggingen. Aus reiner Gewohnheit dachte ich mir einfach: „Fragst mal an, ob er auch 80€ macht.“ Zu meiner Überraschung kam noch am selben Tag ein „Hallo, alles klar“ und das Angebot wurde akzeptiert. Ich zahlte also 90,29€ (inkl. Versand und der Gebühr für „Sicher bezahlen“) – im vollen Vertrauen auf die Funktion. Ohne Hintergedanken. Alles safe, dachte ich. Einziges Warnsignal (im Nachhinein): \"Konstantin\" ließ sich ordentlich Zeit mit dem Versand. Aber gut, kann ja mal passieren. # Der erste Eindruck: Wie Weihnachten Am 25.11. kam das Paket endlich an. Und ehrlich: Der erste Eindruck war top. Die Originalverpackung sah super aus, die Riegel wirkten optisch wie neu, keine Kratzer, nichts. Ich baue sie ein, schalte den PC an – und zack: RGB-Party. Die Dinger leuchteten wie ein Weihnachtsbaum. Sah im Gehäuse einfach nur schick aus. Ich war mit dem Kauf zu 100% zufrieden. # Das böse Erwachen Doch die Freude hielt genau bis zum ersten Test. Ich habe im BIOS das DOCP-Profil (3600 MHz) geladen, aber das Kit läuft damit schlichtweg nicht stabil. Also Memtest an – und da war es: Ein riesiges, rotes „FAIL“ quer über den Bildschirm. Am Ende waren es 13 Fehler. Nur mit dem langsameren JEDEC-Standardprofil (2133 MHz) läuft es. Leider bringt schöne Optik nichts, wenn die Technik Schrott ist. # Der „ehrliche“ Verkäufer Also Verkäufer angeschrieben. Und jetzt wird es interessant. Er gibt im Chat trocken zu: >„Zur Informatio",

    "text": "Tried to Vault a card, but it was stolen Long story short, I bought a card back in July from GameStop. I then went to a card show in the Bay Area where PSA was having a drop off event. I vaulted around 400 slabs and went on with my life. Fast forward to today, I have Collectors emailing me saying that one of the cards was stolen so they can’t vault it. I show them the receipts, the dates, the invoice that connects to the certification proving that I paid for the card back in July, not knowing that it was a stolen card. Their response is in my photo. It actually makes me wonder if there’s a scam going on somewhere where people are selling their cards to GameStop and then saying it was stolen to pretty much get paid twice. I told the guy from Collectors when you go to trade in or sell something at GameStop they scan your ID and fingerprint you - at least in California. So ostensibly it should be pretty simple to find out who sold it at GameStop. Anyway, I’m not going to pay for the card twice, so at least they’ll ship it to me still.",

    "text": "My contribution to the TAG vs. PSA arguments Been seeing a lot of arguments regarding TAG vs PSA and it always comes around to AI, and how TAG is better because it uses AI. Then come the comments about how it’s not AI, and how garbage it is. Then come the comments about how people sent in PSA 8’s and got PSA 10’s. The list goes on and on. Well here’s my take. TAG: PROS- Unique. Machine learning may be the future of grading and they have built an esthetically pleasing slab, and concept in regard to the 1000 point scale. They want to provide collectors with a new way to collect and they are actively gathering reviews, listen, and working hard to make it better. Turnaround times are short. You pay based on the raw value of the card, and not the post grade value. They value transparency. CONS- Everyone thinks TAG is special because of their “MACHINE LEARNING.” It is NOT artificial intelligence, it is building a massive database of what a 10 is and a what a 9 is. That changes, with every single card scanned. By definition, it isn’t consistent when looking at it over a long period of time. Their slabs are cheap, and break with mild thumb pressure to the center of the slab. They have no vaulting service, and lack the ecosystem to properly track values. Grading is expensive for lower value cards. PSA: PROS- Amazing resell value and massive share of the industry, they ARE and likely will remain the industry standard, regardless of all the haters. Even despite the massive issues regarding the 9s being re-graded into 10s after the customer already accepted the grade 9 payout offers, PSA prices held and there was no noticeable reduction in values. The slabs are durable, yet light. Vaulting service allows seamless selling direct to PSA, or direct to EBAY. Selling from the vault means the buyer on eBay doesn’t pay taxes or shipping (if they send to their vault) and in my experience, this means a better sale price. Better payout percentages through eBay for higher value cards. Gra",

    "text": "eBay authentication issue I recently purchased an Omega watch on eBay with the Authenticity Guarantee. The listing explicitly included multiple (3) strap options and an OEM stainless bracelet, which was one of the main reasons I bought this specific watch at the price I paid. The watch just went through authenticity this morning. eBay confirmed that the watch itself is authentic, but flagged a “listing accuracy issue” and stated that the additional strap and bracelet couldn’t be verified and would not be included in the shipment. They gave me the option to accept it without the additional strap and bracelet, or receive a full refund. The problem is that if I want to accept it and just buy a replacement bracelet and strap, just based on a quick search, looks like it’ll be $600-700. So by accepting it, I’m basically overpaying for just the watch head and one strap. Has anyone else had eBay authentication remove things that were clearly shown and described in the listing? Did you accept the item, return it, or get a price adjustment? This is my first time buying from eBay so I’d appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance",

    "text": "Just pulled a Red Manga Rare Luffy I’ve been collecting a bit on and off since the tcg started, but I went into a shop the other day and picked up 3 packs only to see this! I had no idea this rarity even existed and was initially disappointed it wasn’t the normal manga rare until I saw the price. How should I proceed from here? The back is 55:45 but everything else is as mint as it gets. I’d like to sell the card to try and get as much as possible. I’m based in Ireland which makes submitting for grading a bit more difficult than usual, and I’m hesitant to have this card be in the postal system. Is there much of a price difference between PSA and Beckett for One Piece? I think it would probably cost over €500 for me to grade it with PSA, whereas I can pay the more expensive Beckett tier for sub €200. I am considering grading and then selling through somewhere like Fanatics. Any advice on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated!",

    "text": "After going deeper on Chrome NBA to see whether haywire sealed pricing and rare hit distribution actually had some correlation, a few people asked if the same approach could be applied to Chrome Update. I thought that was a fair question. Unlike Chrome NBA, Chrome Update does not have the cheat-code Hanger format. It also lacks a single format that has caught fire the way Breaker’s Delight did on the NBA side. That makes this exercise useful in a different way. It helps answer whether the big hits are concentrated in hobby formats, whether Value Boxes and Megas are truly as barren as they feel, or whether there is any sneaky value play that avoids paying up for hobby. **The questions this research tries to answer:** Which formats offer the best rare hit potential across hobby and retail? How many boxes of each format does it take to pull a rare hit? Are Breaker’s Delight boxes actually as loaded as they appear? Is there any realistic value in $40 Value Boxes or $70 Megas? **What qualifies as a “rare hit” here?** 1) **Parallels, autos, or inserts numbered /50 or less, including:** Gold, White, Orange, Black and Red base parallels, autos, and insert parallels, FrozenFractors, Superfractors, Printing Plates, Cupfractors Gold or better, Image Variations Gold or better, Radiating Rookie Autos, Dual and Triple Autos, Legend Autos, Cupfractor Autos, ASG Image Variations Gold or better, and Larry David Autos. 2) **Case hit or tougher inserts, including:** Radiating Rookies, Chrome Home Field Advantage, Helix, Major League Minis, Alter Egos, Exposé, Celebración, Mickey and Friends, and MLB Debut Patches. One important reminder: I can identify frequencies, not name distribution. Odds do not tell us which players land in which formats. We have to assume reasonably even distribution. If 90% of Nick Kurtz Gold autos are seeded into one format, the only way to know is by watching rips. **Enhanced Hit Frequencies** How many **Hobby** Boxes to pull: ≤50 parallel: 2.3 boxes Case hit",

    "text": "eBay Buyer Didn't Use My Insured Return Label An eBay buyer (who has been a **GIANT PAIN**) opened an (false) INAD return, and I provided an insured label for $425. A few weeks later, they opened a case, and eBay issued another label on my behalf (that they're charging me for). The original label was still good, however I suspect she wanted a QR code instead, because she apparently shipped it from a self-serve kiosk. The potential problem is, this other label is presumably only insured for $100. Based on what I understand, if the returned item gets lost or damaged in shipping, eBay generally forces the seller to refund anyway. Is there anything I can or should do? I suppose this is a little hypothetical considering the item hasn't been lost/damaged yet, however I do feel I should be able to insure my returns if I want to. edit: Bonus message history. https://preview.redd.it/ceacx9x91p9g1.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=27c116f488610236c7d1ec7efcfaffc0d0798e2c https://preview.redd.it/6wkd0bx91p9g1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=f863d84a3f95e7c4f28f5edcb3dc0b418637b326 https://preview.redd.it/2wclxbx91p9g1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=10411673dbc310f1569d65a59f0e8e6169bbd47e https://preview.redd.it/iitnrax91p9g1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc99d5848582c6ec07d7b112a825b8672dac53b6",

    "text": "I often point out that the “Hit Frequency by Format” numbers I post (parallels per box, cards per box, etc.) are cumulative averages across all boxes within a format. The more I’ve watched this product get ripped, the more it feels like certain formats, especially Breaker’s Delight, are disproportionately landing bigger hits. We’ve seen some truly absurd cases (looking at you u/blezsportscards). That got me wondering whether the numbers themselves could help validate or challenge that perception across both hobby and retail SKUs. **How I approached this:** Instead of focusing on per-box averages, I asked a different question: How many boxes of each format does it take to pull a “rare hit”? I looked at two buckets: 1) **Low-numbered parallels (≤50 copies)** This includes Gold, Orange, Black, Red, Super, and Frozenfractor parallels, along with those same parallels of Basketballs, Pulsars, Raywaves, and Geometrics. I also included Image Variation and Auto parallels numbered /50 or less. I understand there are meaningful hits numbered higher than 50 (ex: Flagg Blue Auto /150, Flagg Green Image Variation /99), but those apply to only a handful of players and don’t materially change format-level dynamics. 2) **Case Hit or tougher inserts** These include Rock Stars, Let’s Go!, Ultra Violet, Radiating Rookies, Helix, Lightboard Logos, Hidden Gems, Advisory, Glass Canvas, Paradox, Patented, Fanatical, Finals, and Gold Logomen. Using published odds, I can calculate the frequencies of low-numbered parallels and Case Hits without much trouble. What I cannot account for is name distribution. Odds don’t tell us which players land in which formats. If 90% of Gold Cooper Flagg autos are seeded into Jumbos, I can't help you there. The only way to know that is by watching rips. **Quick side note:** Some base Geometric insert and auto parallels are insanely rare. If the published odds are accurate (which I assume is the case because they are consistent), base Geometric parallels of co",

I’ve heard that PSA charges about $20 but then there’s another fee on top of that? If I wanted to get a card graded, that was a manga versus a promo and they came back at 10 what is the average difference in cost?

The lot of about 60 items sold for $400 plus, but the winner only wants a single item from it for $30. I told him I will not separate it, and he is now asking me to cancel the auction. I already know I will need to block this dude and relist it. If he asked me ahead of time I would have done it smh. My only question is should I make the buyer request to cancel?",

It was long thought that this never went into full production and the only existing example was on display in Nintendo’s corporate office in Redmond Washington. The seller here is a well known whale in the collecting community (meaning when it comes to acquiring items, money usually isn’t an object), and given its relatively low price compared to its rarity and reputation, my guess is he probably found a case or cases of them and has multiple available, and he’s slow dripping them on the market for maximum value. I’m sure more information is to come on this, but this is a pretty wild find.",

We didn't have special storage cases for those slabs, just binders or those trusty shoe boxes for our cards. There wasn't Ebay or other apps to look for comps, there was Beckett or Baseball Card magazine. Wax Boxes were just boxes...not blasters, blisters, or hobby boxes. There were no parallels, short prints, 1/1....just All Star Cards or team cards. A rookie or all star had maybe five cards each year from each brand, not 100 different cards or variations. Set building was a thing back then. There were no influencers or breakers, just the local card shop or the neighbor kid down the street. Card shows were at the mall or your local sporting goods store and players used to sign there for free. Collecting was simple back then. Now the hobby seems like it gambling and the \"House\" (Fanatics) only wins.",

    "text": "Why has eBay completely opted out of the personalised products economy? I want to start a **serious discussion**, not a rant. Personalised products (custom prints, image uploads, engraved items, made-to-order goods) are now a **huge part of ecommerce**. Etsy, Shopify stores, Amazon Custom, and DTC brands are all leaning heavily into it. But eBay seems to have **completely opted out**. Not just “poorly implemented” structurally opted out. On eBay today: * No buyer image/file upload at checkout * No embedded product designers * No design APIs * No way to pause handling time while waiting for buyer details * Sellers get punished for late dispatch even when buyers delay sending info This makes selling personalised items at scale **operationally unsafe**. You end up: * Chasing buyers for details * Receiving info late * Missing dispatch deadlines * Taking account hits for things outside your control What I don’t understand is **why**. This is not a huge technical problem. At eBay’s scale, basic file uploads + handling-time logic would be trivial to implement. The personalised products market is worth **billions per year**, yet eBay seems happy to ignore it entirely. So my questions to other sellers: * Do you think eBay is intentionally avoiding personalisation? * Is it a risk/dispute issue? * Is it about keeping listings interchangeable and price-comparable? * Or is eBay simply choosing not to modernise this part of commerce? I’m genuinely curious how others see this especially sellers who tried personalised products and gave up.",

    "text": "Topps Cosmic Chrome is my absolute favorite product in the Topps baseball line. (To each their own, I know). I bought three cases in 2022. Then in 2023 it jumped from $185 a box north of $275. I only got one case. Then last year it was $350 a box. I just bought two individual boxes. Fast forward to 2025 and we’re now at $549 a box. Up 295% from its release pricing just three years ago. For the first time, I won’t be buying any boxes at all. Michael Rubin and Fanatics are a cancer on this hobby. They’ve gone full heel turn and taken on the villain role; and he doesn’t even pretend to give a shit. He’s catering exclusively to breakers. He’s basically told me; and all the other average everyday buyers of wax, that we’re no longer needed. Please. I’m asking you. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. STOP BUYING INTO BREAKS. STOP PAYING THE INSANE PRICES THAT FANATICS IS SELLING FOR. If you all keep buying; they’ll keep raising prices higher and higher; with no end in sight. SAVE THE HOBBY. STOP BUYING TOPPS/FANATICS. And before all you “it’s free market economics blah blah” people chime in... no. It’s not. The Hobby has become a casino. It’s gone from an industry who sold to fathers and sons; to one that uses every trick in the book to make you believe you’re one pack away from life changing money. The lights. The noise. The breaker screaming at the top of their lungs. The bullshit “that spot is paid” (when it’s def not). It’s all a psy-op to get you more addicted to the point you can’t stop. The one and ONLY thing that will combat this; is to stop buying. Period.",

Hey everyone 👋 It’s been a while since I last updated about the [PokePulse.io](http://PokePulse.io) ALPHA and figured some of you may be interested in how its progressing! (with mod persmission of course) The main goal’s still the same: the best platform for UK collectors using UK-only sold data for raw, graded, and sealed products. Tracking over 200k+ products now! Stuff that’s been added since my last update: * **AI card scanning** (raw, PSA, and ACE slabs) for instant prices — I’ve been using this myself at card shows as a buyer/vendor and it’s been solid * **Deal calculators** for buy / sell / trade * **Multiple portfolios** so you can split your collection up properly and track all purchases/sales you make * **Market analytics** (compare and trend UK market prices, growth, gem rates, grade pops, potential profit, etc.) * **Custom price alerts** * **Imports from Collectr**, eBay purchases, and CSVs * **CardMarket data** from UK sellers for sealed + raw cards (per condition) * **Vendor inventory tools** — still early, but a few vendors are already running parts of their business on it It's getting closer to beta now, and finally starting to look like the UK-focused market platform I wanted to exist for my own collecting and investing! Still loads more to do, and a big thanks to everyone who already uses it and helps with data and feature feedback ❤️ Happy to answer questions and hear what people want to see next (use invite code ALPHATEST at [https://pokepulse.io](https://pokepulse.io) if you want to give it a whirl) 👍",

    "text": "Current Vault Shipping Experience Recently got a high value card (~12k) graded and originally shipped it to vault to sell on EBay. It took a couple weeks for vault shipping to go through but then I experienced weeks of issues and 2 tickets with PSA where no matter how many times I tried to list on EBay, it would never work. After a month of dealing with that, I decided to ship back to me and I’ll sell myself. And the point of the post is this is the current timeframe you can expect shipping from the vault: 15 Nov: Paid to ship from vault, cost $13 total including under 90 day fee. Status changed to “shipped” but did not receive a tracking number. Nothing for almost a month... 12 Dec: I finally cracked and decided to make another ticket. As I was typing of the ticket I decided to check my email one last time and somehow got the shipping info at that exact moment. 16 Dec: card arrived, signature required. Just awareness for anyone waiting on vault shipping so that you don’t panic when weeks go by without hearing anything.",

    "text": "Don't use BGS Germany I've been grading cards since 2019 with BGS and have hit a 90%+ accuracy rate with my pre grades. Frankly, BGS Germany is like a brand new grading company and their standards do not match the ones set by the USA hub. I have sent twice and both times my cards have graded 1 to 1.5 less then my pre grades. To show their inconsistency I resent a vintage shadowless Pokemon Holo, (originally a PSA 9 new cert, which received a quad BGS 9 grade the first time I sent it in) which centering went from a 9 to a 10 (it was better than a 9, but still - how should the one objective subgrade change so much?). Another example is the pristine shining mew that was a PSA 9 new cert. How did it get a BGS 8.5 (8 surface is crazy, it was flawless)? The card is clearly also OC and I had sent it in assuming it would get a 9 centering grade - but it got a 9.5 which it shouldn't have. The shadowless 9++ Raichu is one of the cleanest Shadowless holos I've owned (I've graded 4 shadowless 9.5 holos, Blastoise and 3 raichus) and frankly deserves the bump. BGS EU didn't think so and was returned to me. I refuse to send more cards to BGS EU until I can see their grading is more aligned with BGS USA as it's just a waste of money at this point and 3 months waiting. All of these OP cards deserved higher graded imo. That being said, I see a lot of opportunity buying BGS 9.5s that were graded in the EU hub and cracking, sending to PSA or resubbed to BGS.",

As I'm sure you know, recently \"investors\" from pokemon have made their way into the community en masse, buying up every card they think people will want and then jacking the prices as high as they can. Now correct me if I'm wrong or happen to be in the minority here, but I think that's lame as hell. I want to make something extremely clear, one piece is a game for the players. WE have the power to keep one piece from becoming a money laundering scheme. Starting from here on, don't buy any alt art, promo or otherwise, for any price higher than what TCGPLAYER says the card was worth on November 20th 2025. Or really any other card that you can tell has obviously been bought out and gouged like op01 luffy base leader. Just buy the cards you need for your decks. Tell your friends, tell your family, tell that weird dude at your locals that no one likes, this has to be a community effort. Scalping is a risky game, something people should've learned when they spent their life savings on Journey Together packs just to find out no one wanted them and especially not for 3x msrp. They will be forced to lower the prices back down if they want to make any sort of money back, as long as we don't buy from these crypto losers, prices *will* go back down. It's economics 101.",

PSA Pros: Most established brand, easier to get a 10. PSA Cons: Reputation damaged due to recent buyback and regrade fiasco; atrocious turnaround times; up-charging on expensive cards that get a 10. Beckett Pros: Higher standards equals higher value on slabs that get a pristine 10; cheaper grading fees; quicker TAT; sub-grades allow for transparency; slabs look better (that's just my opinion). Beckett Cons: the dreaded 9.5 score is very common, and while many 9.5's can cross-grade to PSA 10's, the value isn't the same as a PSA 10.",

Obviously there's eBay, 130pt, fanatics & more, & I also use Sports Cards Pro, but none seem to be able to cite every card printed of any specific player. Is this simply/often down to none being in circulation? Or should/do better, more comprehensive lists exist? Now, maybe I'm bad at searching properly or am overlooking something/where but for the life of me I can't find what I'm after. Does it exist or is it a case of aggregating all info from various places? For my sins I kinda pc Mac Jones and just pick up cards when I fancy it (not too difficult) but my daughter has gone from K-pop to card collecting in the past year & having latched onto the Seattle Storm a few years ago, is now after as many Dominique Malonga cards as WE (I'm funding it) can get (there are TONS). I'm not against it, she's both a good 'prospect' *&* prospect & isn't too expensive atm. She's got spreadsheets & notes everywhere, is in & out of eBay buying, bidding & watching & has got close to 40 cards so far. There are a LOT more (& more coming with Prizm...) out there but not everywhere lists them, even Beckett doesn't have some cards on their various checklists. This is largely the reason for the question tbh.",

He send a message letting me know he was stopping payment and he's done it before, eBay won't be able to stop home. I laughed. Turns out 8 weeks later, he was right, got to keep the item and the money!!! I called eBay 5x, was lied to several times, didn't help, told me that there is nothing I can do, they let the buyer steal 600 bucks. They actually suggested that I hire a lawyer to see if I can get the item or my payment...what!!!!??? I'm done with eBay after 20 years and making them thousands of dollars.",

    "text": "From Ecuador, trying to build tools for collectors — not just another grading label. I’m a long-time collector from Ecuador who somehow ended up running a small grading project. Instead of doing a pure “look at my company” post, I wanted to share what we’re trying to build and ask if this actually makes sense from a collector’s point of view. Context: collecting from Latin America If you live in the US, you send your cards to PSA/BGS/CGC and that’s it. If you live in most of Latin America, it’s a mess: you ship through intermediaries you pay crazy shipping and customs you wait months and you still don’t have any real digital way to manage your collection I’m trying to solve that problem first, and grading is just the entry point. The project is called OGS (Opulence Grading System), based in Ecuador, but the idea is bigger than just slabbing cards. --- The idea: a “collector tools” platform, not a marketplace clone What we’re building inside the user account is basically: 1. Ownership transfer between users If two collectors trade/sell peer-to-peer, they can move the card from one account to another inside the system. No marketplace, no listing fees – just a record of who currently owns it. 2. Ability to “release” a card If you sell a card outside the platform (show, Instagram, eBay, whatever), you can release it so the next owner can claim it. That way there aren’t 5 people saying “that card is mine” years later. 3. A real collection manager Front/back images, serial, grade details, ownership status – all in one place. Nothing fancy visually yet, but functional. 4. Things we want to add if the base works direct send-to-auction for some houses AI-assisted pre-grading digital vaulting population reports an optional “trust”/reputation layer for peer-to-peer deals optional public profiles for people who actually want visibility This is not meant to replace eBay or MySlabs or anything like that. The goal is simply to give people in this region tools we never had.",

    "text": "19 years later the rainbow is complete When I was a teenager I was really big into baseball prospects (2005-2009). Got away from the hobby for about 15 years and got back into it 2 years ago at 32 years old when I found a couple boxes of my cards at my parents place. Nostalgia instantly kicked in and I started hunting for some of those players I collected as a teen and have been picking up some of their Bowman Sterling and Bowman Chrome prospect cards. At the time, my lawn mowing money pretty much limited me to base autos and refractors. Tyler Colvin was one of those players I collected. I had his Sterling base and refractor autos, ungraded. Upgraded those to BGS 9.5s. Found the BGS 9.5 black refractor about a year and a half ago. I was pretty content having those 3 and figured I'd never find the red refractor 1/1. Even the black refractors /25 are pretty tough to find from 2006. Last week I was adding some cards to my ebay store and decided to do a quick search for 2006 Colvin Sterling and BAM - the red 1/1 BGS 9.5 was staring back at me. The last time this card sold publicly was 2012! Couldn't believe it!",

    "text": "2025 Topps Cosmic Chrome Analysis & Print Runs Topps decided to keep the surprises coming today, quietly releasing the odds for 2025 Cosmic Chrome. This product has built a strong following over the years, and it would be great to see it get the attention it deserves. Unfortunately, these odds will almost certainly be overshadowed by the upcoming major Chrome releases- but there’s still plenty here worth breaking down. **Initial Observations: The Lunar Box Problem** As much as I’d like to offer a complete and definitive analysis, Topps left out a few critical details that prevent that for now. Cosmic Chrome has historically been a hobby-only product, but this year introduces a second SKU: Lunar Boxes. The issue? We have no confirmed information on the core box dynamics- price, cards per pack, packs per box, or case configuration. We do have odds, and what’s clear is that Lunar Boxes were produced in very small quantities. Based solely on the odds, nothing appears exclusive to Lunar Boxes that isn’t also in Hobby. However, Checklist Insider notes exclusive Lunar Eclipse parallels, but these do not appear anywhere on Topps’ own odds sheet. Lunar Boxes contain zero autos, and they also exclude a handful of rare insert superfractors and red refractors found in Hobby. At the same time, several rare inserts and parallels have better odds in Lunar Boxes than in Hobby, which is unusual given the lack of autos. For now, Lunars remain a conundrum: likely a lower-cost or “Hobby Lite” configuration of some kind, but impossible to evaluate properly without basic product info. Once those details are available, I’ll compare value metrics between formats. For now, the analysis below focuses strictly on Hobby. **EDIT: Some new information has come to light regarding Lunar Boxes.** **Just like 2024, Topps slipped ultra-elusive Lunar Boxes into Cosmic Chrome. Last year we had 100. For 2025, we get 147 of them, with each pack containing a Lunar Eclipse /10 parallel.** **It threw me for",

I did reach out to PSA support so I’ll see what they say, just wondered if anyone else knew what the reason might be. It’s not a super valuable card, but not having it in a slab really removes any ability I have to sell/trade it as a graded card. Thanks Reddit!

Whenever someone asks, “How do you ship a sports card valued over $20?” If it’s a card valued over $19.99 or in a slab (or even 1-3 cards in this range), this is how I ship them for maximum protection: 1. Put the card and a Dad Man's Dugout sticker in a team bag. 2. Secure the card between 2 pieces of cardboard for extra stability. 3. Wrap it all with a rubber band to hold everything in place. 4. Include my handwritten thank-you note: I thank the customer for their purchase, ask them to follow my eBay store, Whatnot account, and social media. I also provide 1 or 2 fun facts about the player and ask for their feedback. 5. Place it in a bubble mailer, then nest that inside another bubble mailer for double protection. 6. Add a \"Fragile: Handle with Care\" sticker on the outside. For cards valued under $20, I keep it simpler with a team bag, folded paper case, and painter's tape inside a thank-you card (check my other video for details!). I'll upload more videos soon!

Klarna has been giving me an ID Verification error on any purchase I try to make in the app. So I thought if I just put $200 into my Klarna balance I should be able to spend that with no problem in the app. I was wrong. I added the card to my Apple Wallet and tried to pay that way (for a PAY NOW purcase in the Klarna app for an ebay gift card) and it says \"We cannot process your card.\" So I tried using the actual Klarna debit card # for the purcahse and I get the same error. I don't see a way to choose KLARNA BALANCE at checkout. But I show a $200 balance in my account. So now I don't have the $200 in my bank account anymore AND Klarna won't let me spend it. What is going on?! How can I buy a freaking gift card in their app?!? I have been on chat hold for almost 24 hours waiting for a supervisor about the ongoing ID Verification problem. But that shoudn't matter for spending the $ that is in my Klarna balance? Right????",

    "text": "End of 2025 \"Where to find cards\" Buying Guide **TLDR:** There are no easy ways to get Pokemon cards without spending a lot per pack, sorry. But since a lot of people keep posting and asking, this'll break down what else you can try. **Why cant I find cards:** \\-2025 Popularity Surge and Price Bubble - Starting late 2024 Pokemon card popularity began to once again surge, with the surge came scarcity as product was unable to be fulfilled to meet demand. This unprecedented demand was met with surging prices as well beginning a ridiculous value increase spiral that has caught the eyes of not just the general public but also big money investors. The more money that gets focused into the hobby, the more people start to hear about it, and unfortunately the more people try finding opportunity to make money from others in the hobby. \\-Scalpers - These are the people who follow around card vendors, buy everything they can so that others cant get it, then flip it for 2x or 3x price. If you are dedicated and thorough you can make some serious money doing this BUT IT IS HIGHLY RISKY. One bad buy could tie up thousands and waste your time trying to sell. \\-Cardshops - In response to the popularity and scalpers, many shops have taken to raising prices themselves to take in as much profit while the market is hot. Some may be scalpers themselves hitting up stores to stock their own store, or they can be in cahoots with scalpers buying at just under market price to resell above market price since its still tough to find cards. Its a two way street that never benefits the general buyer. \\-Grading - You pay a company (hopefully reputable) to assess the condition of your card. This is usually done for 2 of the many reasons, protection or resale. Since factories are pumping cards out in a mad rush, quality control is terrible. If a card is assessed at Gem Mint condition (usually listed as a 10) then it is likely in the top percentage of condition for that card, this gives it a massive p",

    "text": "Shipper being billed the recipients import duties/taxes/fees 2 months after delivery is completed? I sell on eBay and I've been shipping internationally with Fedex for years and I've never had this happen before. Before anyone asks I'm not based in the US so unfortunately can't use eBays GSP for international orders, I would if I could. A Fedex shipment to the UK was delivered 3 months ago. I always monitor my international shipments and along the shipping journey it showed the normal International shipment release - Import, which has always previously meant the recipient has paid any duties/taxes/fees which were due, the shipment was then delivered and that was the end of that. I paid the invoice for the shipping when Fedex invoiced me a short while after that. Now 3 months later I received a $110 invoice for the duties/taxes/fees that were due for the shipment. I queried the invoice and the billing department says payment for the duties/taxes/fees was not received within 90 days from the recipient so the shipper is now liable for the charges. But if that was the case how was the shipment even released for import, I have had shipments previously where the recipient has initially refused to pay the duties/taxes/fees and the shipment does not move until they are settled. In those cases I at least have some leverage at that point because my shipments are from eBay sales, if the recipient fails to pay the duties/taxes/fees they forfeit the entire order with no refund and the goods are returned to sender. Once that realisation hits home the recipients have always paid the duties/taxes/fees owing and the shipment is then delivered. But in this case with the item having already been delivered and it now being 3 months down the line I'm right up sht creek with no paddle in that regard. Does anyone have any idea what has transpired here? EDIT : The actually delivery date was over 3 months ago, I was going off of the invoice date which was issued at a later date. I have upda",

I won an auction for a PSA 10 slab directly from the PSA Vault. The auction ended on Nov. 30 and “tracking” was added Dec. 3. “Tracking” because they gave me a number on the order details but in the actual tracking details it just shows pre-shipment status. Does it usually take this long to ship from the vault or is something off here and I should reach out to them? Thanks in advance if you have any experience to share.",

    "text": "How I ship a trading card valued $20 or under When someone asks, \"How do you ship a sports card valued under $20?\"If it's just 1-3 cards valued under $20, this is how I ship them: 1. Put the card and a Dad Man's Dugout sticker in a team bag. 2. Take a half sheet of paper and fold it to create a protective case around the team bag. 3. Tape the card inside a thank-you card using painter's tape. 4. In the thank-you card, thank the customer for their purchase, ask them to follow my eBay store, Whatnot account, and social media. I also provide 1 or 2 fun facts about the player and ask for their feedback. If it's a card valued over $19.99 or in a slab, I send it a little differently—I use cardboard for extra protection extremely secure. I’ll upload more videos soon!

    "text": "PSA 10 Sealed Pack Collection Ruined # Hey everyone, Never thought I'd be nervous posting something on the internet but here it goes! I’ve been collecting 1st Edition WOTC Pokémon booster packs (preferably unweighed) in PSA 10s, all artworks, building a uniform, sealed pack collection. Now I know most will think that I'm a moron based on most posts i've seen around here regarding sealed packs but I don't care. I have a vision in mind and I'm planning on framing them all onto my wall with the corresponding sets of cards under it which will make a great piece for my office space. It has taken many may hours, quite a bit of money, lots of driving around and years of networking with other collectors across Europe to make it possible. Recently as I was getting close to being finished collecting all packs I decided to have some of my older PSA-slabbed packs *re-holdered* into the new PSA holders to make the whole set match in display. Now I know this is Reddit and I'm not an idiot, I did my research before but hadn't found any record of people attempting this due to the way old slabs had the packs pushed into them. So before sending them in, I explicitly instructed PSA that if reholdering would require opening the slabs and risk regrading, they should *not* open them and simply return them in their original PSA 10 holders. Unfortunately, after 10 months of waiting I got a mail stating that PSA **ignored that instruction** entirely. They opened the slabs anyway, regraded the packs, and returned them to me as PSA 7s, 8s and 9s. Not a single PSA 10 remains of the old slabs. Even if the old slabs weren’t perfect, they were still PSA 10s, I could have kept them as-is, or even traded them with old-label collectors in exchange for new slabs. Obviously my heart sank when I received their apology email because they realised they made a mistake. I'm absolutely gutted to realise that a collection that took so much of me to collect is now just a mix of random packs worth basically no",

I messaged the seller to tell him that didn’t look like a 58 but definitely looked like a 54. You can even see the reference in one of the pics. He wrote back and said he bought it from an eBay seller a few weeks prior and sent a picture of the listing which has a heritage reference number and says it is 39mm. This watch made it through the “Authentication” process and was delivered. There is no way they looked at this watch because at the very least the reference number in the listing was not 79000.

    "text": "eBay refunds on card purchases... I’m selling cards on eBay and in the last few weeks I’ve had to refund card buyers their money because they claim they did not receive the card. Whether or not they actually did receive it, I do not know because USPS isn’t consistent on scanning and updating the tracking if shipped via eBay envelope (value under $20). In these instances is there any way to not be forced by eBay to refund the purchaser since I did ship it based on eBay’s tracking? Moving forward do I just need to increase my shipping costs so there is a USPS tracking label on every purchase no matter the cost for the card itself? Meaning the shipping would then be about $6.",

    "text": "I’m sure this is a question as old as time, but forgive my ignorance. As a collector who has been in the hobby for a year, I have learned quite a bit, but I still have much more learning to do. I’m sure the question above will help others like me who are slowly getting into the hobby. I have a local card shop in my area that has very reasonable prices for the sports that I collect, which is football (soccer), European basketball, and baseball. They do an amazing job of getting any hobby box that I request if they are able. This year I have been able to pick up topps finest, multiple topps chrome products, and really any baseball product I would like. I typically prefer to buy hobby boxes over blasters/retail and I am slowly getting into buying singles on EBay and at local card shows. I really enjoy being a wax ripping degenerate and I even protect a lot of my base cards even though I know boxes are -EV long term. There is one thing I have noticed, sometimes my LCS prices hobby boxes higher than what I can find online from retailers like Dave and Adam’s and Blowout Cards. For example, I want a box of 2024-25 Topps Chrome UEFA Club Competitions Soccer Hobby Box. My LCS is selling it for $225. Wax Stat has the average box price $239.95, and then there is another site that I saw a box for $200. Let me say this, I know that shops are really able to price their products however the hell they want and they probably get products at MSRP. My LCS is not budging on his price with me and I fear his 15 boxes will sit on the shelf for a long time. As a consumer, I’m a little bit of a penny pincher and I want to make sure I’m not overpaying for the same product. Is there any tips that long term collector can give me that will save me money long term? Side note, one thing that I have an issue with is breakers buying vast amounts of product which then inadvertently drives the price up. I have been able to get a box of Topps premier league for around $150 and snag two boxes, that pro",

The only issue is that I move back to the Netherlands on January 23rd. The time listed on the website for regular and express is both 10 work days, but it also mentions a month long backlog. In other words, the timing will be very tight. Realistically, what are my chances for getting my graded card in time? Does anybody have experience with PSA Japan? On the other hand, if it doesn’t work out, I am planning on having it shipped to the Netherlands instead (which I believe is possible). The issue I am now facing is whether or not I would have to pay 21% VAT over the speculative value of the card, even though I am not buying it for that price but rather having my own card shipped to me. That would be a very heavy hit in combination with the PSA grading price itself. Ps: I have added some ugly photos of the card in case anyone would like to see it. I apologize for the flash, the lighting in my apartment is awful.",

Black Friday Value Boxes are now confirmed at $35, and Costco Super Boxes at $45 online (some buyers have shown pricing of $40 in their local store, but my calculations will assume the $45 MSRP). **Best $ per card** 1) Fat pack — 19 cents 2) Costco Super Box — 21 cents 3) Hanger boxes &amp; Mega boxes — 22 cents **Worst $ per card** 10) Jumbo- $1.04 9) Hobby- 85 cents 8) Value Box- 30 cents **Best $ per parallel** 1) Fanatics Value Box — $2.47 2) Costco Super Box — $2.97 3) Value Box — $5.83 4) Black Friday Target Value Box — $5.93 **Worst $ per parallel** 10) Hobby — $37.27 9) Jumbo — $27.59 8) Fat Pack — $13.21 **Best $ per auto** 1) Costco Super Box — $291.60 2) Hobby — $394.23 3) Jumbo — $419.19 (This is one of the rare times ho",

    "text": "Mailman accidently marked 30 packages as delivered when doing a pickup. 10 INR cases opened. USPS denied insurance, eBay won't cover me because no proof of delivery. I had a package pickup of 30 packages at my house. My mailman accidently marked them all as delivered instead of picked up. She said it was an accident as she was delivering a package in a rush and didn't change the screen. Almost immediately I had 30 messages from buyers accusing me of cheating them. Even after explaining to the buyers that everything was ok they would still get the package and it was just a mistake 10 people immediately opened up INR cases. I do have a pretty large account, but i'm still worried about what 10 INR cases in 1 day will do to my metrics. The tracking says delivered to my house and while the items still got delivered to the buyers there were no updates on the public website after the mistaken delivery scan. USPS told me that is by design to not update after delivery, but their internal system shows all updates. I got the internal tracking report printed out from my post office for all 10 INR cases from USPS that shows delivery to the buyers and eBay denied it saying they only accept online tracking from the carriers website. USPS denied the insurance claim because the internal tracking shows delivered. Of the 10 cases open, 3 were closed by the buyers when they got the item but the other 7 cases are still open and the buyers are not responding to any of my messages. They were pretty instant to complain and open a case, but now that it's delivered they are nowhere to be found. No one has escalated the case yet but I will instantly lose the money and get defects if they do. Has this happened to anyone before or any other advice? I have called eBay many times about it and they say the tracking is not valid and my report is not valid. They said I could maybe appeal once eBay refunds the buyer but that is my only option and there is no guarantee.",

    "text": "PSA Grading in Canada or US? Hey everybody! I just dropped off my cards in-person at the PSA Canada location in Mississauga yesterday for the first time. First off I thought it would be some hugeee space with a fancy reception area and a PSA grading sweatshop in the back. It was not. Instead it was just 2 really cool guys chilling that helped me out. Felt like I just entered a LCS. The space was small I mean real small like the size of a standard public washroom. From what I have seen online the grading process does NOT take place in Canada instead PSA Canada still operates as a middle man and sends it off to the US. I could not find some definitive information on this they imply it but don’t openly say “hey guys the grading process still takes place in the US.” Honestly huge bummer because the middle men I was using before was A. Cheaper ($32 per card with them) and ($40 per card with PSA) B. The other guys I was using didn’t even charge me for shipping to begin with. And C. If PSA grades in the USA the turnaround time should be about the same. (It took 73 days with the other guys... PSA tbd) Ultimately my question is this. Does anyone know if I’m wrong and the grading process does indeed take place in Canada? Thanks!!",

    "text": "I designed and 3D printed a Steam Deck powered Arcade Machine (as well as my own \"Steam Machine\") I took on a fun little DIY project this year of creating a 3D-Printed arcade machine for my home office and what better device to use for it then my Steam Deck. This is actually the second version, the first was missing a volume dial and had some redundant holes for screws. As well as this I found a Steam Deck OLED motherboard on eBay for a good price and designed my own \"Steam Machine\", although I wanted this one to be able to hook onto my belt or pocket so that I can use them with a Bluetooth controller and my AR glasses. It's a bunch of fun and a very silly idea that was a blast to design and make. This also meant I had a dedicated machine for the arcade that I could slot in and out using a little basket. If anyone is interested in the STL files or a longer explanation of how I did it, let me know and I can post them online. Go easy on me as well, I'm very new to this!

    "text": "Sellers really need to stop using the AI description Edit: This post is specifically talking about eBay's built-in \"AI\" description tool, not actual AI tools that actually work. I can't tell you how many times its happened. I find a listing I'm interested in, go to the description, and its just \"This item is a quintessential addition to your collection. With a plastic construction and durable metal details, its sure to last. It is manufactured by this company, a well-known brand in this hobby. If features a green color and is suitable for ages 14 and up. This ready-to-play item is 1:45 scale and sure to capture your imagination in miniature form.\" I mean, honestly, can't people see how awful and fake that sounds? The description is there to tell buyers more about the item and help them see if its a good idea to buy it. What I don't want from an eBay description is useless gushing. Added to that, I doubt its even an AI powering it. Most likely, its just a template that fills in the information you give it. Because it all sounds the same. Like, *exactly* the same. I've sold quite a few things on eBay and I've written detailed descriptions for each and every item. Its not that difficult. And you're more likely to make the sale if you put in that effort. I tried the AI description once and I'm glad I read it before listing the item because it told the buyer nothing more than they could clearly see from the title and pictures. Am I the only one who views it this way? So many sellers use it now and its so dumb.",

    "text": "PSA Offer 51% of Card Ladder/PSA Value I see all these posts and social media on buy back through PSA being 80–85-90%. How about 51%? Granted, the 4 prior sales were around $500 but recent sales should be a 2 way street. Context: -2 most recent sales ~770 -Traditionally a 650-800 card -4 consecutive sales between 11/16-11/20 around 500 I’ve had plenty of cards where this scenario is flipped; I go to accept the offer on my Vaulted card, and it’s expired. The new offer is based on the most recent sale and now, 10-30% less. Mostly ranting, but I’m lost as how these buy back offers are calculated.",

    "text": "I’ve been in the hobby for a while and mostly buy singles, but I wanted to try Fanatics Collect’s Instant Rip just to see how everything works. Dropped $250 on a basketball pack just out of curiosity. I actually pulled a legit grail: a 2014 LeBron James patch card. Their system immediately showed a “value” around $1,400, which made no sense at all. Realistic value is maybe $500 to $600. So I skipped their whole end-of-process valuation and took the $1,200 instant credit. That part was easy. Everything after that... not great. The user interface feels like it was designed by someone who doesn’t collect. It’s clunky, the layout is strange, and finding basic info takes more taps than it should. Their weekly auction structure also feels odd. Maybe there’s a reason for it, but from the outside it just seems limiting. Their Card Ladder pricing is rough. They’re pulling comps from 2022, so you basically have to bounce between eBay and their app to figure out real values. It slows everything down and makes it hard to trust what you’re looking at. I used my $1,200 credit toward an overpriced 1980 Topps Bird–Magic–Dr. J rookie PSA 7 listed at $1,600. I paid the extra $400 cash to cover the difference and added it to my collection. Cool. Then I tried to withdraw it. They hit me with a $75 fee. $48 to “withdraw” the card, with no explanation or breakdown. $25 shipping. Plus tax. Paying $75 just to get a card in hand is wild. It makes the whole thing feel like a cash grab built on keeping you inside their ecosystem and charging you every time you try to leave it. At this point I’m deleting the app and won’t be using it again. That’s just my experience, but it was enough for me.",

Value Bulk had a 60 business day wait time, which has been updated to 65. I sent in a submission expecting it to take 12 weeks, or \\~3 months to return and boy was I wrong. I sent in 26 cards the day before I left for college, Sep 2nd. Package arrived on the 5th, and PSA marked it as arrived Sep 9th. I expected these to be complete \\~ Early December. They then did not open my box until October 12th. My package had sat there for 5 weeks, and the 12-week countdown had not even begun. My submission has still not passed grading, and arrived at psa 79 days ago. It is expected to be completed on January 14th, but as we've seen PSA is quite often late and will not hit this deadline. A PSA submission, best-case scenario, will take longer than the entire semester of school. I understand high demand right now, and high wait times. However, claiming 65 business days while the actual expected date is 134 days away, and will likely be missed, is absurd and deceptive. I don't see how they continue to take express submissions for hundreds in grading fees, yet provide no clarity at all on the return speeds of normal submissions.",

The last time I remember purchasing cards in person it was 1996! Having a digital card that is backed by a physical copy which is held in a VAULT...for little old me... My 12 year old self wouldn't believe it! I would've thought you'd have to be some well to do sports memorabilia collector. It's such a nostalgic feeling to collect cards, and now GameStop partnered with PSA to help give us Power Packs! This is such a smart way to bring Trading Cards to the future.

I have a submission processing right now and I noticed something different when I got my grades revealed to me. After my grade reveal was done, PSA offered to buy my cards off me and gave me a 24 hour countdown to sell to them. Before this submission, my last order cleared in August and I got no such offer in the app or anywhere else. I can’t help but think that PSA, the company that grades cards, is intentionally downgrading certain cards with the hope that I’d sell to them, and they’d just regrade for a 10. I’m not a scrub. I did my due diligence of checking all cards and gently cleaning them before sending them out for grading. Boy was I surprised that only 8 out of 39 came back as 10’s. I can’t shake this feeling that there is an obvious incentive for PSA to screw me out of quality cards so they can auction it themselves in eBay. I dunno, maybe I’m overreacting. Am I crazy in thinking this?",

The irony’s melting faster than a Charizard under Fire Spin 🔥📈 So PSA just announced it’s now the official vault for eBay — meaning all those graded slabs, signed cards, and holy grails are now living rent-free in corporate cold storage. Cool move, right? But here’s the kicker: GameStop’s been quietly building its own Power Packs + NFT marketplace, already minting authenticated, serialized digital collectibles with on-chain provenance. eBay’s handing PSA their crown jewels... while GameStop’s setting up the damn vault and the metaverse that displays it. One’s playing 2015 FinTech catch-up. The other’s quietly engineering 2030 digital ownership. They can lock their cards in PSA vaults all they want — but the real vault is the balance sheet: 💰 $9.6B in cash + BTC 💎 A DRS army 🦍 A marketplace ready to tokenize everything This isn’t a collectible bubble — it’s the tokenization of tangible nostalgia. And the irony? Wall Street’s still shorting the only player actually holding the keys. 🚀🦍 “They keep vaulting assets. GameStop keeps vaulting the future.”",

    "text": "How to buy a card over $2500 on eBay when located outside the US? Hi, in the past i’ve bought cards on eBay using EIS as all cards were below the $2500 limit. Now, i’m looking for an Ohtani Auto but they are all over $2500 and no one is willing to sell outside the US. I’ve messaged many sellers without success. I understand the potential problems for the sellers in this case. My preffered shipping method would be DHL insured for full value as i don’t want to skip customs in, i just want the card to arrive safely. :) Card shows are not an option as they are very scarce in the EU and sportscards for US sports are even harder to get (mostly Pokemon and other gaming cards). And other auction sites like Goldin or Heritage just don’t offer a variety of cards like eBay and tend to only offer even more expensive cards. Does anybody have suggestion how to work the problem or how to communicate with a seller to make an exception? I also would like to add that i still would like to use eBay just for safety reasons. Thanks!",

I believe this is fairly new and the FAQ says that it can take several weeks if cards to show up. This all makes me think about the underwear that sold on eBay a few months ago. That felt like the beginning of a new partnership. Think about it, other than GameStop, where else would you go to buy used video games? EBay. A partnership with EBay and PSA with card buying and selling + grading + used video games. This could be part of the digital transformation.",

Not Fanatics. GameStop. You know, the “brick-and-mortar dinosaur” hedge funds swear is supposed to be bankrupt by now. Meanwhile GME is over here building: • a marketplace • a grading pipeline • a distribution loop • and now a multi-sport collectibles ecosystem ...all with PSA smiling and delivering product straight into it like a UPS driver in heat. But yeah, tell me again how “fundamentals don’t support it.” Because the only fundamentals I see are: 💎 PSA partnering deeper 💎 more IP 💎 more categories 💎 more revenue streams 💎 and a collectibles market bigger than some entire sectors of the S&P. We went from “they sell used games” to “they just hijacked the future of graded collectibles.” And the media still hasn’t noticed. Good. Let them sleep. We’ll wake them up later. 🚀🟣",

    "text": "GameStop is stronger than ever, GME is a safe bet I bought my first GME in 2021 during the huge run up and have watched every second of GameStop's turnaround. The stock has gone up and down and is currently at a relative low point. I just want to make some bullet points on why I am bullish as ever, hold more shares than I ever have, and why I'm completely comfortable buying and holding into 2026: - Ryan Cohen and the board have continually bought and held shares. We added a new board member from PSA Nat Turner and hopefully we see his buy soon, he can get in at a nice low price currently - In 2021 GME hit $120 (or more depending on broker) before brokers turned off the buy button. Since then GameStop has went from losing money to making money and having $9 billion in assets. I expect to break that price point - Last earnings shareholders were given a warrant dividend on their shares, strike price of $32. It educated us on derivatives, will make GameStop some more cash as long as GME exceeds $32 by next Halloween, and makes shareholders money if they choose to sell or execute. I would guess that next earnings we could receive another - GameStop moves quietly, they just released a physical videogame for GameBoy and Retromod called Buck and the Cursed Cartridge, game looks fun and inventive. Ryan Cohen is cooking behind the scenes and told us to judge him by his actions not his words. GameStop will post even better earnings this quarter from PowerPacks revenue, PSA grading, and collectibles - Roaring Kitty used to stream talking about console cycles, Nintendo Switch 2 just released and will make GameStop some nice profits from those sales. We have seen the lines outside stores, GameStop is still a hub for gamers - DFV could still update us on a YOLO post since we saw he had 9,001,000 shares last post, but it would be interesting to see his share count including warrants or maybe new calls bought. There is no reason to believe he is not still holding, he tweeted all las",

I had my shipment from the vault held for pickuo at the fedex store and when i arrived, the worker at the counter said the bag that the box was in was opened, and so I said “okay well let me open this in front of you to make sure its actually in there” It was in fact not in there, the box was also opened, and the card removed. It absolutely had to have been a FedEx worker because i had it held for pickup, so no porch bandits today. Gutted really because the card in question was a miscut shadowless charmander without an MC label that I assume PSA only insured for it’s regular price. So likely I will get like $40 and never get to hold the card in person that I was over the moon about. The worst part is, there is absolutely nothing I could have done to prevent this. I have contacted FedEx and PSA and will see what happens. All I know is my day is ruined.",

I am not too familiar with the value of the cards, and I am not familiar with most of the players. I recently found out about PSA Vault, but am still confused on my next steps. I am trying to save time. Should I send the whole collection to PSA Vault and have them take care of everything? Or should I sift through all the cards and sort what I believe to be valuable, then ship those to PSA Vault? And then sell those \"junk\" cards in bulk on eBay? I just want to make sure I am getting the most amount of money from this collection. I looked through the PSA Vault eBay store, and I see that there are some cards of not-so-famous players selling for a $20+ per card. Please go easy on this ignorant fella, just trying to get rid of old items, thank you LOL. Edit: This collection is from 20+ years ago. All raw cards, no graded. Cards from 80s, 90s, and early 2000s.

    "text": "☕ 59 Coffee Break Detective Pikachu Promos - My First Time Grading! Need PSA/Card Grading Tips! 🕵️♂️ I was incredibly lucky and managed to acquire 59 copies of the Coffee Break Detective Pikachu promo card. They are all in pristine condition—they've only been handled twice: once to open and once to immediately put them into storage. I've done some research and see a PSA 10 copy can sell for around the $400 range, which has me excited! I believe a large majority of my copies would grade highly, but I'm completely new to the process and need some guidance before I send them in. ❓ My Grading and Shipping Questions PSA Service Levels: I looked at the PSA website and saw different prices for submission. What is the actual difference in service for a higher price? Is it just the turnaround time (how fast they grade them) and the Max Declared Value for insurance/upcharge purposes? I'm only looking to get the cards graded, so I'm not sure which price tier to choose. Trial Submission: I'm planning on submitting a small batch (2 or 3 cards) first to get a feel for the process and see what grades I get back before sending in the rest. Does this sound like a good strategy? Grading Company (PSA vs. Others): Is PSA still the undisputed \"go-to\" and best value-maximizer for modern Pokémon cards? Are there other companies like CGC or BGS that the community prefers, and why? Shipping/Protection (Immediate Concern): This is my most urgent question! I currently do not have penny sleeves or card savers/toploaders. For a temporary solution until I can buy proper supplies, I'm currently using a makeshift method: Placing each card inside the smallest sandwich bag I have. Sandwiching the bagged card between two 5x5-inch pieces of cut-out cardboard. Securing the cardboard with rubber bands in a cross-pattern. Is this an acceptable temporary storage/shipping method to prevent damage while I wait for proper supplies to arrive? I'm worried the rubber bands might be too tight. 💰 Post-Grading: Wh",

    "text": "I do not understand the pricing of this card The 2009 Charizard Cracked Ice holo from the Platinum Arceus set has interesting pricing. From what I understand, the price is so low because it was offered as a promo card in a tin. However, even though it was a card you could simply purchase in a tin, after 16 years, it still only has a PSA 9 population of 229 and a PSA 10 population of 26. On top of that, up until 3 weeks ago, the price of a PSA 10 was only about $1200, until 2 weeks ago when one was suddenly sold in an Ebay auction for $9300. PSA 9 is still going for around the $200 mark. It's obvious that this card is highly illiquid and not very sought after, but I'm just wondering why that is, and if someone can explain to me why it's so cheap in a PSA 9, and why the population is so low even though the card was readily available for purchase in a tin?",

Is Panini still going to release all its same lines season, but unlicensed? And what happens to all the premium/unique lines like immaculate, national treasures, court kings, black, etc. Panini had so many lines that took them so many years to build, do you guys think we’re just going to have one or two tops basketball lines for the next few seasons? And then what happens to all the penny cards that exist with a licensing? Will they eventually lose any value? So many questions! Thanks!",

    "text": "Crack and resend or resend for review? Hey everyone, I’ve got a question and would love some opinions from those with grading experience. Question: Should I crack and resend, or resend for review? For context — I’ve been submitting cards for grading for a while and I’m pretty strict about what I send in. My pre-grading standards are tough, and so far I’ve had about a 92% PSA 10 rate out of 103 total cards I’ve submitted. I know that’s not a massive number for some, but I’d say I’m fairly confident in my eye for grading. Recently, I sent in the card as shown in the pictures. The grader notes mentioned a dent along the right side (no specification if it was on the front or back). After checking it myself, showing it to a few friends and vendors who grade regularly, and even having Beckett take a look — everyone agreed there’s no dent at all. I even checked it under a blacklight and found nothing. I’ve helped friends crack and resend cards before, but I’ve never personally done a review submission — where you send in the slab as-is for PSA to reassess it. So... what would you do? Crack and resend, or send for review? Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with similar situations.",

The person that I submitted the order with had a spare card-saver iv that I was switching the card in to but he said it's fine to leave in the toploader. But the toploader isn't listed in the email as a possible violation, and I've seen PSA say themselves that thick cards are fine to send in toploaders instead of card-savers. I'm confused and of course think that they're sending me this violation as a cover-your-ass because they damaged one of my cards. Frustrating.",

    "text": "Hi r/RiftboundTCG 🏴☠️ We're a small team of 3 friends who left our jobs last year to build something we wished existed: a simple, clean tool to track our TCG collections and organize trades and decks. Over the past 3 months, we quietly launched a private beta with support for 8 games — including Riftbound — and today, we’d love to invite folks from this amazing new TCG community to try it out and tell us what’s missing. **What we've built for Riftbound:** * 🆓 A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch) * 💸 Real-time price syncing with Cardmarket & TCGPlayer * 📊 Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early * 🗂️ Custom trade lists, deck-building lists, or whatever you collect * 🌍 Multi-TCG support: MTG, Pokémon, Lorcana, Flesh and Blood, Sorcery, One Piece, Rise TCG and now Riftbound (more coming soon) **This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on user feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 3 months ago and have started sharing our tool with the smaller TCG communities, but we feel that the time has come to share it with the Riftbound community before the big launch. **👉** We’re opening 200 early-access invites to the Riftbound community here: [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=riftboundtcg](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=riftboundtcg) **We're giving away 1 Origins Booster Box to one of the first 200 player who:** 1. Joins via the invite link 2. Adds some cards to their collection 3. Creates a list (trade / wishlist / decklist — your choice!) Our marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker will stay free forever. We're in this for the long haul - building the tools we wish existed to easily build decks, trade cards, and understand where your portfolio stands. We're still in beta, and we're really looking for some feedback/ideas to improve it, especially from the early Riftbound community. What features would make this invaluable fo",

The seller answered my question and also said they were hoping for the auction to get bid up higher because they would only make a few dollars if it sold for the starting bid. I thought that was weird but didn’t think much about it again until a few hours before the auction ended, an account with 0 feedback started bidding on the item. I was immediately suspicious and stopped bidding. The account with 0 feedback won the auction. To no one’s surprise, the seller just relisted the same item a few days later with a higher starting bid. I can’t find a way to report them so I just blocked them and won’t buy from them, but PSA if you are a seller, shill bidding is FRAUD and it’s ILLEGAL.",

It solves the pain of tracking card values, organizing collections, and staying on top of market trends. **Key Features:** - AI scanning with 95%+ accuracy (snap a photo, instant identification) - Real-time eBay pricing integration - Batch scanning (upload 50+ cards at once) - Price alerts when cards spike - Reddit buzz tracking - Works with all sports + Pokemon TCG **The Journey:** Started knowing zero about coding. Went through multiple pivots (trading platform → platform generator → fantasy sports → back to cards). Every step taught me something I needed for the next. Built the entire stack myself: React frontend, Node backend, Claude AI integration, Stripe payments, all of it. **Tech Stack:** - Frontend: React, Tailwind - Backend: Node.js, Express - Database: PostgreSQL - AI: Claude Vision API - Hosting: Railway + Vercel Would love your feedback! We're live on Product Hunt today: https://www.producthunt.com/products/slabtrack?utm_source=other&utm_medium=social Happy to answer any questions about the journey or the tech! 🚀",

    "text": "Determining Signature Card Values Obviously price is what the market dictates, but seeing how this question is asked a hundred times as the cards get opened, thought id share my thoughts and would like yours. As of right now Lee Sin signed is marked as sold on Tcg $1,200. Then ive seen ebay listings in fb group of Ahri $400ish and Voli $700ish My personal opinion is a good amount would be 2x value of what we see from Chinese market (closest counterpart). Im basing this off of Pokémons Japanese to English comparison. Japan being english pokemons closest counterpart. Also to get a signed card is around 30 boxes or 720 packs. When compared to something like Pokemon chase card the Unbreon Vmax which is about 1/2000 packs. I dont know the math on specific signatures, it might be higher. That card at that rarity sat at $600-$800 for longest time before the scalper boom past year and half. Now people might say wait... theres 15 signature card types, so pulling a specific one is significantly harder, so value should be higher. But i argue that the difference in Pokemon comparison is theres no cards (except rayquaza) from that set that came even close to the price point. So until the characters popularity come into play, they should all be around the same value and highly tradable. Just something to consider. Seeing the chinese market i would say English signature should be around $400-$600. That being said we saw what leesin sold and people are asking $2k already. But in a month hundreds of signed cards will flood the market cutting that in half or more id imagine. What are your thoughts?",

The only thing wrong with this card is the centering on the back is off right to left. I’ve taken this to card shops and to sports card conventions and the dealers who I’ve talked to who also grade cards have all said that this would be a minimum 8.5 on the grading system, just because the centering on the back. I’ve held onto this card since I got it in a pack when I was a freshman in high school in 79-80 waiting to sell it. It looks like a defect on the top but it’s the lighting and reflection. The edges are all clean, the colors are still bright, it’s centered on the front almost perfect. There are no spots. I’m just devastated with this grade. Do you think the graders were just having a bad day? I just don’t get it, especially comparing these images with the cards that have sold on Heritage auctions with some of the issue they have like centering which had much higher grades than this.

    "text": "Burgerchu Tank Made a post last month that led to a good mix of agreement and disagreement. I presented strong evidence that burgerchu was only being held up by shill bidding, and that when volume pressure (constant PSA vault auction lots of 200+ slabs at once) forced the shill bidders to stop, price would tank and not stop tanking. I had thought an initial floor of $100, but looking at future auctions there are only more and more huge lots coming. When the dust settles, I wonder how many people think that buying these en masse at ~$50 would be a better use of capital than other cards. The card does have a more interesting “story” behind it and will be memorable going into the future, but the signs were clear that buying at 200 or even 300-400+ like many did was a terrible move in the present.",

TDLR: buyer opened chargeback through their CC 147 days after recieving the item Today, i recieved an update from ebay that the dispute details were updated. https://imgur.com/a/TV8O51P I can challenge the dispute of course and they gave me another 5 days to upload screenshots and type, etc. Not sure if this is good news/normal? It has been 17 days since i challenged the dispute the first time, where I only uploaded 2-3 screenshots of me offering open returns to the buyer etc. So far i've gathered 11 total screenshots ranging from conversations with the buyer, signature confirmation by the buyer, etc. UPDATE: i received an email from ebay \"We’re letting you know that this dispute is eligible for eBay Seller Protection. You’re not responsible for the dispute amount and the dispute fee. We’ll close the dispute once we receive the final outcome from the buyer’s payment institution. Right now there’s nothing you need to do.\" I guess this is somehow related to the change in dispute reasoning because if it stayed as \"doesnt match description\" i was most likely going to be scammed out of the bracelet and money. I called ebay who happily informed me (they wouldn't budge on letting me know who the dispute was through, mastercard, visa, etc) that it was through PAYPAL. i was told that no matter what they decide, i would not have to pay a dime. we will see because the same way the customer changed the reason for dispute today, im assuming they can just change it back whenever. Before i respond to the dispute, i wanted to come here and ask for help because that's what i was told to do last time when i responded first, then asked for help second lol.",

    "text": "Never sell luxury items on eBay I’ve been selling on eBay for years, and for the most part, my experience has been fine. I’ve sold tons of low-priced items with little to no issue. But recently, when trying to sell a few luxury pieces, I had this feeling eBay never protect their sellers. I sold a Louis Vuitton bucket hat ealier this year. Without any communication at all, the buyer directly filed a dispute through their bank, not even through eBay, not even talked to me. There was no message, no reason, no return, just a chargeback. eBay said they would “fight for my rights as a seller, and talked to the bank” but after 3 months of waiting, 3 MONTH! I lost both the money and the item. No explanation, no follow-up, nothing. There’s absolutely no real seller protection when the buyer goes through their bank instead of eBay. The second time, I sold a Balenciaga hat (with the original receipt from the store). The buyer insisted it was fake because it didn’t look identical to another Balenciaga product he owned, which is absurd, since even within the same brand, manufacturing differences are normal. I accepted the return request just to resolve it peacefully. But then the buyer left me a huge negative review, all caps shouting “FAKE” in his review, extremely rude and completely baseless. EBay refused to remove this feedback, even though I had proof of authenticity and accepted the return. And of course, sellers aren’t allowed to leave any kind of negative review for buyers, so we just have to take it. I’ve learned my lesson. EBay is not a safe place to sell luxury items. There’s zero protection for sellers dealing with high-value goods. Buyers can make false claims, file chargebacks, and eBay will just shrug and say “we tried.” If you ever plan to sell anything designer or pricey, don’t use eBay. It’s not worth the stress or the loss.",

    "text": "Why is the non-pokemon center ETB so expensive if the top chase in the set is less than the price of the chase? I remember when I checked TCGPlayer/Pricecharting for the ETB prices back in June, I had just bought one each with my girlfriend and she was considering holding onto one for the future to trade for sets down the line. I convinced her to open both and I got the charizard! However I've noticed the price of the ETB go up in the past 4 months from 80 dollars for an ETB to 140-170, while the top chase card has always actually been cheaper than the price of an etb. As a preface, I want to say that I'm not a scalper or anything, I just like looking at the prices of the cards I have. I'm just curious as to what the supply/demand balance is here and why prices for the etb are so high.",

The item sold is custom jewelry. Hello, looking for some insight here. I sold an expensive item (10k+) on May 9th, 2025. Item was delivered to buyer on May 13th, 2025. I received the \"Buyer has filed a dispute with their payment institution\" on October 7th, 2025. I challenged the dispute the same day, stating it was past the return policy (14 days) and past the eBay 30 day policy, and the fact that I encouraged the buyer to open a return and I would accept if the buyer was not happy with the size, color, or for any reason. The buyer reason: \"The item doesn't match the description in your listing\" Buyer comments: \"I messaged the seller but he's not responding\" Buyer messaged once saying \"hello\" on September 29th. Account age: 19 years old 100% buyer feedback 18 items sold 100% feedback (all items 5k-10k) Item was not in ebay's authenticity guarantee program, I do have a ebay \"store\". I sold another item for $7k 2 weeks prior to the dispute, and now ebay is obviously witholding my funds for that item. Has anyone been through this for this large of an amount and this later on after delivery? Do i have any recourse with ebay other than the \"appeal\"? Can I expect eBay to protect me/ban this buyer from the platform? Basically, from what I've read on chargebacks, the scammer will most likely get to keep my 12k item, while ebay reimburses using by 7k payout, so im essentially out 20k+?",

    "text": "Update on My Missing Mega Charizard X EX From Whatnot “Qualitypulls”– Not Satisfied Hey everyone — just wanted to give an update on my situation with the Mega Charizard X EX SAR 110/080 (Japanese Inferno X) that I pulled on Whatnot back on October 7. USPS tracking (92001903478427300484215881) still shows the package was never accepted, meaning the seller never shipped my card. I sent Whatnot all the proof — tracking, screenshots, video of the pull, and even other buyer reviews showing similar issues with this same seller. After weeks of waiting, I finally got this response from Whatnot (screenshot attached). They determined the “market value” of my missing card is $720, refunded what I paid ($48.23), and gave me $671.77 in Whatnot credit. Here’s the problem: • The actual raw value of my card is around $750–$900, not $720. • Graded, the same card sells for $2,000+ (PSA 10) and up to $12,000 (BGS 10 Black Label). • And worst of all, it looks like the seller still has his account active, even though there are multiple reports of him doing the same thing to others. I appreciate Whatnot for at least responding, but this outcome doesn’t sit right. The platform basically gave me partial value in credit while the seller gets to keep a potentially $2,000+ card. That’s not justice. Buyers — please be careful out here. Scammers are getting smarter, and even when you have all the proof, you might still end up shortchanged. Whatnot needs to do better protecting its buyers. We spend real money on this platform, and scammers like this ruin the trust for everyone.",

It was the launch of the \"Secret Scare Superdrop,\" a highly sought-after collection of premium, limited-edition card sets. But within minutes, that anticipation devolved into a now-familiar ritual of frustration, futility, and fury. Customers who logged on at the 9 a.m. PST launch were thrust into a virtual queue, with wait times ticking into hours. The most agonizing part, however, wasn't the wait. It was the false hope. Multiple players reported the same crushing experience: after finally getting through the queue two hours later, they would successfully add the desired $40 bundles to their cart. They would proceed to checkout, enter their payment and shipping details, and click \"confirm.\" Only then would they be met with an error message: the items were sold out. Their carts were empty. The product had been sold from under them while they were typing in their credit card number. This \"cart jac",

    "text": "Bought a Fake Card Through eBay’s Authentication Guarantee – eBay Refusing to Help Hi all, I recently purchased a Pokemon card on eBay that was covered under their Authentication Guarantee program. The card was authenticated by PSA and arrived sealed in the tamper proof packaging. However, upon inspection, it's clear that the card is a fake, (Static holo pattern, holo matches with TCGPlayer, 1st Edition stamp is not lined up properly) despite PSA marking it as authentic. I did not do my due diligence prior to purchasing due to it being through the Authentication Guarantee, now I wish I should have. I contacted eBay immediately. They redirected me to another department and unfortunately, they refused to offer a return or refund. Their reasoning was that they trust PSA’s authentication process and won’t override it, even in the case of a clear mistake. Here’s where I currently stand: * I’ve contacted PSA directly and am awaiting their response as they review the case. * The card remains sealed in its tamper proof packaging - I haven’t opened it to ensure the chain of custody is intact. * I'm considering a chargeback as a last resort, but I'd prefer to explore all possible avenues before going down that road. It’s frustrating that eBay’s authentication program which is supposed to protect buyers seems to leave no room for recourse when the authenticator gets it wrong. And ironically, PSA’s involvement has limited my ability to open a standard claim under eBay’s Money Back Guarantee. Any advice on next steps, other contacts, or how to escalate this situation? Thanks in advance.",

    "text": "how do youngsters buy sports cards nowadays ? / brainstorming on how we can help youngsters collecting cards. When I was a kid, I lived in a middle class family. high end cards (u/d mostly ) were 4-5$/pack and cheap cards (pro set) was under 1$. like many kids my age, I did dumb stuff, I had patrick roy and brett hull rookie cards when I was like 6 years old and completely destroyed them, they ended up round loll. when I realized what I did a few years later I decided to collect hockey cards.. there was card shops everywhere, the ambiance was awesome, I used to spend hours there almost daily. adults and such could afford the best looking series while I could only buy myself a pack of pro-set here and there, I was jealous, very eager to reach this point. the day I got my first foil from upper deck was a very special day. it was a gretzky foil worth some 18$ or so.. I was ecstatic. kept that card for 20 years. I recently restarted collecting cards and noticed that everything changed. the price are out of this world, there are 200 different flavors you can buy. and they are all upper-deck. after some digging I came to pinpoint the culprit to be the diamond classification upper deck attributes to a dealer. this essencially killed the moms and pops card shop, now only huge stores remain where there is pressure to buy and where the kids can't afford sh1t all and are seen as a semi-nuisance. it got me somewhat angry.. I hated my experience, in fact I buy exclusively online now, I have not traded or sold a card since I restarted a few years back because there are no community, events or places where you can exchange about your passion, beside online forums with mostly trolls. kids cannot use ebay, or any of these trading apps. kids do not work, kids cannot generate 13$/day to buy a pack of cards. how the hell, is this hobby supposed to survive if it behaves like amateur radio boomers. the kids are left aside.. the future of the hobby is trampled on (and as a byproduct, the ",

Part 2 Quick update from my previous post about the return case: https://www.reddit.com/r/eBaySellerAdvice/s/tCxZFmOD80 Thanks to everyone who helped and shared information on how to deal with this kind of buyer! The buyer is now repeatedly messaging me, insisting on a partial refund even though eBay has already confirmed that I should not issue or discuss any refunds until the item is returned and verified. I’ve made it clear to the buyer that The case is under eBay’s investigation and that I’ll only follow eBay’s official process. Despite that, the buyer keep sending messages trying to pressure me into a deal. I’ve reported each message under Scam for manipulating the refund process and I don’t even have the option to issue a partial refund on my end and at this point I’m just waiting for eBay’s decision, but it’s frustrating that the buyer is still trying to negotiate outside the system. Should I reply anything back to him? As a bonus, I noticed that the buyer has two active listings for the exact same figure both using the same photo he sent me to claim “damage.” So essentially, he’s trying to sell the figure he said arrived damaged, while also pushing for a refund from me. Thank you again!",

    "text": "Why is PSA the go to? So just got back into collecting this past summer after collecting in the early 90s. Grading wasn't really a thing back then so been trying to learn the ins and outs about it. I'm getting ready to get my first cards graded ever... some for my pc, couple others to sell. That being said why is PSA the general go to for grading? I understand that the resale prices are much higher than the others, but can't understand why... just seems you keep resubmit until you get a 10. As a kid, i got the Beckett price guide each month so was kind of surprised to learn how Beckett isn't at least a major contender(?) I've read that it's possibly because the sub grades, and ppl prefer 10 versus 9.5 but the prices can sometimes seem so far apart. Maybe other features things like PSA vault or psa offers are really compelling. From everything I've been reading it feels like Beckett is more consistent in grading, wouldn't that be important for grading? Just generally confused by it all... i know there are other companies as well. I am considering a couple cards for my pc to get graded by tag only because the case looks sleek and i think will display better in the house. I haven't seen anything said about the slabs itself so hopefully they're solid. Any other info or tips is greatly appreciated. I am aware of the submission process and vids they have online. PSA does have an event coming up near me so considering doing a drop off at the event.",

    "text": "BGS vs PSA: How Did Beckett Lose So Much Ground in Value? I might be biased since I love BGS slabs and the level of detail they put into grading, but why does almost every PSA 9 (or below) outperform its Beckett equivalent in value? Why can’t a BGS 9 be worth the same? In many cases, the price gap is surprisingly big. I feel BGS 9.5 should be closer to PSA10 in price. Also, is it true that BGS tends to grade vintage cards more favorably than PSA? I’ve seen a lot of comments from collectors saying PSA is harsher on vintage stuff. Curious to hear your thoughts or experiences.",

The 1st bowman logo is missing its blue outline around the “1st”, the B in the Chrome logo is missing the classic stitching across the top of the B. The icing on the cake though is the Mariners logo on the bottom left, not a single letter is even decipherable. The worst part about this though is it is currently listed for $13,000 by a seller with over 1,400 positive feedback and over 2,000 items sold. Not posting the seller details or anything because like I said, they seem to be a reputable seller and have only positive reviews. More than anything just wanted to make a post to see what other people think about this.",

    "text": "Hey all, so I’ve looked at 130point for comps to get an idea of value, but it seems these Ohtani 1/1s vary from sale to sale. I know there are reasons for this (RC, patch/ no patch, on card vs sticker etc), but it’s tough to nail down a solid value. Then there’s going about selling it. I just can’t figure out the best way of doing this. Incredible fees with eBay and Goldin, it’s just been tough to find the best way. So I guess I’m just asking for advice here. How would you go about selling it and what would you expect to get for it? And thank you in advance to anyone responding, it is greatly appreciated.",

    "text": "Anyone have experience buying through SCC consignments in Shanghai on Ebay since tariffs? They told me in a message that they ship “duty paid” so they cover tariffs. Has anyone ordered through them? Hopefully it’s true. They are a massive seller with 99.9 positive feedback. Also - I wanted to share this, what I consider a little hack. They charge 24.99 to ship - which from China makes sense...SO, generally you can buy auctions for at least 25 less than you would normally, plus even less because the shipping turns additional people away and a lot of people don’t want to wait a month for cards. BUT you can combine shipping for 1 dollar additional per card. So here’s the hack. There are a ton of cards that start their bid at 99 cents. They might be a 5 or 6 dollar Jordan - but no one is paying 25 bucks to ship that card. So you can bid on your main card - for instance I just bought a Joe Montana PSA 7 card for 75 bucks less than I can sell it for. And now I’ll add like 10 additional 1 dollar cards for 10 bucks shipping. And the card will value probably 60 to 70 bucks!",

    "text": "Buyer requested refund after 8 days, what to do? First-time poster here I’d really appreciate some advice on what to do in this situation. A bit of background: I sold a limited edition Funko Pop (9,500 pcs) on eBay. I uploaded detailed close-up photos showing the box was in perfect condition ,no creases or damage. It sold quickly since I listed it at a lower price than others. The buyer paid immediately, and I shipped the next day. I packed it extremely well: layers of bubble wrap, plenty of padding, and “fragile” tape all around. The Pop was also in a protective case. I even took photos of the packaging before sending it out. The parcel was delivered on October 3rd, but today the buyer requested a return and refund, claiming the box was damaged. I compared the photos, and it’s definitely not the same box I sent it looks like they swapped it. I also checked their profile and saw they resell similar figures for almost double the price. It’s been 8 days since delivery, and I already received my payout. What are my options here? How should I handle it through eBay if I’m confident they switched the item? Thanks in advance for any advice!",

    "text": "Most ‘I Buy Sports Cards’ Buyers Disappear When You Mention eBay Sold Prices 😅😭 I recently messaged about 20 local buyers who advertise that they purchase sports cards. I told them I have a large collection with many high value pieces. For several of them, I even sent photos of some of my better cards. Almost all of them asked whether I had cards of specific players (including rookies), and I said yes. In the end, I explained that my collection is very large I have cards from almost every sport and many players. I said if someone wants to buy in person, I’m willing to sell below market, roughly 70% of market value for most items, and I’d do my best to make a deal. I also said I would price based on recent eBay sold listings. As soon as I mentioned eBay sold comps, most of them lost interest. So I’m asking, do these people actually want to buy cards... or are they trying to pressure sellers into letting valuable collections go at unreasonably low prices? Unfortunately, scammers and predatory buyers are everywhere. Please be careful. My advice to fellow collectors _Don’t let strangers set your prices. Always check recent eBay sold listings (not asking prices) and use that as your baseline. _Know your range. If you need quick cash, decide your discount in advance (e.g., 70–85% of market depending on card/liquidity). Don’t let someone talk you down further on the spot. _Meet safely & in public if selling locally. _Be cautious with “I buy collections” posts. 🚨😅 Many of these buyers only want deep discounts far below comps. If someone refuses to use sold data, that’s a red flag. _Remember you have options. If you’re patient, you can sell online a little below market and still do better than a lowball local offer. Stay safe, do your own research, and protect the value of your collection",

My dad passed away about 4 years ago and left my sister and me millions of sports cards — mostly baseball but some other sports too.

He had thousands of cards graded and kept a detailed price book, but we honestly can’t make sense of any of it. We don’t know how to spot the more valuable cards or where to even start. We’re also realistic that we’ll probably take a loss if we sell everything, but we don’t want to just give away something that might have value.

The listing did not include a chain, and I have a specific disclaimer in my listings that anything other than the main item (props, other pieces of jewelry etc) are *not* included in the listing. I had some extra 925 nib chains, so I tossed one in as a free gift. Cause it's a pendant and a chain would be nice if they needed one, right? The item passed authentication but failed because it didn't match photos. Because of the free chain I added. This was verified by CS. The buyer didn't even have the choice to accept or reject, it was just automatically sent back. Maybe I'm just stupid or naive, idk.

    "text": "To PSA for your false advertisement The “Value max 20 days” claim doesn’t match what customers are experiencing. Packages are sitting **6–8 weeks before intake even opens the box**, and the 20-day clock only starts after that. Add in the recent price increase and we’re paying more for slower service. If submission volume is high, that’s an operational challenge the company should solve by staffing and paying graders appropriately, not by shifting the delay onto customers. Reasonable fixes: 1. Start the turnaround timer at **delivery scan**, not “box opened.” 2. Publish **real, rolling TATs** that reflect the full wait from delivery. 3. **Credit or partial refund** for orders exceeding the posted 20 days measured from delivery. Collectors shouldn’t be losing time and market value while fees go up. Align the promise with the process or compensate the difference. **ChatGPT drama is noise. Start the clock at delivery, publish intake + grading stats, and stop hiding behind vague disclaimers. Consumers deserve to know where their assets are and for how long. If AI offends you, don’t use it. It’s 2025. Facts don’t change because a tool wrote them.** Not an anti-PSA rant, just a transparency issue. Through August my Value Plus orders averaged \\~30 days and Value Max \\~25. September suddenly ran far longer with no notice. Had I known intake might take 2+ months just to open the box, I wouldn’t have sent them. During a delay that long, anything can happen to the cards, and PSA will grade them as-is. [https://www.psacard.com/info/submission-delays](https://www.psacard.com/info/submission-delays) Fees up. TATs up. Intake = black box. When the box lands at your building, give three dates: open-by, grading-start, grades-ready. 27k eyes on this. PSA, escalate. Fans, AI haters, STFU chorus — clarity wins.",

    "text": "Seller messaged me after 3 months... Claiming that a graded Pokemon card I sold was fake. A few immediate red flags popped up for me - 1) I sold as a set of 3, non sequentially numbered, but if 1 was “fake” then wouldn’t the whole set be? 2) buyer purchased in late July. Why are they reaching out now? 3) whenever I am in possession of a graded card/item, I do my due diligence and verify the cert number. When I originally bought the card that the buyer is claiming to be fake, it showed up on the website with a picture. Did the buyer just blindly buy my item and not research herself? Was the card reported “stolen” after I sold it, between date of sale and when she reached back out? Any help appreciated",

I list this as the only shipping type, and there is no issue listing this in this manner setting up the listing. However, on checkout, eBay does not allow me to select large envelope as the shipping type on an order. When I search and find \"large envelope\", it is grayed out and it says that shipping type is not allowed for the class of item. The cheapest shipping allowed on the site is Ground Advantage, which usually costs twice as much. Is there a way to bypass this restriction?

    "text": "I have always been a pretty big eBay buyer, but I just did a few auctions and eBay is just not what it used to be for graded comics. First, the inventory doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be. Second, if anything is good it is often over priced trying to drive you to sellers web age. Third, if I do find what looks to be a decent auction I always seem to lose as \"second highest bidder\". This last one happens so often now it has to be something fishy (even though I don't have proof). I also used to frequent the CGC forum's, inventory also seems scarce there. Are people just sitting on big books because market is down? I know about ComicLink, MyComicShop, and Heritage but would prefer more eBay style auctions. I personally hate social media so don't do Instagram, or whatnot. The later I can't stand you can barely inspect the book before someone buys. I want good pictures, not someone holding it in front of a camera for 5 seconds telling me what the grade is. I want a chance to grade it myself. I just tried FB Marketplace but frankly good stuff is rare where I live. Am I missing someplace, where did all the eBay buyers/sellers go? Feels like the online market is splintered and while I hated eBay for fees, it was a pretty safe place for buyers and it was kind of nice almost everyone/thing was there.",

    "text": "Unable to pickup psa graded cards from my local store Hey everyone, I honestly didn’t know where to post this because I am honestly so lost so here I am. I sent in some pokemon cards to be graded through my local GameStop and was told it would take about 2.5 months to turnaround and come back. The problem started when my pro account attached to the submission was deleted and I was told it can’t be restored, it’s been over three months since I sent my cards in to be graded and they came back to the store around a month to a month and a half ago, the store says they cannot give me any of my cards because the submission no longer exists. They first told me they had to get clearance from psa (which never happened) and then told me they could transfer the submission over to another account so they could mark the cards as picked up. I was told the transfer to the other account would take around 48 business hours and it’s now been about 3 weeks since that conversation. I’ve tried calling them to discuss any other steps we could take but have been met with lukewarm responses or a “sorry there is nothing we can do”. I have honestly ran out of patience and would really just like the cards I submitted and got graded back. Is there anything I can do as the customer and owner of the cards? TLDR: I submitted my cards over 3 months ago and I’m not allowed to pick them up, what should I do?",

    "text": "2024 Championship Stamped Zoro (P-042) Saw a write up here by someone of another card from the CS2024 series. Although there’s a few nice ones from the 24 Series, I’m a big fan of the gold stamped Zoro promo and I believe them to be very slept on especially for an extremely popular character from the Straw Hats. The art is unique and has a nice textured finish (though there’s an even nicer Finalist version). The gold foil on the stamp is a nice premium touch and the card really pops in person, which is why I think people will opt for this version over the one without a stamp. I think this one is going to do well short term and long term. Grading wise, there is currently not one Black Label submission for this card (I’m hoping to fix that) although only 23 have been subbed to Beckett - one person got a 6.5 lol. PSA pop count is only 74 total which is crazy for a unique art of one of the most popular characters but with the recent buyout I think this will slowly creep up. Recently there’s been a few sales with people paying well over market for this on eBay and there’s only 11 left on TCG Player but some are overpriced. Cardmarket as usual lag behind with trends so take advantage of that marketplace if youre in the EU! (Note: the guy on Cardmarket with the card at €4 is the non stamped version) I have one copy already but will be picking a few more of these up and trying for the Beckett Black Label which would be the very first ever! Longshot here but if anyone has sealed finalist packs from the 2024 series please reach out! I ripped my one hoping for the Zoro but now want another sealed one back in the collection.

    "text": "Hey everyone, I recently bought a Giratina Pokémon card on Whatnot. After receiving it, I had it physically authenticated by PCA (Professional Cards Authenticator), a trusted grading/authentication company in Europe. 👉 PCA officially confirmed in writing that the card is a counterfeit. I have the certificate from them proving this. However, Whatnot’s Trust & Safety team replied to me saying the card is authentic because they checked it using LegitApp – an app that only reviews photos, not the actual card. They are ignoring the PCA attestation and refusing to process my refund. This is extremely frustrating, because: PCA examined the card physically, not just a picture. Whatnot is relying on a mobile app over a recognized professional authenticator. I’m now stuck with a fake card and no refund, unless they reconsider. Has anyone else here dealt with similar issues with Whatnot? What are the best next steps – pushing again with PCA’s document, contacting my payment provider, or escalating legally? Thanks in advance for any advice – I don’t want other collectors to get scammed the same way.",

I've seen recent raw sales on eBay for cards in what looks to be similar or worse condition sell for between $7,000 and $9,000. I'm weighing that against the pros and cons of grading. I'm considering the grading fees, the cost of insuring it for shipping (twice), and the stress of mailing a high-value card. This is before even considering the final seller fees on a platform like eBay. I've never submitted a card for grading before. Based on the photos in the album, what do you think the potential grade range for this card could be? What would you do in my position? Grade it, or sell it as is? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! UPDATE: Wow thanks for all the replies here. After receiving a lot of messages, and reading your posts here I decided to pursue grading the card. Special shoutout to [u/Dracanherz](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dracanherz/) for the IRL **'PSA drop-off event -> PSA Vault' strategy.** I'm running with that... as it removes the shipping concern I had. If I remember I'll come back here and update everyone what the grade ended up being. Thanks again!",

    "text": "International buyer fishing for a partial Hi I sold a vintage leather handbag, it was an international sale and was shipped through the global snipping program. Buyer received the item today and immediately sent a message complaining about marks on the bag and a “funky smell”. In my listing the condition of the bag was described as “acceptable” and many photos were provided of all angles to show the scuffs / signs of wear / imperfections. The buyer has 0 feedbacks btw! I’ve suggested that the buyer return the bag twice. I’ve a seller for years on eBay and never once have had someone complain about a “smell.” I always add lots of photos of items with imperfects / defects. There was no pen stains on or in the bag. It was a black leather bag, and the lining was also black so I genuinely have no idea what this buyer is talking about. What would you do in my situation? I think it’s obvious the buyer is trying to get some money back.",

I recently got an acrylic case delivered, so I finally took it out of the tin and plastic wrap that I was keeping it safe in. Though it is has some slight wear and a couple small splits in the corners, it's still my gem! Just started playing the Early Days Collection on Switch because of all the nostalgia. I can't help but wonder how many of these could be out there. There's very few sales of the first run with the GOAT promos, most coming from Heritage Auctions. I saw the Ruxin video from a while ago where he got scammed with a resealed one, but didn't know his pirce or if he got another one after that.",

I asked where the price point is coming from, as last solds on Ebay are between £110-£120 / $150-$160. He said he uses Collectr app for pricing. So i went on Collectr app, and its valuing the TAG10 on there at £90 / $120. So, i asked where the $200 counter offer price point is coming from. The above was their response.

The card looked flawless, even got a response from Goldin noting how amazing the card looked. Upon arrival with Golden, they sent the card to PSA where it lived from May until it returned last week. The card returned a PSA 8 and with a line on the card that was not there pre shipment. The card is now up for auction. Has anyone had experiences like this with Goldin and if so, what was your course of action and remedy? My rep is slow playing me and when he responds, it's not to my specific questions. This is my fault for not selling it raw on eBay in May, but I thought Goldin's reach was a better play due to this being a Roki /5. Appreciate learning of your experiences.",

After years of collecting and trading at events across the US, we kept encountering the same problems every serious collector faces. Tracking our collection values was a mess of spreadsheets. Organizing potential trades meant juggling eBay sold listings, price guides, and scattered notes. And we never really knew our portfolio's true performance over time. **Sound familiar?** So we built CardNexus - a modern portfolio tracker designed specifically for collectors who actually care about the value and organization of their collections. **What we've built so far:** * 🆓 A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch) * 💸 Real-time price syncing across multiple marketplaces * 📊 Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early * 🗂️ Custom lists for trading, selling, or just organizing your collection * 🌍 Multi-category support: TCGs (Magic, Pokémon, Lorcana) and soon sports cards **This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on collector feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 8 weeks ago with the TCG community, but we're expanding to serve the broader collecting world. Today, we're opening 200 beta spots for r/collectors ! We're offering a **$200 collectibles credit** (your choice - TCGPlayer, eBay, or whatever marketplace you prefer) to one lucky member who joins via our link, uploads their collection, and creates a trade/sell list! **Get your invite here** —> [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=collectors](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=collectors) Our marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker w",

I had all my cards from the 80/90s stolen but recently started to get interested in collecting a handful of my favorite players.

Stopped collecting by the time I was 16, and forgot what I had. I was at my parents this weekend, and pulled out the binder. I knew I had a decent amount of the set, but thought I was maybe halfway there... turns out I only have 51 to go, and the only \"big card\" I'm missing is Nolan Ryan! Set building was way harder pre-internet. Beckett was the card bible, and eBay didn't exist, so it was a hunt to build sets.

    "text": "No Update or Refund on Missing Beckett Grading Services Card Submission After a Whole Year. [Advice] Hey all, As the title suggest I submitted card for grading through Beckett Grading Services (BGS) and have not heard anything about them in almost a year despite me talking to multiple customer service representatives to work and try to resolve this issue. I will try to refrain from insulting BGS throughout this post. Back in October of 2024 I submitted my first round of cards to get graded. I decided to grade though BGS since they were attending a local con near me and it would be easy to submit in-person with first party BGS reps. I submitted 11 cards from the Stellar Crown set paid in-person for the base service w/subgrades and insurance. **December 2024:** I saw my order appear through the website and listed as \"pending\" so i assumed that they were received and in the process of being graded. **February 2025:** I emailed customer service and they said I had an outstanding balance on my account despite me already paying in person. I provided receipts and order form. They assured me that they would locate my order. and get back to me. **# of** **BGS reps investigating order : 1** **March-April 2025:** I submit multiple customer service tickets that receive no reply. Eventually my order disappears off the BGS website all together.

    "text": "PSA 6 turned PSA 10??? PSA I need clarity. Months ago I submitted a Zekrom & Pikachu Tag Team promo. At the time of submission, the card was worth around $550-$600 in a 10. Weeks after I sent it in, the explosion of tag teams happened and this card over doubled in price to $1400 in a 10. Being super pumped that my card was going to be a lot more than it was when I submitted it. I couldn’t wait for it to be finished. Time goes by, I received report that my card got a 6. I thought there was absolutely no way that could be true. When I received the card I immediately broke it out of the slab and examined it under a very expensive microscope for literally 2 hours straight. Nothing. Just a virtually “perfect” card to PSA’s standards. (Btw on the pics, the black spec on the back is not actually on the card) I made a post questioning why it got a 6 and said I’d be resubmitting for a 9-10. Fast forward to today, I got the report back. GEM MT 10. Nothing about the card was changed or altered. It’s the same exact card that received as a 6. The price is now down $350 from what it was a month and a half ago when I received it initially. As an effect of their “misjudgment”, I missed out on good money, (selling amount and grading fees). This submission was expedited. So in total, I’ve spent $100 on grading just this card alone. I’m severely unhappy with their judgement. As a long time PSA user, I’ve had multiple inconsistencies with them in the last 4-5 months. For the time being, I will no longer be using PSA. 100% Perfect cards will go to BGS, Near perfect cards will go to TAG. I understand TAG is very new to Pokemon and is still working on a lot of things. I will be experimenting with them. But it’s really about clarity and seeing what’s wrong with my card. Rather than getting told my card is a 6 and to give them money. Guess what? They paid me $1,017 for the same exact card they told me was “valued at $86”!",

    "text": "Pokémon card prices have reached an absurd level. A Pikachu Illustrator card was just sold on eBay for $4 million! These cards are considered the rarest of all Pokémon cards – they were released in 1998 as a prize for the winners of a contest in Japan, with a print run of just 41 copies. These days, the price of cards depends on their condition, and the one just sold graded a PSA 9, which is very close to perfect (PSA 10). It's worth noting that just a week ago, the exact same card in the same condition was sold for \"only\" $625,000. And it should be added that four million for a Pokémon is still not a record, as in 2022, the -popular vlogger Logan Paul paid $5.25 million for an \"Illustrator\" card. That card, however, was in perfect condition. >More about games in our community.

    "text": "Ebay Sent Card to Wrong PSA Vault Email I purchased a card on ebay to send to PSA vault. I do this all the time seamlessly. However, one card has been stuck on \"shipped to PSA vault\" for a long time, and I have not received the confirmation that the card is \"Vaulted\" by PSA. The other problem is that this card never said \"To Vault\" in the PSA app like most cards to when in transit, though it did automatically appear in my collection. I contacted PSA about this issue and they gave me a canned response saying that the card is indeed secured in the vault, but attached to the wrong email. They suggest I make an account to link ebay to PSA, but I have obviously already done that. I used the same ebay email and everything (which is done automatically) that I always do, this cannot possibly be my fault. I'm waiting on their response, but this does not seem promising.

I sent this message: It’s astonishing that I even have to explain this, but here we are: a 30-year-old collectible Pepsi can is not something you purchase expecting a fresh, fizzy drink inside. Anyone with even the slightest grasp of common sense (or of how time works) should understand that after three decades, cans often lose their contents through natural seepage or evaporation. I accurately listed and sold a collectible can, not a beverage to quench your thirst. If you were under the impression that you’d be cracking it open for a refreshing sip of 1990s Pepsi, then the mistake is entirely yours, not mine. Next time, I suggest reading the description carefully and maybe asking yourself whether a 30-year-old soda can is meant for drinking—or for collecting.",

VHS -Records-Comics etc. While most of what I collect has a Price Guide, which makes it easier to figuer out a base price (sometimes more/sometimes less). VHS at the moment is like the wild west. Especially those of us who love in small cities. And this is not going to end anytime soon, as it is reminding me of the record collecting boom in the mid 2000's. I realize ebay is used for comps...but they are also insanely all.over the place . I'm probabaly over thinking it, but what do you all think? Should the hobby have an outline for pricing tapes?",

Anyhow, there are several times where I will often ship within an hour or 2 of getting the item sold notice - full product packaged for shipping, label printed, attached, and dropped off at the post office and off it goes. Ive seen people discussing accepting ebay offers on their listed items but getting a payment failed notice. Does it ever happen for auctions or BIN item sales? If so, what happens if you've already shipped the order and then a day or 2 later while the funds are stuck in processing - you get a payment failed notice.

    "text": "Sold a $250 pair of Pokemon cards, delivery says arrived, buyer did not find a package, eBay refunded them. What can I do. SOLVED! I shipped out maybe a month ago $250 worth of Pokemon cards to a buyer (who has very high ratings, trusted buyer) and they reached out about not receiving their package. So I did everything I could in my power to contact USPS and also contact EBAY. We all know how impossible both of these can be to work with as EBay is unresponsive and won’t even let you talk to them and USPS’ website is ancient doesn’t work half the time and I don’t think they will help me if the package officially says ‘delivered’ in their system. So even with insurance on the package, I don’t think I can get my money back from USPS. If I’m wrong about that point me in the right direction. I told the buyer to mark the item as ‘not received’ because EBay would not let me contact them or make any changes until a case was made. Which gave me 3 days to update tracking/talk to my buyer, which I did. The tracking on USPS’ official site says delivered and shows all of the tracking updates. eBay did not show all the tracking updates and just says ‘out to delivery to authenticator’. I don’t even know what an authenticator is or is needed for considering the cards are graded, and I’ve sold a 1k card and did not have this stupid process go on. Me and my buyer are extremely confused and feel like eBay just snapped up our extremely expensive purchase and is preventing us from working with them. I don’t know if somehow USPS is wrong when I feel their tracking is usually reliable, so I’m favored to believe EBay is messing something up on their end. They emailed me today that they sided with the buyer (clearly didn’t read anything about our case) and issued a full refund. Now I’m screwed out of my childhood cards and the cash I really needed. What the hell do I do. Update 1: Now I’ve received an over $40 charge to my bank account because that’s how much eBay decided to overcharge my b",

Look for other 1/1 cards with similar traits like brand, year, league, patch/auto etc. Then set a relative price yourself. \\---- Bookmark some of these helpful guides: **Determine the value of your trading cards** [https://sundocards.com/resources/determine-the-value-of-your-trading-cards/](https://sundocards.com/resources/determine-the-value-of-your-trading-cards/) **How to value your trading cards** [https://sundocards.com/how-to-value-your-trading-cards-a-beginners-step-by-step-guide/](https://sundocards.com/how-to-value-your-trading-cards-a-beginners-step-by-step-guide/) **Should I hold or sell?** [https://sundocards.com/resources/trading-cards-should-i-hold-or-sell/](https://sundocards.com/resources/trading-cards-should-i-hold-or-sell/) **Should I get this card graded?** [https://sundocards.com/resources/should-i-get-this-trading-card-graded/](https://sundocards.com/resources/should-i-get-this-trading-card-graded/) **Guide to PSA grading** [https://sundocards.com/resources/guide-to-psa-card-grading/](https://sundocards.com/resources/guide-to-psa-card-grading/) **Guide to refractors, parallels and foils** [https://sundocards.com/resources/the-complete-guide-to-types-of-parallels-refractors-and-holographic-hologram-trading-cards/](https://sundocards.com/resources/the-complete-guide-to-types-of-p",

    "text": "I’m pretty new to magic, I started last month with a friend and we’ve been enjoying it so far. He got into it cause of arena and the collabs, while I got into it because I love Final Fantasy, especially FF7. So because of my love for FF and FF7, I naturally want to collect all the FF7 cards. So I went onto tcgplayer and looked at the Sephiroth cards. I saw the full art Fabled Soldier and instantly fell in love with the look of the card but the price threw me off. $70 for a card seems so insane to me that I threw away the idea right away. So fast track to today, I go to a card shop to just go look around and maybe get a commander set or a few singles and that’s when I saw the full art foil borderless Sephiroth Fabled Soldier. I asked how much it was and ofc it was $75. I said that’s a bit much for me and went home. When I got home I was talking to my mom about it and how I don’t understand why cards are so expensive. Just normal talk yk. Well she went out to get groceries and without me knowing, went to the card shop and asked about it. Well she bought it, she bought the $75 card. I’m very grateful and I was extremely happy but now I feel guilty. I don’t like that she bought it because it bothers me that she spent $75 on a card when that money could’ve been used for something else. I’ve been thinking of returning the card and getting her money back because even though I love the card, I can’t even touch it without feeling wrong. Ik it’s just a card and in all reality it’s not that deep but I bothers me so much that I would much rather shred the card than keep it at this point. What do you guys think? Do you think I’m overthinking and overreacting? TLDR: Mom buys $75 card and I want to return it because spending that much on a card makes me feel terrible and the fact I didn’t buy it using my own money is eating at me. (Edit) I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did. I am having trouble answering all 600+ people in the comments but I want everyone to know that I app",

    "text": "Pro tip for dealing with buyers that message you If a buyer is interested in one of your listings and messages you, the **FIRST** thing you should do is check their feedback left for other sellers. You can't do this on the app, so use the desktop site. If their feedback left for other sellers has a troubling history (you determine the extent), there is a chance your sale may fall victim to a bad buyer. Then decide if you want to block the buyer before entertaining questions or extending an offer. I recently had a buyer ask for a discount on a $10 shipped item. Checked their feedback left for others and it's nothing but item issues after the sale. I immediately blocked the buyer. https://preview.redd.it/qn4lrympdonf1.jpg?width=818&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce703ddfc8eb364297b4ead1c5a6b2b454d0d85f",

    "text": "Just wanted to share my negative experience with \"Break'n Bad\" on fanatics live as an FYI to others. Since July I have spent over $925 with that shop purchasing various online cards breaks including one where I paid a little over $37 for a Topps Chrome Jumbo pack. I received the package on time but it only contained cards pulled from other orders I placed with them and no Jumbo Pack (I did receive a second Jumbo Pack I bought in a separate purchase/shipment just fine the same week). I messaged them through the fanatics site, got a couple replies including \"our shipping team may have just missed including that pack\", but its now been a week with no follow-up or resolution from them. I just filed a complaint with Fanatics, hoping they can help get this resolved, but its a let down to spend that much money with someone only to end up getting ignored when things go wrong. That's not the customer service someone would expect when a company drops the ball. Until this point, my experience with them was otherwise positive, but when someone doesn't fix their mistake that's a deal breaker for me, so I will not be purchasing again from them and will likely stop the whole site altogether, if fanatics can't make it right. Update 9/16/25: I filed a claim with Fanatics-live as previously stated (who responded very quickly) and received an update from the shop shortly thereafter (not sure if it was cause-and-effect or not). Just got a replacement jumbo pack from the shop, so they did ultimately make good on their end. Overall, its good to see both the shop and fanatics provide resolution, but it did unfortunately result in having to jump through several extra hoops on my side.",

    "text": "Dear r/mtgfinance Community, We are three friends passionate about Magic (and a few more TCGs since then) who quit our day jobs late last year to fulfill an old dream of starting our own company. After years of playing Magic competitively and trading cards at events across the US, we kept running into the same problems. Tracking our collection values was a mess of spreadsheets. Organizing trades meant juggling TCGPlayer tabs and scattered notes. And we never really knew our portfolio's true performance over time. So we built CardNexus - a modern portfolio tracker designed specifically for serious TCG players and collectors who care about value. **What we've built for MTG:** * A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch) * Week-on-week portfolio tracking - see how your collection's value changes over time * Real-time price tracking synced with the two major marketplaces * Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early * Custom lists for trades and deck building * Support for all MTG formats and sets (plus 5 other TCGs if you're diversified, such as Sorcery, Flesh and Blood, One Piece, Lorcana, and Pokemon) **This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on user feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 7 weeks ago and have started sharing our tool with the smaller TCG communities but we feel that the time has come to share it with the MTG community. **Today, we're opening 200 beta spots specifically for the** r/mtgfinance **community.** **The hook:** We're giving away a $200 MTG booster box (your choice from TCGPlayer) to one lucky member who joins via our link, uploads their collection, and creates a trade list! Get your invite here: [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=mtgfinance](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=mtgfinance) Our marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker will stay free forever. We're in this for the long haul - building the t",

    "text": "So I bought a sandworm... Yeah, there it is one of those LJN sandworms from the 80s. These are rare you hardly ever find one in a box and this one was still new in boxes as you can see, he’s still tied down. When the box arrived, it was open. The glue seams had separated, and when I looked inside, I saw the age spotting on this sandworm I contacted the seller to ask if he happens to know anything about this and he spent an hour and a half threatening me and berating me in messages. I shouldn’t have been surprised, but I kind of was - I mean I’ve come to expect the worst in people, especially in recent years, but this guy was really upset and at one point he said - I will fight a return on this Also, and this is important he didn’t offer a photo in the auction of the worm inside the box. The box clearly was open. He could’ve done so. I felt he might be trying to hide the age spotting, though I didn’t say so, and I didn’t accuse him of that . Well, he had been so rude that I thought I’ll just open a return, so I did and I explained and here’s photos, and I uploaded 10 photos and I selected that the item was damaged on receipt and 10 minutes later, the buyer closed the return and eBay didn’t do anything. I’m assuming I should’ve selected item not as described and that’s why this happened and I doubt that there’s anything I can do at this point, I’m out several hundred dollars if so, - but it is a rare LJN sandworm it’s still tied down in box. The box is still there. There are worse things. This impolite fellow said he’s had this thing since he bought it new in the 90s. As an eBay seller who’s been at it for longer than most I am never rude to a customer in messages. I never argue. I never threaten. I don’t use four letter words. I don’t use 10 letter words because sometimes too many words are hard for people to deal with and I doubt people read very well when I write these messages in the first place. They certainly don’t read descriptions or look at photos very well. ",

(i will post the convo in comments below) i know ebay isn't going to do anything about it so i at least want to warn other collectors because they've already sold 71 of these and not one person has left a review confirming or denying authenticity. good luck out there, and peep the photos of this product listing & our conversation below",

It's a little bit weird as we've seen many of these cards in a Wrestlemania focused release, and there's a mix of excitement for finally getting new product and...a lack of excitement on the design elements - but it's probably worth having an area for information **Checklists**: Topps has an official checklist posted [here ](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0662/9749/5709/files/CheckList_25CCJW_Final.pdf?v=1755631406). There will be stronger presentations of this checklist elsewhere - including[ Beckett](https://www.beckett.com/news/2025-topps-chrome-wwe-x-cactus-jack-wrestling-cards/), [Cardsmiths Breaks](https://cardsmithsbreaks.com/full-checklist/2025-topps-chrome-wwe-cactus-jack/), and [Visual Checklist](http://www.visualchecklist.com) depending on what you need and want. The set includes * 100 Base Cards * 101 distinct autograph cards (across all set designs) * 60 Astroknights Inserts * 60 Famed Phantoms Inserts * 50 Rodeo Rebels Inserts * 40 Festival Fury inserts * 60 Kings of the Night Inserts (Case Hits) * 40 Trance Technicians Inserts (Case Hits) **Odds**: This isn't unusual, but Topps does not have odds out for release day - once they are out they will be posted [here ](https://www.topps.com/pages/odds)as well as added to some of the other checklist sites. **Configuration**: The product is in **hobby box format only** (as far as we know) * 4 cards a pack (though we have seen overstuffed packs) * 20 packs a box * 12 boxes a case **Per Box** Contents include: * 2 Base Card Refractors * 1 Base Card White Refractor * 1 Base Card Red & Black Refractor * 1 Base Card Black & Yellow Refractor * 4 Base Card Numbered Parallels * These parallels include cards numbered to /325, /250, /199, /175, /150, /125, /99, /75, /50, /41, /25, /10, /5, /1 There is no guarantee on inserts , but ",

I was discussing the card with the PSA rep and we were talking about whether it graded as a 10. While he obviously couldn't guarantee anything. He thought the card looked like it could be a 10 because he saw nothing wrong with it after inspecting it closely. I get the card back and it's an eight and the all four corners are damaged. Obviously upset I didn't reach out to PSA but I should have. I recently submitted a jumbo Paul Skenes autographed card and it comes back looking like it was drug through gravel on the top edge with smudges. And then I look at the bottom left corner and the case looks like it was smashed against the ground. The crazy thing is the box didn't look damaged enough to where this could have happened while it was in the box during shipping. WTF PSA... Anyone experience this? I will never get something graded by PSA again! UPDATE: I received an email from a customer care agent at PSA asking me to resubmit my claim under Quality Assurance Request. I originally submitted it under Outbound Sending Loss.",

They gave it to me and it led to a BGS Charizard 8.5 1st edition. Okay checks out right? Oh wait, but then I notice that the sub grades are different than the one in the listing! Look for yourself. 3rd: BGS says THICK STAMP. Listing says THIN. 4th: They were in the UK. I’ve seen other posts of fake cards coming from there. Probably makes getting money back + returns harder. 5th: Listing only had one photo. No back photo. 6th: Sellers past items have never been cards. Last review was from over a year ago. If I was scamming, I would probably buy an old account that has a positive feedback history instead of a new account. Anyone have any thoughts? Are these red flags not valid?",

    "text": "I tracked every penny on 50 card sales. eBay's \"13.25%\" fee is a lie, and it's costing you thousands. Hey everyone, Like many of you, I run a side-hustle flipping sports cards. For months, I've had this nagging feeling that I was working my tail off for profits that just didn't seem to add up. I got fed up with the guesswork, so I ran an experiment. I took a batch of 50 mid-value hockey cards and decided to track *everything*. What I found was grim, but it provides some clarity on why so many of us feel like we're on a hamster wheel. **Part 1: The Time Sink is Real.** Just tracking the raw time to get 50 cards from a sorted box to \"sold and shipped\": * Photography: 2.1 hours * Research & Pricing: 2.5 hours * Listing Creation: 3.3 hours * Packaging & Shipping: 2.9 hours * **Total: Nearly 11 hours of actual work.** That's over 13 minutes of pure labor per card. By day three, I was so burned out on the operational grind I couldn't even look at another card. **Part 2: What I actually paid in fees was 17.6%** This is the part that should make you angry. I took one of my better sales—a **$35 card** where the buyer paid **$5 shipping**—and broke down every single cost: * Started with **$40 gross revenue**. * eBay's Final Value Fee: **-$5.67** (They charge 13.25% on the TOTAL including shipping and tax, which is how the number gets so inflated). * Per-Order Fixed Fee: -$0.30 * Promoted Listing Fee: -$1.07 (Basically mandatory to get seen). * Actual Shipping Cost: -$5.00 * Packaging Materials: -$0.75 After all that, I had **$27.21 left from my \"$35 sale.\"** The advertised 13.25% fee is total BS. My **True Effective Fee Rate** on the revenue I received was **17.6%**. Nearly one in five dollars vanished into a black box of fees. I'm laying this all out because I'm tired of guessing. I'm working on a better way to handle all this, but I wanted to share the raw numbers first. I'm curious if this matches what other high-volume sellers are seeing. How are you guys tracking this st",

Based on whatever card you hit, you can vault it, do an immediate sale which is usually very fair on more “liquid” cards. NO NEED TO MAIL IT TO YOURSELF TO TRY TO SELL IT AND WASTE A LOT OF TIME. immediate sale! if you link your GameStop and psa account, your collection will instantly show up on the psa app and you still get psa offers too! You can sell directly on there too or just list it for auction or buy price on eBay! love how GameStop is modernizing card collections and chases. In my honest opinion, much better odds of hitting decent cards compared to opening packs of Pokémon! PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GIVE IT A TRY! WISH YALL THE BEST OF LUCK!",

    "text": "23 Years on eBay, 100% Feedback — One New Buyer Just Tanked My Score I've been selling on eBay for 23 years with perfect feedback — until now. Recently, I sold an item to a brand-new buyer who registered the same day (my mistake, I know). They left negative feedback claiming the item was broken — but never messaged me, never asked for a refund, nothing. That one review dropped my feedback score from 100% (488 ratings) to 97%. I reached out to eBay and all I’ve gotten are canned responses: * “Make sure your item description is accurate” (it was) * “Respond to the feedback” (I did) * “Message the buyer” (I did — no reply) Here are the questions I’ve asked eBay, and so far haven’t gotten clear answers: 1. **What did eBay do to verify the veracity of buyer’s claim?** 2. **If nothing, does a 1-day-old buyer automatically outweigh a 23-year seller with a perfect record?** ***That's 1 day versus 8,395.*** 3. **What’s stopping this from happening again?** 4. **How does** ***one*** **negative review bring a 488-score down to 97%?** To most buyers, that looks like I've scammed 15 people. 5. **If the item was really broken, why didn’t the buyer request a refund?** I'm not asking for special treatment — just some logic and fairness in the system. Any other longtime sellers experienced something like this?",

    "text": "New collector looking for help! Back when the first chapter came out I bought 2 starter decks and some packs. Didn’t pull anything amazing but still had fun collecting! Then life got real busy and my cards collected dust. Fast forward two years I saw all the cool new sets and want to start collecting again. My goal is to have a mostly complete binder for each set (minus the enchanteds and expensive legendaries and promos). I’ve already placed 2 cheap orders from TCGplayer. One with 60 commons, uncommons, rares from the first chapter to help fill in gaps in my collection and one with 2 d100 cards with nice art! I’ve compared prices between eBay and tcgplayer and it seems buying singles from tcg is much cheaper with a better selection! I know some basic rules like make sure the seller has good reviews and a decent amount of sales. Is there anything else I should know about the website to avoid fakes and get good value? I’m not looking for future resell value but I am trying to not overspend and get the best bang for my buck since I have a lot of catching up to do. I know to not buy sets right at release and wait for the market to settle. I’m familiar with the timing of the sports card market but this is a whole new world lol. The store championship Mirabel enchanted caught my eye since I loved encanto but I’m wondering if $~17 is a good price for it? It seems it’s continued to fall ever since release. With it being a rarely played card will it continue to fall lower and I can get it for $10 in the future? Or with store champs for that set over and all copies being given out will it rise back up? I know things are hard to predict but any guide/tips are appreciated! Thanks so much for reading",

Then in my hunts I started to find rarer pieces, and items that had more of an artistic purpose rather than a utilitarian purpose. So out went the tableware and in went the artistic glass. I've been selling a lot of my uranium glass on ebay and Whatnot. I really enjoy selling it on Whatnot because it gives me the ability to chat with the people purchasing my items (both UV reactive and regular items). So now I've turned it into a legitimate small business. I'd like to invite you all to join me tonight at 6pm Central for my second Whatnot glow show, which I've appropriately named OnlyGlows. There's lots of uranium and cadmium, with some manganese thrown in for good measure. Tonight's show will have many rare and hard to find pieces.

I continuously get people in my chat which are legit vultures, asking to pay $35 for a Luis Angel HFA and a Mookie ultraviolet COMBINED like bruh what? Then get mad at me. I feel like people swoop into my streams because I have low viewers and try to take advantage of me. Anyways I get like 2 or 3 people in my stream, max I’ve had is like 15. I’m about to just switch to eBay but I like the app and the idea of it so I’m looking for a little advice. Thanks Update: I am definitely stepping away from the card game on whatnot. After thinking about it and reading y’all’s comments some of yall are 100% correct it is not a smart business move, unless you are big and have connections. I will just put up one card on eBay and sold it within 5 hours for above what I was trying to get. Thanks guys. Also f*** giveaways and shipping rookie mistake, I’ll stick to buying. Maybe I can be as predatory as all the people who hop in the lobby for a giveaway or ask 1/8 of the value of products.",

    "text": "How I turned a 400$ commercial zero turn to 2,000$ (my 4th mower flip) Picked up this 2007 Yazoo Kees Mid Max commercial zero turn mower after talking the seller down from $750 to $400. It wasn’t some blown-up, hopeless project, the motor already ran fine. The seller just couldn’t keep it mowing because it kept shredding belts (likely from improper routing). When I got it, the mower was dirty and unable to move under its own power. The motor itself ran strong, so I figured it was worth the gamble. I ended up replacing the drive belt and putting on a deck belt, swapped in a new ignition solenoid and 25A fuse (one-time issue I tracked down), added some fuel stabilizer/cleaner to flush out old gas gunk, and eventually had to put on new rear tires after puncturing one while mowing my own yard (previous where already tubed and dry rotted, but did hold air) Total labor was maybe 6 hours spread over a weekend. After cleaning it up and putting about 8 hours of mowing on it myself, I listed it and sold for $2,000 cash in just two weeks. The numbers worked out great: purchase price was $400, total parts and supplies were about $400, so I was all-in for $800. Sold for $2,000, which left me with a $1,200 profit. This was my fourth riding mower flip, and honestly the smoothest. And I’m nowhere near done so expect to see more from this page!",

    "text": "My visa gift card keeps declining even thought it's activated and has 100$ on it I just bought a Visa gift card from target with 100$ cash from self checkout. I checked the mybalance website and it says it's activated but my purchase history says everything is declined. I tried multiple stores including aliexpress ebay Amazon and they all say there was issues with the payment. Im not sure what the problem is. If I have to use it in person that's fine but I'm nervous it's going to decline in-store too. I've called customer service but it's only a bot that answers and no real people. It said something about safety measures being more stricter..? I've used this kind of gift card in the past and it has never had problems. I really don't want my money to be wasted.",

    "text": "Catalogued my grandmother’s collection aka my inheritance - 1,936 Beanies 😵💫 Grams wasn’t messing around. She spent decades amassing this mega-collection of Beanie Babies, ranging from the ultra-rare to run-of-the-mill and everything in between. I never saw a single beanie baby in her home, I don’t know where she was storing them all those years, all I know is that a few years ago I inherited a room-full of plastic bins containing about 2000 (mostly) mint condition beans, and their fate was now intertwined with mine. Beanie Babies have never been a passion of mine, but knowing how much time and research - and money, omg - my grandmother invested into these, I felt I had to do my homework and figure out what I had on my hands here. It took a long time, but I catalogued, photographed, and re-binned each and every one of them and checked price guides and eBay sales to note general price ranges...I know that those aren’t always reliable but it gave me a general sense of what was rare vs common. After cataloguing, I’d say this collection is about 75% standard-issue beans (which I’ll split up into bulk sales and donations) and 20-25% mid-to-high value beans, including a number of authenticated rarities. I’m starting the long, slow process of selling these little bean-dudes (who I have to say, I’ve grown some affection for), but I haven’t gotten past the point of picking out an eBay account name (I went with There Will Be Beans, but BeanRunner2049 was really close). Actually creating all of the listings and managing shipments and everything seems completely overwhelming to me. Also, most of these are being stored at my parents’ place in Florida. I shipped a few hundred of them back to my apartment in California so I could start the process, but even moving through selling this first batch feels like a huge undertaking. We’ll see how it goes! Any recommendations or advice would be appreciated, but mostly I just felt like I needed to share this saga with some folks who might",

    "text": "Damaged Item after Authentication.. eBay suggests an odd solution. Wondering if anyone else has ever experienced this and if it went smoothly. I purchased a trading card for ~$1800. Authentication Guarantee was a part of this. At some point in the process there were some damaging depressions made in the card. These damages were very clearly not there in the seller’s photos, but were present when it was delivered to me. This is a one-of-a-kind card, so there is no possible dubious swapping going on. Ebay has suggested essentially that I relist and sell the card in an auction on the site, and that they would reimburse me for the differences in what I paid and the proceeds from the sale. They will not allow me to just return the card. Has anyone else ever experienced this? It just seems odd to me, and I question whether I can trust eBay to follow through with their side of this. How they’ve treated this so far, I don’t feel confident in their processes. EDIT: upon re-reading their recent message, they’re actually only offering to reimburse me for the fees to resell it. Which is definitely a lose-lose situation for me.",

The motherboard booted games with sound, but would not charge, and both triggers did not function. Turns out it was a failed IPS/mod victim; (pad Q12b had evidence of a wire), and there was a *massive* fail in someone trying to replace the R/L triggers- They ripped the L traces clean off, and lifted/shorted out some legs on the SRAM (!) trying to remove R trigger, so I had to fix all that. The non-charging ended up being F1 blown, which I replaced. I used a spare brand new repro Chinese 101 screen I picked up a few years back from a batch with stuck pixels- and the stuck pixel disappeared after a few minutes of play so it paid off. The repro shell was supposed to be Surf Blue, but it sort of isn’t and feels a bit crappy- oh well. I’ll probably find an OEM one later. - The Starlight Gold (left) is AUS/SE Asia: It arrived booting games, however no sound, no charging, and non-functional R trigger. Turns out it had terrible moisture damage all across the ports and top of the board, and the R trigger was basically fused to the traces. Once I cleaned/repaired the ports and triggers, it charged successfully and sound emerged but almost inaudible- A recap fixed that. The original screen looks perfect, no ‘halo’ at all. The shell I thought I’d have to throw away, since most of the screws were totally rusted down- some are still stuck in it, but I at least got the shell off without breaking it. It’s a rare-ish color so I’m keeping it that way (and am annoyed at the non-matching silver battery cover, have already found and ordered a correct Starlight one). I’m satisfied how the AUS stickers list a production year (2007- my second favorite year). - The Pink Pearl system is another one I basically assembled from spare parts. I bought the motherboard maybe ten years ago for like $15 , to fix my first AGS-001 ; me ten years ago didn’t bother to check to confi",

[[Explore Top Rated larry walker rookie card on Amazon.]](https://blogs.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=larry walker rookie card) ## Key Features Analysis The larry walker rookie cards are available across several different brands and sets from the late 1980s,each with its own unique characteristics and collectibility. **1989 Donruss #33** The 1989 donruss card features a classic design of the era,with walker pictured in his montreal expos uniform. The card quality is typical of donruss from that period, which means there can be centering issues or soft corners sometimes. The card itself is relatively abundant, making it more affordable for many collectors. **1989 Fleer #548** The 1989 fleer card showcases walker in a batting stance. The fleer sets of the late 80s are known for their occasionally poor quality control, especially with print defects.This particular card, while common, can fetch a premium if it's well-centered and free from any markings or damage. **1989 Score #404** The 1989 score card presents walker in an action shot fielding a ball.

Figured I either get a good deal, or worst case get my money back. I buy the item. Tracking provided. All good. Except for tracking it said 2 items were in transit. That raised an alarm as only one item was bought. Anyways item finally “arrives, except it didn’t. I live in a house, and tracking says delivered at front desk. I knew right then and there it was too good to be true. I contact eBay for a refund. They deny it. I appeal it, they deny it again saying seller provided proper documentation... Finally I call eBay and get a hold of an awesome lady who said she has seen this more and more and sellers price stuff under $750, because no signature or picture is required for drop off. I then had to sign a declaration stating I never got this and lying could result in perjury charges... but I finally got my money back. What a nightmare though.",

Its ridiculous that i had to pay $40 more plus shipping for the grade i deserved. Psa, EXPLAIN YOURSELF! Btw if you look at the bottom left silver border on the front of the card youll see a little dot thats there on the card, so you can tell it is the exact same card lol. Maybe that was the reason it got a 5 originally but i cant see a problem that small bringing from a 10 to a 5",

    "text": "TCGPLAYER for Sports Cards!?!? So I'm looking to get some raw ungraded cards of local players around my area(baseball,football,basketball,college teams). So previously I would go on places like eBay or Mercari to get these sports cards. Mind you, these are basic cards, but I was paying like $1-$2 per card depending on the set , player, condition. I feel like I’m over paying for these cards. I was doing the same thing with Pokémon cards ( paying $1/per card—lowest amount you can charge on Mercari ) for cards I later found out were worth .05 . I started learning the prices and would let the mercari sellers know and make them sell me it in bulk with the right pricing. But then I just started buying from TCG directly becus it was easier than having mto haggle with the ppl on Mercari and shipping was usually free after spending $5. I was wondering if there is a sports card site similar to this where they sell cards for diff prices depending on quality as well as way better prices that actually correlate with the market value and not just same made up amount like on eBay and Mercari.",

Yesterday, I receive back the game in an open and used condition. I deduct the appropriate amount in accordance with eBay's policy. Buyer appeals claiming it was damaged in shipping by the carrier. I am glad eBay protected me and refunded them out of their end, however, this seems like bad policy. eBay sellers aren't Gamefly or some other rental service. I am a small seller and can only eat the cost of maybe a couple of these a year (if I can even resell the returned, used items.) eBay will eat these costs to please buyers, but this will usually result in increasing seller fees to make up for it. So we pay for it regardless. My question is, why doesn't eBay hold these buyer's accountable? Are they that desperate to keep scummy buyers?

I thought I missed out on the Beta but just found the invite email. Gave the $25 starter pack a go and pulled a PSA 9 Ivysaur. The instant buyback offer was $25.20 but decided to keep it. Not a valuable card by any means, but I like it. GameStop is selling the card in their PSA graded store for $27.99 ($26.59 for pros). The 'Card Ladder Value' shows $30. [Pricecharting.com](http://Pricecharting.com) shows $34.29. PSA's estimated value, which is found by clicking on the Cert Number link in your vault, is $44.97. Is PSA just inflating the estimated value? Fighting the urge to buy another $25 pack.",

I’m trying to make selling on TCGPlayer a legitimate side hustle so I can make at least some money back on playing this game. My ultimate goal is to make Yugioh at least somewhat of a self sustaining hobby, which means selling bulk instead of just the shiny cards. I just have a few questions on how to actually make that transition. 1. Storage. That’s the biggest one, I need a more effective storage solution for my cards. What do you guys use as effective and concise storage that keeps large amounts of product safe and easy to access? 2. Shipping. What do you guys use to ship larger orders? Bubble mailers or just PWE? Are there any particular products you guys use that are good for sending multiple cards at once? Right now, with my larger orders being only 3 cards, I just send in PWE with a top loader. Also, do you guys tend to use stamps or do you go into the post office and pay for shipping there? 3. Pricing. How do you guys to price the cards and shipping? I know TCGPlayer is all about competitive pricing, so how do you guys price your cards to get buyers interested without losing money?",

Just been digging into Courtyard as a useful comparison with GameStop's new Power Packs/PSA launch. So by way of background, Courtyard (\\[dot\\] io - not sure if I can post a link to it here) is an existing collectibles platform which has been around for from what I can tell just over 7 months. Auctioning a [quarter of a million dollar Charizard](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/12/06/rare-250k-charizard-pokemon-card-going-on-auction-this-friday/) on their platform seems to have been their first big go at publicity from what I can tell and only this week they raised $30 million in a Series A funding round. Here's what they have to say about themselves on a job ad: >Courtyard is the fastest-growing collectibles startup, ever. We are revolutionizing the world of collectibles trading by enabling instant liquidity and delivering a high-velocity, immersive experience. From trading cards to comics, we’re redefining how people discover, collect, and unlock value. >Courtyard is not just another marketplace.

    "text": "my MASSIVE one piece bet. I want to preface this by saying im originally from crypto and over the last few months ive been rolling some profits into TCGs, but more specifically one piece, my strategy has been thus far half sealed product and half grails, now that i have probably finished accumulating, im going to share some rambling thoughts that i have. regarding sealed product ive been dabbling in only the strongest sets, romance dawn, blue and white bottom for obvious reasons being the first set, op05, op09 and prb01, bought a few cases of op11 aswell because its cheap and also has very good cards although i think this ones a slow cook because of how new it is AND bandai have definitely started printing more product then the earlier sets. Since prb02 dropped in japan and we found out there's probably no manga god packs, i even bought more prb01 as i feel it seems pretty obvious to me that lack of manga god packs will make prb01 even more highly sought after. regarding the grails, ive taken the same approach, mostly buying up the high value cards, being op01 manga shanks and some pre errata alt leaders, again first manga ever, card itself is not the best but it has provenance and that is important imo, gear 5 luffy from op05 but also the prb01 version, the oda sig luffy also from op05, this one has insane low available supply online despite a decent population count and very hard to get in english, tcg player prices for oda sig luffy are totally wrong simply because no one is actually selling them so old pricing cant be updated yet, ppl arent stupid and are obviously holding on to this card (everything im talking about is obviously english only, and i only buy graded (i dont dabble in jpy product, too much supply) regarding reprint mangas, for the most part i dont buy them, i stick with originals, however i do make an exception for g5 luffy prb01 reprint because its just such a good/popular card. Now we get to the card i think is the MOST mispriced, gold gol.d.rog",

Identifying the most valuable baseball cards for investment in 2025 requires careful consideration of factors such as rarity, condition, player popularity, and past significance. This article will analyze key cards poised for potential appreciation in value, providing insights for both seasoned collectors and newcomers to the hobby. [[Explore Top Rated most valuable baseball cards on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-section/?kw=most valuable baseball cards) ## Key Features Analysis Several factors contribute to the enduring value and collectibility of specific baseball cards. These include scarcity, condition sensitivity, the historical significance of the player and card issue, and overall market trends. **Rarity and Population Reports** Rarity is paramount in determining a card's value.Cards with extremely low production runs, error variations, or those that have simply survived in limited numbers over time command a premium. Population reports from grading services like PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) and SGC (Sport Guaranty Corporation) provide valuable details on the number of cards graded at each level, offering insights into scarcity and overall condition distribution. Lower population counts, especially for high-grade examples, typically translate to increased value. **Condition Sensitivity and Grading** The condition of a baseball card is arguably the most critically important aspect affecting its value. Even a seemingly minor flaw can drastically reduce a card's worth. Grading services like PSA, SGC, and",

    "text": "The PSA DD You’re Looking For 👀 ##SlabBusters, Push Start Arcade, and the Future of GameStop x PSA: Something Big Is Coming! So GameStop just dropped a new teaser for “Push Start Arcade” in collaboration with PSA. On the surface it looks like a stylish arcade-themed collectible tie-in. But if you’re actually paying attention—like, really paying attention—this is the most intentional signaling we’ve seen from GME yet. Let me walk through what I think they’re telegraphing, why “SlabBusters” isn’t just a meme, and how this may be setting the stage for a full-blown transformation of how physical collectibles are authenticated, traded, and stored—with GameStop sitting dead center in the middle of the slab economy. ⸻ ###First, the Setup We’ve got a neon PSA x GameStop terminal front and center with the phrase “Push Start” above it. There’s a glowing vault aesthetic, “Vault Rules” on the wall, and a character about to interact with the machine. On the wall is a very intentional Ghostbusters parody that says “SlabBusters”—using a stylized bunny inside a red strike-through like the classic logo. And just beneath it, what looks like a movie poster, complete with credits. Not just branding—storytelling. We also see nods to Pokémon, One Piece, basketball culture, and arcade nostalgia all crammed into a single frame. This is a fusion of collectible culture, gaming culture, and retail logistics. Nothing about it feels accidental. ⸻ ###Now, What Is a “SlabBuster”? At face value, a slab is a graded card inside a tamper-proof plastic case. PSA, CGC, Beckett—these are the grading companies that validate a card’s condition and seal it into a “slab,” giving it liquidity, status, and price anchoring in the secondary market. So what does it mean to be a “SlabBuster”? In one sense, it could be a jab at people who crack open slabs to resubmit for regrades or flip into other grading systems. But in this context, it feels like something bigger. Something structural. GameStop isn’t just mocki",

    "text": "Sealed Collecting: Is it dead? This is my personal story of the last 5 years of sealed collecting, investing, and selling. Part 1: Going in hard, and getting in way way to deep. 5 years ago it was the summer of 2020 and I was on vacation sitting in a pool somewhere in Georgia and youtube fed me a video. I had returned to MTG in 2018 with Dominaria and I was still in full excitement mode seeing some of my old cards from the 90s had appreciated in value. The supply chain FOMO of 2020 and 2021 was just setting in when a video on Youtube got me psyched about building a cardboard empire. The guy was wearing a green visor, standing in front of a wipe board and talking about box prices going to the moon. I had done pretty well in the 90s buying sealed boxes of ice age, alliances and mirage cracking packs and selling singles to pay for the hobby. It seemed like sealed was the way to go. My optimistic and incredibly naïve plan: Buy a case of each set, wait the 5 years for it to double, sell half the case and have a free sealed collection. My goal was to spend about $2K per year on draft plus some extraneous stuff like commander decks and bundles, then after 5 years have about $10,000 invested worth $20,000. At the 2x mark I wanted to start selling to achieve a $10,000 set of sealed products for free. 5 years later did it work? Well sort of... Here are some things that have changed: · Specialty sets that cost 2x-3.5x a normal set (I’m looking at you commander masters) · Regular sets skyrocketing in price 50% from $80 to $130 a box · The pace of sets – No more 3x 1 case per year. · The amount of different product lines – collector, set, draft, play, commander decks etc · Universes beyond Needless to say, the idea of just spreading a little bit of money out and waiting became almost infinitely harder. MTG added set and collector boosters? Unsure of which to buy, I bought a case of each. Double masters came out and VIP boxes were $80-90, with draft at $300. I bought some cases o",

    "text": "PSA vs CGC vs BGS (Again?) I know the age old question, “Who should I grade with?” Has been asked time and time again over the years. But I haven’t seen anything recent since PSA is being investigated by the FBI and Beckett’s CEO getting in trouble for something in November of 2024. PSA seems to be wishy washy depending on the graders mood. CGC sounds ridiculously strict. And BGS sounds great if your card is PERFECT. So I basically have it boiled down to going with BGS or PSA. But my worry is their authenticity in grading. I don’t want to send a sure thing to PSA and get a 9 cuz the grader hasn’t gotten laid in months. But I don’t want to send to BGS if they’re gonna screw me over either. Idk I guess I just need help? I really wanna do research before sending my first cards in.",

ATM I am trying to get back into the game with sports cards starting with Panima NBA cards with Prizm and Totally Certified right now and considering using eBay right now. This is my plan: 1. Try to get Hobby boxes sometimes retail packs or boxes every month, not like real expensive.. no more than and less than $200 a month. 2. Trying to buy hobbys or retails without getting whole bunch of extra junk cards. Junk cards I consider are ones that has no real value and just takes up space. 3. Get good ones that I see that has been selling for good prices get PSA graded. 4. Known names that has been playing that sells well in the market with same cards like ones I have now LeBron James, Kevin Durant get them graded, go long term invest.e t then prob sell those in 20 years or after they retire and go to HOF. 5. Keep 2024-25 rookies I have now for long term investment growth in case they stand out within next 5 years., get em PSA graded if their stats meets my standards like All-Star appearances, awards, etc.. 6. Right now try to eBay sell the cards I don't want to keep(like my junk cards), may have to throw in deals like buy one get one free deals, sleeves, cases,, etc.. -This will also be a good way to for me to setup an eBay store, maybe one day turn it into a real LLC online business, who knows.",

    "text": "A Observation on eBay pricing I wasn't going to post this opinion piece, but after further thought I decided to post it. This is merely an observation and nothing more. I fully support every individuals right to list items as they please: price, condition, whatever. Do as you will. I am not upset or disgruntled in the slightest, I just have observed a trend ( this trend has gone on for years). When a given item is listed at a bloated price and a customer decides he will pay that bloated price for the item all sellers of that particular item jump on the bandwagon and mark up prices. It doesn't matter if the item is easy to find and plenty on the market. I was at a local used book store and purchased a copy of The Complete Druids Handbook in excellent condition. I paid 30 USD when taxes were factored in. I looked on eBay to see what the rate was and I wasn't surprised to see countless seller listing this book at 60 + in most cases. Many books to be had, not a rarity at all. The eBay market is a quite a ride. I suppose people just want to get paid. This is one of my shipping inserts for clarification on cost of shipping. The buyer picks up the fee but eBay does have it's seller fees to contend with. https://preview.redd.it/l4e79z7wyocf1.jpg?width=770&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b0a12908950c9bd9b01383357c6a87442dd4be",

    "text": "Dear camera sellers: used means it *works* I can’t take it any more. Dear eBay camera sellers: If you’re selling a film camera on eBay and you don’t know whether it works, *please* stop listing it as “Used” with “READ” in the title. If you list it as “Used,” that means it works. Not “it looks ornamental”, not “it might be but it’s your problem now,” it means it *works*. That’s not an opinion. That’s eBay policy. It doesn’t matter if you buried a disclaimer about how you found it at an estate sale and it looks fine, or you didn’t have film so you couldn’t test it and therefore its buyer beware, if you chose used, you chose to categorize your listing with other *working* cameras. If the shutter doesn’t fire, the meter is dead and affects the exposure, the film advance doesn’t move, or you just didn’t test it because you don’t have film, if I get it and it doesn’t work, that’s not a working camera. That’s a parts camera. Which means. I’ll be shipping it right back as Item Not As Described, because there’s a category for nonfunctional items. It’s called “For parts or not working.” That’s the one you should be using. It doesn’t matter what you write in your disclaimer. It doesn’t matter that you put “READ” in your description. The condition you chose overrides it. You can’t select “Used” and bury “I’m not sure” halfway down the listing. If you don’t want to represent that the camera works, there’s a simple solution: *don’t*. So please. If you don’t know if it works, and you don’t want the item back as INAD, use the “For parts or not working” option. Stop dusting your listings with hopium, and let me filter you out if I don’t want to waste my time and energy on your “it might work” listing. Rant over. On behalf of tired photographers everywhere who just want to use the filters on eBay. ETA: I know there are folks on here who for some reason assume that because these are film cameras that they are vintage listings. They are *not* vintage listings: if they were, they wouldn",

    "text": "PSA Vault Review Pros and Cons !! Hello everyone, I know there was a post a couple months back on getting started using the vault, but I wanted to give my in depth review along with some big pros and cons that you may not be aware of if you arent an active user. I have most of my collection stored there and have been using it pretty much since it started up. Hope this helps some people. The Good: * One of their biggest selling points on the vault is being tax free, since it is located in DE. If you withdrawal early you will still have to pay a fee, but it is negligble compared to the taxes you would pay on high end cards. After 90 days of being vaulted you don't pay this fee. * You can receive cash offers from within their PSA network. Zero fees with immediate payment. The offers can range from laughable lowballs, but occassionaly you might get a really strong one at 90-100% market. For reference I have only accepted two offers this way. From what I understand the \"network\" is mostly businesses trying to obtain inventory, I am guessing they have to pay some sort of subscription/prove they are an actual business to join, but Idk. If someone here is part of it and has more insight would love to know. * You can change listings in real time. This market is changing faster than ever and extremely volatile. If you have sent a consignment with BIN pricing other places, that same price may not hold up by the time it is listed, not an issue with the vault. * You can ship directly from your vault to a private buyer. * For older Certs they will give you the high res scan if one dosent already exist. * Liability is not on you anymore. I know many of yall have sweated watching the tracking of something sent out, Ik I have. * They also provide really convenient data with recent solds, may not always be 100% up to date or accurate approximations of value, but can be helpful as a starting point in figuring out how to price. * The fees are cheaper than selling a card by yourself on ",

    "text": "Your State’s Consumer Protection Laws and Windows 11 Key Refunds # Understanding Your Refund and Replacement Rights for Windows 11 Keys: A State-by-State Guide Purchasing a Windows 11 key online or in-store should be simple. But what happens when the key doesn’t work? Whether the code is invalid, already used, or fails to activate your system, your right to a refund or replacement can vary depending on the laws of your state. This guide breaks down the key consumer protection laws that impact how Windows 11 key disputes are handled—and what you can do if you’re sold a faulty license. --- ## 1. Not All States Offer the Same Protection Each U.S. state has its own consumer protection statutes. While most align with the **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)**, some go further by enforcing **stronger refund or warranty rights**. * **California**: Leads in consumer protection with the **Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act**, which requires all retail products—including software—to carry an implied warranty that they will work as expected. * **New York**: Applies general business law that includes protections for digital goods, with clear mandates for issuing refunds if an item is defective or not delivered. * **Florida, Texas, Illinois**: Follow UCC provisions but require buyers to notify the seller promptly and provide proof of defect before claiming a remedy. * **Delaware and Wyoming**: Offer minimal consumer protection and rely primarily on seller policies or federal law. --- ## 2. What Counts as a Faulty Windows 11 Key? Here are some common activation issues that may qualify as a defect under consumer law: * The key has **already been used** or activated by someone else. * The product is **not as advertised** (e.g., OEM key sold as Retail). * The code is **incompatible** with the user’s hardware or region. * The seller refuses to support or replace the key after failure. In most states, such issues can entitle you to a full refund or a replacement product—**but only if you a",

Even when I do manage to do that, it is either 3 times the price of the deck in shipping, hitting the buy button removes five cards, or if i try to optimize it to decrease shipping, it takes out twenty cards. No shit it's cheaper it's not done. Please help. Update: I was able to work on it and got it to $10 under budged. Would have used cardmarket but it was more expensive and they were missing 5 cards. It was 100 card deck but I'm confused because the confirmation email says: \"Your [TCGplayer.com](http://TCGplayer.com) order of Shadowgrange Archfiend and 82 more items has processed.\" This implies that it cut seventeen cards, but they had a list below and I added the cards up and it reached 100.

I can’t even afford a box to ship the book in now. I’m just giving it away at this point, and I’ll have to go to the dollar store tomorrow and ask if I can take an empty box for free because $1.99 won’t even cover the cost of the box 😭 Why do they include the shipping cost in their transaction fee when 0% of it goes to the seller anyway?",

I now realize that there are two keys to realizing that this is a fake. First, this fake label pretends to be generation 8 label, but the real generation 8 label doesn’t have this PSA logo on the top of the label. This PSA logo is bolder than the real one, and I suspect a scammer made it according to generation 9 label(the PSA logo of generation 9 is bolder than the one from generation 8). Second, generation 8 label doesn’t have this type of holder. As far as I know, PSA began to use this type of holder with generation 10 label. But the holder itself doesn’t look fake. So I think the scammer reused the real holder to make this. As I said above, it took me a lot of knowledge and time to realize this was a fake, so I post it to share with other collectors and want to help them avoid fakes. Thanks for reading.",

I personally won’t be bothered if they don’t because the slab themselves are very high quality and great for collectors! Also what do we think about the CZ Glaraian trio in terms of long holds?

A couple months pass and the grades pop, all except one card A J.J McCarthy Silver Prizm Auto (card #46 on the scan in photo), about a $1k+ card in a 10. Thought not a huge deal shit happens - I get it. I start the process of contacting them to figure out what happened about a month and a half ago, kept getting the workaround “we’ll look into it” after contacting them multiple times. Today they email me a scan of the grade sheet you include with the order that lists all the cards. They’re saying I SCRATCHED OUT THE NAME OF THAT CARD AND WROTE BRYCE YOUNG OVER IT?? Lol. Not even my handwriting. Seems to me someone at PSA either stole my card or fucked up and trying to cover their asses. Anyone ever deal with anything like this? They seem to be refusing to take responsibility even tho the card was clearly scanned in upon arrival.",

    "text": "I want to preface by saying I empathize with those of you who have gotten ripped off on TCGplayer purchases. It’s happened to most of us by now. I am sure all reading this are aware that TCGplayer is very problematic in 2025 and you have a high chance of getting screwed nowadays. Just happened to me too, I ordered a display of 1st edition Yugioh decks and received 2 loose decks instead of 10 shrinkwrapped, a roughly $700 delta between what I paid for and what I received. I am not sure why everyone seems to think this is the place to complain when your TCGplayer purchase goes wrong? Why not the tcgplayer subs or the main magic sub? This sub was much more useful and interesting when it was discussing card and sealed specs, online sales/shipping discussion and strategy, card investments and portfolios, ya know mtg finance stuff. Nowadays its reading like a TCGplayer complaints box and I don’t think it’s very constructive for us to be naming and shaming unscrupulous sellers one at a time, which will achieve approximately nothing, when really the whole platform should be boycotted so they adopt better policies and protections for both sides. Not to mention their seller interface is still basically 90s internet, which is why I haven’t sold there for years. Anyway I love you all fellow mages just want to see the quality of this sub back to what it was, and to stop seeing yall get ripped off, so lets take our business to another platform! Thanks for reading EDIT: I forgot to mention in the original post that the actual data on problematic sellers can be useful if properly organized into a sheet, I made that sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ETZRIbg7_68_W44ozD7MromwudIRucRPpUCwtpOXXI/edit?usp=drivesdk). I suggest we link this on the FF scam posts so we can accrue something meaningful out of these negative experiences.",

    "text": "How I failed my first 3 months in eBay dropshipping (and then turned it around) When I started eBay dropshipping, I wasted a good 3 months doing it completely wrong. I was trying to find the perfect products, spending way too much time researching items, analyzing competition, trying to reverse engineer what other sellers were doing. I maybe had like 50 listings up and I was getting like 1 sale every 3 weeks. Looking back, I realize I was just overcomplicating everything. The turning point for me was when I stopped looking for “winning items” and just focused on volume. Instead of guessing what would sell, I started listing as many items as possible every single day. I use Amazon as my supplier and list the same products on eBay with about a 100 to 105 percent markup. Once I shifted into that mindset, things started to move fast. I went from barely any sales to getting multiple sales per day. And now I’ve got over 10,000 active listings and I’m consistently doing between $1,000 and $3,000 in profit each month. No ads, no complicated setup. Just raw volume. Most people underestimate how powerful that impulse buyer behavior is on eBay. People just scroll, see something they like, and buy it. They’re not checking if it’s cheaper on Amazon or thinking too hard. They just hit buy now. So if you have enough listings live, you’ll naturally catch those eyeballs. I usually list about 100 new items per day. It sounds like a lot but once you get into a rhythm it becomes second nature. I also optimize titles so the listings show up in search, but I keep it super simple. The main mistake I see people make is thinking you need to be clever or find secret products. You don’t. You just need to play the numbers game. That’s what finally worked for me.",

    "text": "UPDATE/PT. 2: Optic Downtown MHJ Automatic PSA Grade thru EBay is complete. Took 12 days (!) total What a roller coaster ride. I DO NOT recommend doing this at all. Probably no surprise to you all, but the difference between the quality in the EBay listing photos & the photo PSA took before grading was pretty significant. I started to worry I would get a bad grade so I’m taking my 9 and running. The silver lining is, albeit for one card, this was fast as hell. 12 days from purchase to completed grading - I imagine the EBay pipeline helped with that. A couple people commented their turnaround time was lighting when they used this, too. PURCHASE MADE: June 8th REACHED PSA: June 16th GRADED & FINALIZED: June 20th Drop any questions I’ll try to answer them here. Likely not selling this card btw, I’m sure there’s better priced PSA 9s than what I’d part with it for after this emotional ordeal.",

Is it correct to assume with Beckett, it should get a 10 with the sub grades of 9/10/10/10, but a PSA 9 because they don’t have sub grades? (The white on the back left middle is dust and not whitening) What do you think my card will get?",

    "text": "EDIT: Was asked by some people to ID the seller so they can block. Tag is: **cabaseball41** Some of you may have seen an initial post about this situation, but it finally came to a conclusion today so I wanted to post about it. I both buy and sell on Ebay, so I know mistakes happen sometimes. This situation is pretty wild though. On Sunday, May 11th 2025, I bought a sports card from a seller. The card in question was a Bowman Draft 2021 - Andrew Painter - Genesis - GNS-12 1/1 Superfractor. PSA Slab is 88537810. Given the hype around this prospect, I expected the auction to skyrocket -- clearly the seller did too, as he had initially listed it a few times over the past year for $1,500. Well, at the end of this auction I came out as the winner...for $206. I was ecstatic & paid immediately. This didn't last though, as a few hours later I get a message from the seller: \"I am so sorry about this, went to print a label and ship your item and realized this was already sent to COMC 2 weeks ago by my partner after cross referencing the lists. I can offer you this same card on COMC for the same price as soon as it gets listed if thats ok?\". For those who aren't aware, COMC is a trading card marketplace & consignment shop. Some sellers will send cards to COMC to have the sales managed by them. Its totally legit (I've bought COMC cards on Ebay before) but the cancellation was odd. See, he immediately cancelled the order (I didn't tell him to), and he chose 'Buyer Requested to Cancel' as the reason. When I noticed this a few days later, I reached out again & he said 'Honest mistake, that's my bad. I'll have it fixed'. I got on a call with support too, and they gave me the following advice: give it a few weeks to see if he truly honors the deal, and if not then leave negative feedback. I thought feedback wasn't an option because he said that I had chosen to cancel, but apparently since I paid right away it opened up the feedback form? Idk, I decided I'd wait it out. Fast forward ",

For... who knows? I feel like I had a fair bit of knowledge on what shops were getting product for a week ago, but that's all very subjective. I can say what any of the shops and online retailer were selling for, because we all know what they were selling for by and large. Today, I showed up at a Best Buy, 5 hours after they opened, and I got all product at MSRP. This included Collector's packs. I wanted to bring up that it's troubling to support my local shop, I need to pay basically 2x more, on an already premium marked up product.

No scratches or dents, its been sleeved since I bought it, and I only took it out to take these pics. Im no expert so maybe someone with more experience grading could help me decide.

I bought into a break for one of those Galaxy Silver packs, which are clearly labeled as multi-sport. The seller opens the pack live and out comes... a Pokémon card. I was totally thrown off because I’d been watching him rip these same packs for a while and every single one had sports cards. I double-checked the manufacturer’s website just to be sure—and sure enough, those Galaxy Silver packs are 100% sports only. No Pokémon, no TCG, just sports. I reached out to the seller and explained the situation, asking for a refund. This morning, I got the classic “refund rejected” message with zero explanation. Fortunately, I reported the issue to Whatnot directly with all the screenshots and video evidence, and they processed a refund quickly. Moral of the story: stay alert and double-check what you're buying. Just because someone seems legit doesn’t mean they are. I’ll be sticking to eBay from now on. Lol.

I understand that there is human error and never expected PSA to be perfect, but I would expect that to be the difference between 9s and 10s in some cases. After receiving the card as a 6 I could not find a single flaw in the card and was baffled, so decided to resubmit out of pure curiosity to see if PSA was actually consistent. Going from a 6 to a 10 does not give me any confidence in PSA anymore.",

    "text": "So I had this interesting situation come up on TCGPlayer recently. I ordered 3 QCSR Emergency Teleport from a seller in April for around $11 each. The expected arrival date came without receiving them, so I messaged seller asking if they had a tracking number (as they should for an order above $30 IMO.) They said they didn’t but offered right off to send me 3 new copies if I still wanted them. I did, so I said that would be fine. Since they offered this right off, I suspected they forgot to send the cards—but whatever. A couple weeks later, still no cards and still no tracking so I opened a case with TCGPlayer before it got too far past the order date where I was able to do so. But I messaged the seller and told them that if the cards ended up still showing up, I would reverse the refund (because I try to be an honest guy). Seller doesn’t respond so I go ahead and just buy another Playset from someone else. Now today (9 days after I opened the case) the cards do arrive—but I see they weren’t post-marked until 2 days AFTER I messaged the seller telling them I would reverse the refund if the cards still arrived. So clearly they finally only sent the cards after I opened the case—so they could force a sale—after they failed to send the cards either of the previous two times they were supposed to. I obviously don’t need the cards anymore. I said I’d reverse the refund—but now I’m just extremely frustrated with how the seller handled this, both by never using a tracking number and by only sending the cards after I opened a case and didn’t need the cards anymore. Would you go ahead and reverse the refund? Would you send the cards back? Negative feedback? Neutral feedback? Some other option? I don’t want my own irritation keep me from being reasonable here.",

    "text": "(Soft Guide/ Discussion) Making repros work for you! Before we get any of the standard \"but...\" comments, this is for a specific set of people, if your not one of them, thats great I still hope you learn something. What You Will Need: 1. GB/GBC Pokemon Repro Cart (Haven't worked with gen 3 yet) The one your looking for usually has a 2017 on the back of the board (seen easiest on crystal) You'll know you have one if the game freezes and the music stops for more then 5 seconds when trying to save. 2. Soldering Iron and the skill to use it (Seriously burns suck) 3. Gameboy Cart Flasher (Tested this method with the GBX and \"Flash Boy\") 4. CR2025/CR1616 Batteries (Tabbed) (Tape and wire if you are working on gen 2, as the 2025 batteries are larger than the board tabs) 5. Rom of the game (Obtained however). What We're Doing: We are trying to remove as much \"jank\" from these as possible to make them more playable and accessible to anyone who either doesn't want to sell a kidney, wants to get a copy of green working, or just wants more copies to trade/hunt on. We will be soldering a battery to the board, and flashing the proper rom, so it will properly use the battery and SRAM (This will work with FRAM too, this is just not the guide for it.) Let's Do It! : 1. Solder the new battery to the board, (For Gen 2 you will need to solder wires and tape down your battery). 2. Clean the board, you never know how dirty the rom and ram chips can get, and pop it into your flasher. 3. Flash your game and test it, save the game and reset to see if it holds, if it did congrats you have a fully working game with much less jank and didn't have to sell a kidney. Questions I Expect To Hear (If this post stays up): 1. Why not just use FRAM? You can I prefer the authentic feel of the original gen 1/2 games with the time limits of the batteries, and have the tools to replace them. If you would prefer FRAM, follow a guide on youtube as your not alone, and people have done it before. 2. How do I m",

    "text": "My nephew stole my Pokémon Cards Recently I've finished my collection of every prime Pokémon card and have been working on my illustration rate collection from SV base- Surging sparks. Both collections have sat in binders in the corner of my room untouched for a month or so. 2 nights ago I decided to admire my prime collection that I worked hard going through eBay auctions and going to multiple card shops trying to collect every card. Upon opening the binder I noticed the center piece (Meganium Prime) was missing . I panicked wondering if it fell or if it slid behind one of my other cards but it was gone . Decided to look through my other binders I had stacked and of course my ceruledge IR , tapu bulu IR and eevee IR promo we're missing aswell. Checked my wifes binder to see if she had cards missing and of course some of her Raikous that she's been collecting have been taken specifically her amazing rare raikou that started her collection. We were heart broken but then it dawned on us that my 11 year old nephew has been secretly coming down stairs in our living space when we leave to go to work . We caught him once cause he thought we weren't home but my wife was there . After telling his mother the situation what exactly was missing and how much the cards were worth she told me he had admitted to them being taken and that he had a handful of cards at school in his desk that belonged to me. I wish the story ended with him returning from school with all the cards he had stolen from us but unfortunately my sister returned home with a stack of cards found in their desk and not a single one of them belonged to me just a bunch of common and uncommon cards worth about 2 dollars. It hurts to know that these cards I spent my money , pulled with friends and had watched on auctions for days be traded away gone forever. I know I can always get them back but I'm so hurt that it even happened in the first place and just wanted to share what is happening and how I'm feeling with ",

    "text": "Why eBay UK's Buyer Protection Fee Might Actually Make Sense Ready to debate Let’s be honest — most of us hate unexpected fees, and eBay’s new “Buyer Protection Fee” in the UK has caught a lot of flak. But playing devil’s advocate for a second... could this actually be a necessary shift? Here’s why this move might make sense: **1. eBay Needs to Cover Costs Without Penalising Casual Sellers** Private selling is now *completely free* on eBay UK (excluding a few categories). That means no final value fees, which used to be around 12.8% + 30p. That’s a *huge* revenue gap for eBay. Rather than scaring off new or occasional sellers with upfront fees, they’ve shifted the burden to the buyer. Yes, it’s sneaky — but from a business model perspective, it makes private listings more appealing and potentially increases stock on the platform. Yes its obvious its not actual free but trust me most people don't have the brain to realise it so ''free'' fees is what gets people listed, especially if they have friends who say use vinted its free to list.. it was just a linear chart for ebay to keep getting less listed. **2. It Aligns With What Competitors Are Already Doing** Vinted does it. Depop does it. Facebook Marketplace leans into buyer-paid shipping and protection fees. eBay is just catching up with modern trends where buyers pay a small fee for more peace of mind. You could argue eBay’s protection (dispute resolution, tracking, seller standards) is actually *more robust* than some of those platforms. **3. Encourages Trust and Safer Transactions** Let’s face it — private sellers can be hit or miss. The Buyer Protection Fee likely subsidises refunds, dispute handling, and support services. That creates a more secure space for buyers to take chances on private listings — especially when those sellers no longer pay to list or sell. In theory, more trust = more purchases = more liquidity on the platform. **4. Allows Better Price Visibility for Sellers** If sellers don’t pay fees, t",

    "text": "eBay stop making us pay fees on your taxes I recently sold a book on eBay for like $12 and charged $4 for shipping. They charged my buyer a tax...ok but then decided to make me pay a fee on that tax? (Money that’s not even mine) so now the fee naturally increases on the money I do get. Ummm I don’t need to report $16 to the IRS. Also I don’t seem to remember paying taxes on used items a few years ago. What gives? Why are we constantly being overcharged for everything and anything 24/7 😩 I don’t really use eBay for this reason. I have another platform that doesn’t charge a tax fee. It’s just harder to sell books on that platform. EDIT: everyone is arguing that everyone is required to pay a sales tax in their state. That’s fine but why am I being charged a 15% fee on THEIR sales tax that is going straight to the government? This just makes the money I make on my item go down more.",

The winning bidder backed out straight after winning, claiming it was a mistake. Then they messaged me offering £200 to buy it directly, including buyer protection, like I was meant to be grateful. Whatever. I relisted it. It ended yesterday at £112. Guess who wins again? Same person. And now they’re perfectly happy to pay. So they win it, cancel, lowball me privately, then come back and win it again for nearly half. What am I supposed to do with that? I don’t care about my seller rating anymore. I feel completely mugged off. Should I just cancel and block them or am I stuck with this?",

    "text": "The trials and tribulations of starting a new set.... I have been very blessed with my acquisitions thus far... really blessed. Money is absolutely a factor and picking and choosing my battles is crucial. It is so interesting how the journey unfolds. When I committed to exclusively obtaining these, I had no idea on pricing, just my intuition and research. What determined a cards price? Is grading really a factor, umm not so much, as sgc, beckett, old gai, and psa \" authentic trading card\" do not have numerical grades. Eye appeal is the determining factor? What about the card itself, under normal circumstances the card is everything, but if theres only 3 - 4 - 5 examples out there its slim pickens. Same with the autograph itself, what did they use to sign? Im not a sharpie fan, the instrument they signed with also adds to the vaIue. ☆ Time in the market. I bought some of these 20 years ago, the prices were very reasonable, I didnt know anything about the nuances of these cards other than I liked the actual signature. Pipgras, Gehringer, Riggs Stephenson, and Babe Ruth to name a few have wonderful autographs. I watched a few ebay auctions and the prices were strong, stronger than I was willing to pay, same with some large auction house offerings. I researched sold lots going back 10 years or so, noticed some HOFers were pretty consistent and others where a huge jump had taken place. The uncle jimmy prices were very strong, but relative bargains on certain rareities the average bidder wouldn't know. Anyhow, I let a few cards get past me that I regret not securing, who knows when that opportunity will come back. Ive been focusing on volume to build the collection, and when that slows down, Ill be picking off the tough ones and it'll be a pleasant surprise as they reveal themselves to the market. These cards are a different animal. Thx for reading.",

    "text": "Legitimate question regarding TAG vs PSA vs CGC, etc... TLDR:; which grading company have you had the best experience with? So I am very close to sending in a good amount of cards, which obviously means I’m about to spend hundreds if not maybe $1000+, and I am torn between who to go with. TAG- I feel like I have seen more negative comments about TAG than positive, but feel like I have a better chance of getting 10’s with them than the rest. PSA- PSA is well, PSA. Still somehow gold standard but super inconsistent and takes forever to get cards graded, none the less returned. CGC- I have had the best experience with them, with a higher ratio of 10’s, including one pristine amongst the 12-15 cards I have sent in to them. I feel most comfortable with them but know that if I ever wanted to resell, their 10 is worth the least I believe. Beckett- I have never submitted with them, but have heard that although they are stricter, if not the strictest, a 10 with them speaks higher than the rest, so most risk for most reward. Missing any other companies, or any other major points that should be considered, please feel free to let me know, as this is a lot of money for me, with potentially a lot of return. And it is very helpful in just general education on grading and the different options that are out there. FINALLY, I do not want the comments to turn into people rooting for one company and badmouthing another, or Tax towards another person because they favor a different company than your I am simply looking for each individuals, personal experience and or any facts that can be provided. This is a community, and a community is helpful, kind, and generous to each other. Not jealous, mean, or hateful. Thank you",

    "text": "Future of grading Newish to the hobby and just started submitting cards (sports cards) for grading. I’ve read and read reviews, opinions, and thoughts on grading, but I figured I’d ask the community. With PSA being the long time go to, it’s almost offensive when you ask a hobby veteran (that has always used PSA) about another grading service. Obviously Beckett has been around for awhile, and the excuse I’ve gotten for them not being good is their slabs are different size than PSA. What is the issue with Beckett? Then you got SGC, which I think their slabs look great with the black border. Then there is TAG. Personally, I think these look phenomenal. With TAG using Ai, which I would think creates more accuracy in the industry, why wouldn’t people support this? Is the real reason people stand by PSA, because they’ve been around the longest, and if the hobby supports someone like TAG who uses more accurate measures for grading, it would make the past 30 years of PSA graded cards essentially worthless. (Not worthless, just adding that for dramatic effect). Either way, the purpose of this is for me, and hopefully other to gain knowledge and read through peoples personal opinions and experiences. Thanks in advance and happy hunting!",

    "text": "Beckett Submission So, let me first start off by saying I did this partially out of emotion due to the ABSOLUTE BS I have received from PSA. All of you talk about pop control and Quality checks this that and the other, let me be the first to tell you that PSA is the biggest culprit of everything under the sun, their motto should be “value is in the eye of the beholder” because whoever handled my cards was either having a bad day or just doesn’t care, they have no standard of grading cards, their grading level system on the website is a lying POS, plus “if the grader believes”... BS my card is what it is, if the graders mad he/she doesnt have said card I can get a Lower grade and never know why, I’ve never had luck with PSA, perfectly centered non damaged cards come back 7-8s... before I continue on that rant.. I decided to go the Beckett route as everyone else imo has ugly slabs and I’m a fan of knowing what my sub grades are... I’ve seen all this fuss and mixed reviews on Beckett within the recent year and it has me nervous as I chose 20-25 day turnaround time and some people are reporting lost cards, 3-4 month time delays on a non 45+ day order, just curious if anyone is in the bad/good area with Beckett !

    "text": "I bought 16 boxes of Innistrad looking for a serialized Edgar. Here are my results (finally finished selling the cards). I got 5 boxes for free due to Amazon points, and I bought 11 boxes, so I paid about... $3,210 on Innistrad Remastered Collector boxes. I've been selling the cards via TCGPlayer, and I offloaded the bulk for $10 at a LGS. Here are my results! This was just a fun experiment, I wanted to chase a serialized Edgar, and see how much of the value I could recoup. Also: I saved a handful of cards for my own commander decks, and I saved a set of foil poster cards for my own collection, so there's probably about \\~$200 in cards that I'm keeping for personal use. Anyhow... * Cost: \\~$3,210 * Bulk card sale: $10 * Rest of cards sold via TCG: \\~$2,140 * Total: $2,150 / $3,210 = 67% So I made about 2/3 of my money back overall. Granted several of the boxes I got for free, so it would have been less if not for that. I did not get a serialized card unfortunately. I ended up buying one later, so yes... it would have been financially smarter for me to just buy the serialized and not bother opening boxes. However: opening boxes was fun so whatever. Fun experiment. Probably will not do it again unless I stumble into some \"fuck you\" money. Thanks for listening to my ted talk.",

    "text": "PSA lost vault card purchased on eBay. Reimbursement offered is under purchase price. EDIT: They are “now” reimbursing full value. TLDR: I bought a rare, low pop slab already in the vault from PSA on eBay for $830. PSA lost it en route to me when I “withdrew” it from the vault the same day. They are now only offering $500 due to comps in the form of a check or credits. Apparently my own comp of $830 is not sufficient. PSA can up charge us all day for card values and what not, yet when it’s time to payout for loss, they’re stingy. My problem with this is the disconnect between eBay and PSA in a short amount of time. I understand the two entities are separate and provide different services, but when they are so heavily advertised as being a seamless experience, it should be handled differently. To preface, I’ve sold AND bought dozens if not now over a hundred items back and forth to the vault and through eBay authentication. I’ve either bought/sold a slab directly in the vault, or had something shipped from the seller/myself to the vault to save on taxes. This is the first time I’ve ever had an issue. I understand that when something is held in the vault for a while, it may rise or diminish based on current comps, but when something was withdrawn from the vault on the same day of purchase from eBay, I think that should be handled differently. Had I purchased something shipped directly from a seller or even in the case of the authenticators, eBay would have reimbursed me the full amount, which I’ve already had happen before. In this case where the sale was initiated on eBay, but the loss was WITH PSA, I am screwed with a comp $330 less than my purchase price, and apparently my own comp is not sufficient.",

I've had problems with impulse buying before however it was always real life shopping in a mall or a store and was about much smaller amounts. I think it's important to mention that I suffer with bpd and currently I'm very lonely and looking for ways to escape the reality full with boredom and loneliness which I think was the main factor to this breakout. Even though I realized the amounts I'm spending and that I'm having a serious problem and I'm trying to control it, I'm still opening the app a few times a day and scrolling looking for anything good. Whenever I see anything I want it takes me less than a minute to go to checkout. What do I do? How do I stop this? I'm not in a dangerous financial situation but at this point I feel stupid and annoyed at myself for this. Is anyone else having the same problem? How do I distract myself?",

    "text": "Micro SD Express Card Guide for Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of storage right out of the box. However, if you own/buy a lot of games and would like to upgrade to a higher capacity of storage, you'll need a **Micro SD Express card.** These are different from normal Micro SD, Micro SDHC, and Micro SDXC cards, denoted by the **EX** on the card. Normal Micro SD card speeds range from [2-312MB/s](https://www.kingston.com/en/blog/personal-storage/memory-card-speed-classes). However, to bring Nintendo Switch 2 somewhat closer in line with speeds that the SSDs that PS5 and Xbox Series consoles use, the system requires the use of high-speed \"Express\" memory. These speeds are upwards of 600-900MB/s. The good news is that your Nintendo Switch 2 games will load faster. Both the system and cartridges for Nintendo Switch 2 utilize the Express technology which have led to the high prices of these cards for publishers and the creation of the \"Game Key Card\" to avoid this extra cost. But overall, new games for the console will load much faster. The bad news: **your old Micro SD cards that you've been using for Nintendo Switch will** ***NOT*** **work on your Nintendo Switch 2 for storing game data**–inserting your current Micro SD card will only show your screenshots and videos, but you cannot play games off of them, be it Switch 1 or Switch 2 games. Micro SD Express cards are relatively new, but you can find some already on the market if you'd like to purchase one for Nintendo Switch 2. The small variation in the speeds of these cards are a miniscule difference and likely won't matter in everday gaming use. ***Note - be careful you buy an \"Express\" card, and not an \"Extreme\" card, as Extreme cards are not Express.*** Again, look for the \"EX\" on the card itself.

I could afford to grade them all, and would have the time to sell them all individually. I was wondering if anyone has any personal experience in doing something like this.

    "text": "I've recently come across many (thousands+) of sports cards from my childhood that my mother had kept. She passed about a year ago. They're in great condition, in books, sleeves, breaks, etc. In just going through some, for example, I have a many good Jordan, Montana, various decent rookie cards, Star Trek, Pokeman, etc. I've looked into getting some of these graded and it seems as though psa is the \"top\" or at least most used service out there. Have any of you used this and how does it work? Do I send my cards to PSA and they grade them and hold them until sold? Is this secure? Does anyone have experience with this? Really curious as in looking at pricing, the grading process can get pretty pricey pretty quick. The payoff can be great, but out of pocket up front can go from $50 to $350 once it gets to them if I have a good card. For the Mods, I have googled and checked on eBay a few times; cannot seem to get a detailed idea of what EXACTLY the process is (definitely may be me). Feel free to remove if you can point me in the right direction with a link or info. \\*\\*Yes, I have an active eBay store as well as some other channels for eCommerce. :) Thanks!!",

    "text": "What I redeemed vs. what I ended up getting I started with the biggest Cardinals card that's ever been made. I bought it on eBay after selling a huge Yankees card from Triple Threads Topps decided they couldn't make the card. 3 of the 10 guys on it have now passed away. It's not unreasonable, but they substituted the first card here without even an email or a question, despite multiple emails saying I did not want a substitution. A Shohei auto /199 die cut. It's dope, but it's not even close to what I wanted, despite it being worth almost the same as what I paid for the redemption originally. I called Topps and spoke with a dude named Jesse. He was floored at the names on my original redemption. He sent a message to the redemption team requesting some Cardinals stuff to make up for failing to produce the card I desired so much, but made no guarantees. Fast forward a week and a half, and I had another shipment coming from Topps. They sent me a Gilded Collection Pujols auto /10 and a sweet Goldy relic /10 from Diamond Icons, I think it's a piece of his elbow guard. Jesse, you're the man. This isn't what I originally wanted but the extra swag you convinced the redemption team to send me softens the blow quite a bit. At least I have a couple sweet PC cards to put in my display case and may end up selling the Shohei to make my money back. Topps sure as hell ain't perfect, but they made this right, and I appreciate it. Hope y'all had a great Easter and enjoy seeing these beastly cards!",

This photo is the exact card that was shown in the eBay listing. Package arrived today and inside is not the same card from the listing, instead it's the card in the second photo (Green). I checked recent comp sales, both cards are valued similarly with the card I was sent (Green) having sold for slightly more. Based on this I guess the mistake isn't a huge one although I'm no expert on all the parallels by any means. Not sure what I should do here.

    "text": "PSA for sellers that like to reuse boxes I've been a buyer and a seller. My account is in time-out now bcause f\\*ck eBay and their Buyer Protection for people that can't read a complete item description. Anyway, this has to do with me being a buyer. Was helping a family friend (senior citizen) with their older digital camera. Researched and the camera only took up to a 512MB card. I didn't have any cards that old but I found an eBay seller that did. Bought the card, and when it was it was delivered (I wasn't home but my wife was) USPS knocked on our door and had her write a check for the balance on shipping. So I get home, and I message the seller. He tells me he used eBay shipping (yes) and I confirmed the label on the box. Asked him why I had to cover part of the shipping when I thought it was all paid up front, and he had no clue. Took the box, contents and all, to my local USPS and as soon as I got to the counter the clerk says Clerk: eBay? Me: Yeah, eBay. I got charged extra and I... Clerk: That's our box. We recognize those anywhere. Me: Looks at box, and the seller had cut a USPS box open and turned it inside-out and taped it together. \"Ok, I see that.\" Clerk: That's a flat rate box. eBay postage didn't cover the whole rate, so you had to pay the balance. So I opened a case with eBay to recover the extra postage because it's not cool to surprise a customer with an extra charge. USPS had written a note on the box label about extra postage being needed, so I uploaded a pic to eBay but also made it very clear I just wanted a partial refund to cover the extra postage. Seller got the notice and messaged me asking me to close the case and said they weren't in the wrong. I message him back explaining that I shouldn't have to bear the cost of surprise postage, and that he should be upfront and honest with shipping and also shouldn't try to take advantage of \"free\" USPS boxes. He didn't agree of course. After some back and forth with eBay and making it very clear I wa",

    "text": "My little story About 9 years ago I got the sudden urge to relive my childhood and hopped on eBay to see what I could find. I wanted to buy an older pack to get that pure dopamine rush of being a kid, ripping open a pack and the beginnings of my gambling addiction (if you know you know) I found 2 Japanese booster packs for $17.52 a piece (now worth around $600 a piece) I said screw it and ordered 2. When they came in, I just sat there for almost a week looking at them thinking what could be in those packs. Do I chance it and open them??? Or do I keep them sealed like an asshole?? No chance. I was sitting on my couch and had my dog (Cowboy) next to me god rest his soul and when I opened the first pack and got the wiff of that 1996 air I instantly knew this was the right move. I sifted through that first pack and when I hit the rare card I saw this and immediately jumped off my couch making caveman noises as loud as humanly possible. My dog started losing his shit in the process (he was happy too 😂) it was literally like hitting a lottery ticket. This was the one we all wanted and I never got to actually find as a kid. From that point on I’ve kept the passion alive and continued to collect. So in a way this card was what got me back into the hobby. I always told myself for years I was going to get it graded so I can keep it preserved forever. A couple months ago I finally had the chance to do that when I saw GameStop was doing PSA submissions and got it back a few days ago. I couldn’t be more happy and this is one I will have forever.",

I was (am?) planning on doing my first BGS sub because I have a card I think could genuinely get a Black Label, and I think it would be cool to get. I was planning to do the 20-day service, which is $35. $5 cheaper than PSA 20-day service. Cool. But wait, after insuring the card and paying return shipping, the order cost $12 more than the same thing would be at PSA? And that is with only $1000 insurance. I realisitcally would want 2000-3000 insurance. With PSA, I could choose the $500 insurance range, and if the final grade pushes it too far over that point, I would just get charged the extra. Much better system. With PSA I can \"undershoot\" the value. If it grades a 10 and goes way up, they just charge the difference. But with Beckett, I cant do that. I have to plan for the most expensive and pay for it, or risk being under-insured on return shipping? And if I pay for the insruance of a 10 or black label, but I get a 9 or 9.5, I am just out a ton of money wasted on insurance. What a joke. Maybe I will check with CGC.",

    "text": "How I pre-grade my cards before submitting. A guideline to getting 9s and 10s more frequently. So there was a request to go into more detail about pre-grading so I thought I would follow up with what I personally do. Im sure there are plenty of other ways people do it. This is my method. First thing is I will create 2 piles of cards that are contenders. I do a brief scan, look for obvious whitening and off centering. 1 pile is cards I think are strong 10s, while the other pile is 9's + I start with centering first and foremost. Its the most obvious to see so I will scan the cards, and the front of the card is more strict than the back, so I look for pretty much 45/55 centering on cards, and if you arent sure, take some time to look through PSA 10 sold listings on ebay. PSA does make occasional mistakes but it will give you an idea for what good centering looks like. The second thing I will do is look at the back, centering on the back is more lenient but the main thing im looking for is whitening. You can still get a PSA 10 with 2 whitening spots if they arent too bad, 1 is still a 10, and none is even better. Than the next thing I look for on both sides of the cards is any dents, dings, any type of damage what so ever. It will automatically drop your card to a 5-7 even if its a tiny ding you can barely notice. It has a HUGE impact on the grade. The next thing I look at is edges, sometimes the cards have bad edges and its hard to tell but when you compare it to other cards you start to notice that some are clearly worse than others. Its hard to tell sometimes since its so thin, but sometimes it seems like entire cards have these micro dents along the edges and it destroys the gradability and is pretty hard to notice. The last thing I look for and I look real close at multiple angles is any surface issues and scratches on the card. Print lines still happen, scratches still happen. Lately ive noticed random scratches on the backs of the cards more than usual. I suspec",

    "text": "A brief outline of grading pokemon cards. When,what, and why to grade. I see a lot of questions being asked about card grading and a lot of bad information and misconceptions. I will spare you guys a whole book and keep it as concise as possible. In the hobby no matter what shop you go to, what card show, what message board you stumble upon, or which youtuber you watch, it seems like having graded cards is essential to participating in the hobby. While grading is quite popular in pokemon due to the hobby being 90% collectors and investors, in other card games that are built more of players, grading is virtually non existent with the exception of a few cases like vintage magic and numbered cards. Pokemon is completely fueled by hype, and has always been since the day the cards came out. We all had Beckett collector and pojo magazines to research the prices of our cards, and since day one its been a very collectible and value driven card game. Grading got popular during the logan paul boom from the poketubers of the time showing how it was a very profitable money making method and it was as simple as buying a raw card from a shop, grading it, and making profit. Obviously as the popularity grew with logan paul and the insane values of the cards like the 20k bulbasaur(/s) everyone decided to start grading cards, which led to the infamous 1 year + bulk turnaround time on PSA. In this day and age in the hobby grading is so well known and so essential that PSA 9's in a very large amount of cases are worth about the same as the raw cards. The price disparity shrunk rapidly as more and more people starting grading for profit to the point where it is right now which is either psa 10 or bust. Now the main reason to grade a card is to 1, authenticate, and 2 maximize the price discovery. Authenticating real cards is important for obvious reasons. Take a 1/1 card like the one ring in magic for example, even if its grades a psa 5, its important to know its authentic and its offici",

    "text": "Pricing: a guide(ish) A fair amount of the questions in this sub are about pricing, and I thought I’d put together a short guide to help newer bookkeepers navigate this aspect of things since pricing can be tricky. The most common piece of feedback I’ve seen given here by experienced bookkeepers is that you don’t have enough information from the client. It’s not enough to know the number of accounts and number of transactions. You need to know the COMPOSITION of those transactions. If a client has 300 transactions, are those 10 invoices via direct ACH deposit and 290 simple expenses via credit card that can be sorted via auto add rules? Or is it a cacophony of 147 invoices in a POS system where fees need to be entered manually or via a clearing account, 16 returns, 4 credit card credits, 34 checks that need to be verified against the bank statement, 8 transfers to PayPal, 10 owner’s draws, 2 random AR in Quickbooks because the POS wasn’t compatible with a few client payments, 6 loan payments split between principal and interest, 8 payroll transactions (4 for wages, 4 for taxes), 2 charges for little Betty’s soccer camp that should’ve been on the client’s personal card instead, 15 purchases of fixed assets (via accrual basis, needing original cost and depreciation sub accounts created for each one, each time a new asset is added to the books), and 47 simple expenses (i.e. monthly software subscription costs, utilities, etc..)? To give the right pricing, you need to ask the right questions. Does the client want to track individual invoices per customer name or are they okay with recording more general bulk sales deposits? Do they want to track by location, by project, by product line (class and location tracking). Do they want receipt tracking? How is your client currently keeping their books? Will you have to transition them into new software or are they already set up? Do they accept USD only or do they accept 14 foreign currencies? Do they sell on just Etsy? Or Ets",

Is it still a good source in 2025? I know to use eBay sold and I've looked at 130point which in my opinion basically searches eBay. I like the magazine vibe and was considering getting a 1 year subscription of it for $45 or so to get a better grasp on card prices. Or should I jsut go in on a online/app web site for accurate pricing? Or is eBay the king now?? Thanks! \\*TYPO - Beckett in title",

From some other reddit posts it seems like these are super hard to sell cuz a lot of sellers reseal them and a lot of buyers would just claim theyre resealed?

Known issues: * Still has trouble matching some cards to the correct one, will have to tinker arround a bit more * Prices are not retrieved live and based on last data ingestion (date is shown on results) Further plans / improvements : * Leverage Ebay api for pricing * Train model to detect slabs and find pricing based on that * Allow editing incorrect detections / matches * Add the option for people to send in images that have false detections to further improve training of AI Model If you want to try it out, feel free: [https://tcgscanner.tech/](https://tcgscanner.tech/) Still improving things, so feedback, ideas, or bug reports are always welcome.

I am a long-time collector of this hobby that recently came back after taking a break when the Sun and Moon era ended, and I despise this hobby. First, I can't even get new product because people keep buying it out and it is so frustrating, because I do NOT want to support scalpers on eBay. I hate prismatic evolutions with every fiber of my being, and I think that this is one of the most overhyped and \"FOMO\" sets in the history of this hobby. I can't go to one card show without these new-gen modern only vendors that started last month shoving eeveelution cards down my throat. No, I DO NOT want to buy your color dog for 2 grand, and I'm sorry I won't sell my cards at 40% because you've \"never heard of a rainbow rare\" and \"it's not expensive enough.\" I want to make up for lost time so badly, but I cannot fathom how people justify that a CARD THAT IS STILL IN PRINT (umbreon ex psa 10) is more expensive than a decently conditioned 1ST EDITION BASE SET CHARIZARD (which is obtainable with some wear on the card). Next, the Pokémon community's social setting has deteriorated as a whole, especially the people that represent this community. A lot of the Youtubers that have been with this community for years have bought into the hype and have turned out to be pieces of shit. Leonhart especially pisses me off, and that \"trade up\" video he posted really rubbed me the wrong way. Whatnot has also gotten much worse (although in my opinion the platform wasn't the greatest) with these giant streamers inflating the prices of singles even more, with their massive toxic fanbases buying into their mindless ramble. I know the Pokémon Company isn't at fault entirely for the scalping of the modern sets, but I wish that they prepared a little bit better for it. A longer waiting period between sets would be welcomed with open arms if they had more time to stock up o",

I won an auction for this card (a little over $100), seller being PSA and the card listed as being in the PSA vault. That was 2 weeks ago. I originally messaged because it had been like 4 days and never moved from paid to shipped, and they responded quickly and just said it has not been shipped but should arrive within the window of time. Now it is well past the window with no update (2 weeks). I have messaged 3 more times over this last week with no response. I opened a case with EBay that the item has not arrived. Funny thing is I won 2 other PSA auctions around the same time and both of those were processed and shipped normally. IDK if there is anything to be done at this point. EBay says they will step in on April 1. I’m guessing this ends with me just getting a refund but I want to know what BS is going on PSA / PSA Vaults end? Like did they lose this persons card and now can’t complete the sale and just went dark? Or does the original owner that had it in the vault have to OK the sale? I left negative feedback but obviously that is no real repercussion for them.",

    "text": "Not going to use names (yet) but I think I just got scammed out of a huge card. Jayden Daniels 9/9 Donruss Elite - Bought a pack on whatnot - It was the JD super rare. ^ - Seller was excited, sleeved it up, wrote my auction # on the protector. - I followed up to see when he was shipping and he said “will be dropped off tom thanks and what a huge hit brother !!!!!” I bought in one of his other shows and that package came first so I followed up again, no reply. Got the package yesterday with no JD, got my other cards and the pack BEFORE my pack that had the JD. Wasn’t aggressive just said “I think there’s a problem. I had the pack with the Jayden Daniels auction #82 ^^ I received my package today and it didn’t have the cards in that pack - I rewatched the video and I was sent the cards in the auction before that one” Followed up again and have sent multiple messages with nothing back. I have all chat messages and the video replay. I bought AND supported his stream before this happened. Looks like I can file a “claim” on whatnot specific to sports cards. This card is potentially hundreds - comps -> one with a scratch went for $375 and a graded one is on eBay for $3000 (prob. high but still) I’m so mad this is what people fear will happen - and I’m so disappointed - any advice/other stories? I’ve bought and sold a lot on whatnot. I get when you’re ripping and especially selling singles it can be tough to get organized. But this is soooo shady.",

I ended up selling a bunch of stuff for only a dollar well under market value, unfortunately. I was wondering if anyone had any tips for getting into it. I also don’t really understand how the profit works considering I only got about $.45 for every dollar sale. Honestly, pretty bummed and deflated. I lost a lot of cool cards for very cheap and I’m not feeling very enthusiastic about this anymore. EDIT: I want to do some wheel spins I have single cards full packs and a few nice chase products... any advice on how to set up the wheel spin or anything?",

I've been seeing that PSA has been handing out 7-9s recently on cards that look like 10s. Other card graders I know with a lot of experience have been getting similar results. Even my most recent submission had a 40% Gem Mint 10 rate. Been thinking about sending to Beckett due to this seemingly sketchy practice from PSA recently. Has anyone else switched to Beckett? Happy with the results? Regrets? Just trying to get insight I may not be aware of. Please let me know, thanks in advance!",

I’ll let the screenshots explain more detail but essentially I had to use a different USPS office because the usual one I use was closed for construction. I went to a different location and sent out three packages that day, they have all had issues. I contacted that office and they explained that they had issues with their system and some of the packages were put on the wrong routes. One of the packages is on the right route but is delayed for some reason. Today the buyer messages me this after being notified that the package would be late. If they left me negative feedback, could I request eBay to remove it based on the fact that I am actively trying to help the issue and that the issue is beyond my control anyways? Thank you!",

    "text": "Value Help a.k.a How much is my card worth? Half the posts I see on the sub at this point are asking what the value of cards are. There’s a few different ways that you can find values online. 1. (130point.com) This site takes data from a bunch of different auctions and various websites all over the Internet. (eBay, goldin, Etc.) you can search by recent sales and a few other parameters. 2. (eBay completed/sold items) more or less the same as the first point it just gives you this information right on the eBay website. 3. (Local card Shops/Shows) Another great way to find out pricing is to go to a local card shop or a card show and see how much things are selling there. The market varies, but since Star Wars is not like sports where players can get hurt, the value rarely drops. 4. (Ask the sub) If every single method above has been used and no similar cards can be found then I think it is appropriate to make a post about it. I completely understand if there’s no similar cards out there, but I see a lot of people asking about cards that can be easily searched online. Cheers! Happy collecting",

After about a hour between 2-3 streams I was pretty much set on never opening the app again. The one that did me in was a streamer selling a 2024 Allen and Ginter base mini Jackson Chourrio and was overly pissed at the chat that it sold for “only” $6. Blatantly lying to the buyer that they “printed money” on overpaying on a base card (last sold for a $1.49 a few days ago on eBay) Not to mention one streamer was adding Wander Franco cards randomly to auctions for no reason.

    "text": "(NOT A DEAL) An attempted guide at buying EVERY Scarlet & Violet set online at retail in 2025 Hey r/PokemonDealsUK ! Firstly, apologies for a post that's not really focused on a good deal. Please forgive me! As we all know, the hobby has grown in popularity significantly over the last few months which has been great to see. We've got more budding collectors and shiny cardboard enthusiasts than we've had for a fair few years in the UK now, but the consequence of this which we've all learned the hard way is that actually finding product to rip and good deals to save money is becoming increasingly difficult. Now over the last few weeks, I've experienced far too many people from brand new collectors to stressed parents complain in public, on this subreddit or over on r/PokemonTCG_UK about how they can't find stock for any set anywhere. So that's basically the inspiration for this post. I imagine most frustrations will understandably be aimed at Prismatic Evolutions, but I figured I'd create this post to highlight how you can buy any set from the Scarlet and Violet era of Pokemon cards. If this post can even help just one person out, then my work is done! Before getting into it, a few potentially pointless things to note: - If you'd like to try your luck in public, your priority stores are places like: Smyths, WHSmith, Waterstones, GAME and HMV. Supermarkets can be good too but stock has dried up a lot from my own personal experience. - I've not checked every single online store, so if you can find even better deals, that's great! - Extending on the above, I've not checked Amazon as their URLs are too long, same for eBay too. But a few sets have Booster Bundle Boxes available. - While the standard retail price of a single pack is £4.29 (not counting special sets), these prices differ for other sealed products like Blisters and Elite Trainer Boxes and the price per pack (PP) is higher. Just chucking this in to be safe. - For a couple of sets, it was basically impossible t",

    "text": "The Starter Decks Are Still Unfocused and the Meta Is Prohibitive So Here's an Update to The 20$ Deck Lists + More Edit: I’m happy to report that there were no Fortisphere or Hiram in the lists so we won’t have to make changes following today’s announcements. Hello Again r/Lorcana , A few months ago I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lorcana/comments/1frup5z/i_got_tired_of_the_starter_decks_being/) about being tired of starter decks providing little value and a very incohesive gameplay experience and it seems to have helped a lot of people. I've since been asked to revisit the decks and doing so in set 6 was... inconclusive. Time constraints and other factors made it hard for me to focus on making the decks I felt like making. So I waited for the prices to stabilize a bit on Archazia's Island and am coming back with 20 decks that can be built for 20$ each. That's right, season 2 of the Inkling Adventures decks is finally here! What's more, each deck will get its own deck tech video in the upcoming weeks on our youtube channel, [InkspilledGlimmers](https://www.youtube.com/@InkspilledGlimmers) and we will be doing a double elimination tournament of 16 of the decks on the channel to provide a lot of gameplay with the decks and answer the balancing questions that people were asking about for the last wave of decks Before jumping into the lists, here's a quick Q&A to avoid answering some of the more common comments / dms from the last thread: **- Will any of these decks beat \\[insert latest meta deck here\\]?** I wouldn't count on it, but the winner of our tournament will face off against some of the meta decks to see how it fares so stay tuned. But with the biggest deck at the time of writing costing over 600USD, I'd say there might be a reason why it won't win consistently against meta decks. **- Are the decks balanced? Which one should I build?** We're releasing a full double elimination tournament starting next week to see the decks in action and will bal",

    "text": "Who’s in the wrong here? (Card show drama) I was at the Dallas card show last weekend, and on the last day, I spotted a card I really wanted for my personal collection. Before I made an offer, I overheard the vendor telling a friend that he hadn’t sold much at all he’d mostly been buying and he was complaining about there being too many flippers and not enough true collectors at the show. The card itself wasn’t super expensive, but it was an RPA of a player most people have forgotten, and I love collecting him. These cards rarely pop up, so despite the vendor being about $130 over the last comp, I still agreed to pay his price. I even offered him a trade, where I’d give him a much more liquid (and more valuable) card in exchange for his, but he valued my card at only half of what it was worth while he was still charging about 75% over comps for his own. Ultimately, I just decided to pay cash outright. We shook hands, and as I started counting out the money, he said, “You know what, seeing how much you want this card, I think I should just keep it.” I was in disbelief. I even tried to pay his full sticker price, which was $15 higher than our agreed amount, but he still refused to sell it. As I was walking away, I said, “I guess that’s why your case is still full.” He got really upset and accused me of taking a cheap shot as I left. I told him he was just being fragile, and he fired back that I was mad I didn’t get my way. I pointed out that we had a deal how was I not getting my way when we’d already agreed on a price? Things got a bit heated, but we ended up just going our separate ways. I just don’t know why you set up at a card show and someone’s offering you way more than you would get on eBay after fees and you still won’t sell a card no one wanted all weekend. Then get mad when someone points out your behavior as a reason as to why you haven’t sold anything. I think the guy needed a wakeup call. I don’t regret anything I said.",

Shipped card next day no problem. Then I get this message saying the age old scam “you sent the wrong card, I only received the base version” I obviously sent the card I had listed as it’s the only one I had like that. I have almost 500’sold with a 100% rating. I’m definitely not trying to do a swap a roo on my customers. So they have started a return for wrong item received. I’m guessing I have to accept the return and then when he sends back the “wrong card” I have to appeal to eBay and play the gamble of will they side with me and this obvious scam? Or am I about to lose $100? First three photos are from buyer and last two are of my listing. Appreciate this sub a bunch!",

Thanks in advance for your help! I’ve read the pricing guide but it still leaves a few questions. First I’ll list what I have. Complete Sets of Series 1,2,3 in both holo and non holo - all blue label Complete Sets of Mewtwo Strikes Back and Pokemon 2000 in both holo and non holo - all blue label Additionally I have (all complete sets): - series 1 holo black label - series 1 and 2 non holo blue label - series 3 holo blue label - non holo pokemon 2000 blue label. My biggest question is that I am wondering how to go about pricing and selling all of this. I’ve checked recently sold on eBay and have comps for some.of it, but not all. I’m also curious if it might make sense to list the entire Blue Label complete set as one item, then list the duplicates and extras on their own. It’s all been in binders, sleeves, cases or sleeves and top loaders since about 2000, most of it is LP-NM, some of it is mint. I added some pictures of some of the pages / top loaders etc for reference. Thanks again for taking the time to read this post :) Also - I have some miscellaneous duplicates and bulk of all these sets, holo and non holo, that I’d be happy to send off to someone if they were able to help me get this all ready to sell!",

    "text": "I have a few slabs in the PSA Vault atm. I see on their website, their consignment fees for selling from their vault to eBay ranges depending on value of the slab. The lowest rate is 7% for a $5000+ sale, and the highest rate is 16% (minimum $5) for an under $100 sale. From what I can tell, the fees for higher cost cards seem very competitive. At least cards that would sell at $1000+. Cheaper than eBay fees, or other 3rd party consignor fees. It's also cheaper than fees on other vault sites like fanatics collect or onlyalt for example. PSA Vault also offers Goldin rates but it seems a lot higher. Under $7500 sale price on Goldin (through PSA Vault) says they take the full buyers premium of 20% from the hammer price. Besides the 7%-16% fee, is there anything else to consider here in terms of fees/costs? Why would anyone want to sell through Goldin over eBay when the fees are higher on Goldin regardless of sales price? I'm assuming Goldin gets a large audience of wealthy bidders maybe?

I wanted to list a working 16TB hard drive, eBay suggested BIN of $11. eeeehhhhh????? Even a non-working 16TB HD is more than $50 so I have no idea why eBay thought this specific brand and model should be sold at $11. I sell LEGO set that I pick up locally at clearance sale and had a couple of 76419 that I picked up for $80 new, they normally go for $170 retail price and a few on eBay for more than $100 used. What did eBay suggest for my 76419, new in box? $22 each!! I really wish I can turn off suggested price permanently because it's using unreliable AI that can't account for condition and/or completeness, and may have grabbed data off someone's replacement firmware chip for the hard drive or a gold colored minifig out of that LEGO set and assumed it represented the whole thing. PS multiple choice listing sucks too. $100 item with $0.99 microfiber cloth makes them show up first when sorted by cheapest. Also keep out of stock listing sucks, they show up weeks and even months as OOS to draw buyer who would think look at seller's other item and end up with a much more expensive item.",

    "text": "Anyone wanting to sell on ebay, please read this With how fast our hobby is growing, this needs to be discussed. Ive had this happen too many times now and i had to make this post to get it off my chest. I just had the 102/108 mega blastoise from evolutions i purchased on ebay come in bent to sh**, totally ruined and creased. No top loader or cardboard used in packaging. Ive been looking for a clean copy of this card for weeks now and this one looked great, ZERO whitening on the back edges or corners. What a shame. This particular seller has over 900 items sold and 99% feedback so even some experienced sellers slip up. Ive been selling cards on ebay for a couple years now and wanted to give some tips for anyone wanting to sell cards online. I feel its really necessary to sell some cards, at least for me, to be able to continue collecting. I remember being intimidated going into it so I hope i can help even just one person out there reading this. Here is what i do, and i know a lot of people have different methods that work as well. This is just what is easiest for me, and what i feel is easiest for the buyer when they have to unpackage it. #Step 1 - Put card in sleeve. Pretty simple, i would go get brand new sleeves if youre wanting to sell a decent amount.(You can get 100 sleeves for $1-2 at your lcs, target, etc)You want your buyers to feel like theyre opening something of quality even down to the sleeve. Old/used sleeves dont look good and can have little specks in it that can actually damage the card in transit, especially in envelopes. The envelopes are run through usps machines that are very thin and can press the card down against any particles and leave damage on the card. #Step 2 - Put card in toploader. Top loaders can be found almost anywhere that sells trading cards. You want the thinnest top loaders possible for pokemon, which is 35 pt. I personally get 100 for $11 online. I also have some 55pt and 100 pt for card lots. Again, i prefer to use brand new ",

    "text": "I bought a perfume from an Ebay seller. It's a counterfeit so I returned it. The seller has now taken $100 off my return because \"it's been used\" I bought a full-size bottle of perfume from an Ebay seller a few weeks ago. Looking back, this was a dumb decision. The seller had about 30,000 sales and a 5 star average review. Still, I should have looked into this more. This was my own dumb mistake that I won't be making again, however... As soon as I received the item I got a bad feeling it was a fake. There was a sticker on the plastic wrap of the box saying it was made in China. When I took off the wrapping, the box was a bit dented and scuffed. The inside of the box was discolored as well. The bottle of perfume was slightly scratched and the cap to the bottle was scuffed up. I gave the seller the benefit of the doubt, though. Maybe this bottle had fallen off some truck and still could be authentic. However, I have a sample of this perfume already and I sprayed this bottle all of 1 time and it smelled nothing like the sample I have. I know this is a fake. It was sold as a new, sealed box authentic item. I immediately requested a refund, which was immediately accepted. The next day I dropped the package off at the post office with all of the materials I received included in the package (plastic wrap, sticker, bubble wrap, etc.) I just received an email saying the seller is only giving me half of my refund ($90 out of a $180 purchase) because \"it wasn't returned in the original condition\" and \"the item was opened used by the buyer\". This seems a little harsh to me considering a) this is a counterfeit item that I could not have known was counterfeit until I opened the box and sprayed the perfume, and b) the only difference between the condition I received it in and the condition I sent it back in was some opened plastic wrap and 1 spray out of a 75mL bottle of fake perfume. I'm wondering if I have any recourse for this. I know I can \"ask Ebay to step in\" by basically su",

If you are Unaware, new to hobby, been around, any and everyone, please do some research before over spending on Cards that are no where worth these inflated prices. Dont be buying cards out of fear of missing out, patience is key, save your money, more always come along. Leave them with their copies, dont allow them to Profit. They will have to Dump them back eventually. Prices will come back down to reality. Now If you are an outsider to all this and are thinking of selling some of these inflated Cards, thinking its worth 5x or so more now, it really isnt.

    "text": "Toxic buyers make me want to quit eBay Sold a collectable statue back in January, buyer paid, I shipped, and I thought everything was cool. Then about 2 weeks after it was delivered buyer opens a claim to return stating it was \"not as described.\" Claimed a \"mold smell\" and a dented box. Ok fine, I'm not going argue. I accepted the return, buyer sent it back, issued a refund, done. I thoroughly inspect the statue to investigate the buyer's claims and surprise, find nothing wrong. Ok, wait a couple weeks and resist it. Sold again package it up and ship it out, delivered no problem. Lo and behold the same buyer bought it the second time around. I didn't realize it until he opens another return claiming the exact same thing. WTF?!? I know there is nothing wrong with it because it was inspected multiple times by multiple people including myself. So what the hell is this guys goal here other than to mess with my listing's and ruin my reputation with eBay. He's a reseller so it's feasible that he's trying to eliminate competition.",

On further review, it looks like both the Chourio and Caglione Auto cards are labeled with the same number: B24-JC. On the Beckett site it looks like the card number for Caglione is supposed to be B24-JCE. So it seems that Topps made an error when numbering the Caglione cards, and SGC labeled the card incorrectly by name but correctly by number. I’m sure SGC will make it right (they always do), but it’s certainly a strange situation.",

    "text": "Opinions on where to set up shop online? I have a shop, website (currently under construction to speed up processes, ease of checkout and better inventory system) as well as an eBay store where I mainly sell basketball cards; but have a little of everything. I decided to open the eBay store 3 years ago to try and widen my audience to help get rid of some basic cards that were taking up too much room, but still selling all my graded cards or even raw cards worth money that had been pulled. So basically a decent balanced selection....I’ve been a Top Seller on eBay since month 3 of my store being opened. I had to upgrade my store within the first year, because I was expanding so quickly with the amount of cards, memorabilia, and sports card products. At this point, I’m still a Top Seller and everything was going smoothly as I have around 1K cards or listings active right now. February marked my first month of not being a Top Seller, but Above Average due to eBay hitting my metrics with stuff like “tracking not uploaded or updated”, “Not shipped on time”, and a refund to a customer who lives outside the US and used a reshipper to get his card via PWE and complained within the first week and then on week two opened an “item not received request”. I’ve contacted eBay about all kinds of issues and it’s just circle talk, they won’t allow you to speak with a supervisor. They just put you off on someone else in the same department and won’t answer any questions or issues as an actual human. They just circle back around again.....so I’m ready to close up shop and set up on a different platform where I can still bulk upload, and hopefully bulk edit. So, ridiculously long story short....if you were going to or have started from scratch on a platform with 1K cards or so, what platform would that be? I’m a member of a lot of platforms, some that are semi-private and the rest wide open to the public. All fine with me. But I hate eBay so much right now and have since around October-",

I try to post it to auction on the PSA App and after it says Sending to Vault, nothing happens. It still says \"Vaulted\" it does not say \"Pending Auction\"... I am getting really irritated with this and am starting to wonder if my card is really in the psa vault at all. I just emailed support but have no idea if theyre going to even help me. Are you able to put your cards on psa ebay auction now?",

I’m planning to visit a card show in June and I saw that the card show has what they call « on site grading » which I assume will be PSA and Beckett since they seems to be sponsoring the event. So here’s my question, how does this work? For PSA exemple, can I have economy service or it’s just premium that they offer on site? Can I just bring my card leave it to them and they send it back according to the service that I paid for? Something more specific for Canadians, since the card show is in Canada, I assume that this could be a really good way to go to save on shipping and custom paperwork? Thank’s!",

    "text": "Grading Fee Question(s) Never knew after all those years as a kid, my son would come across cards that have some worth and should be graded. But I’ve never done any sort of submission to PSA, so here are my questions. Basically, trying to figure out what to pay for cards that are on the borderline of a 9 and a 10 and the PSA fees are much different. One card in particular, the value of a 10 is around $3000. Drops to a 9 and we’re looking at $500. What happens if it’s determined to be a 9 and I paid the fees that valued the card at a 10? Will I get a refund for the difference? And what if I were to go the self assessment route of a 9 grade and it’s determined to be a 10 PSA? I’d be asked to pay the difference (?) which I’d absolutely be willing to do. Is it better to pay more and be safe? Also, there are a bunch of cards that I’d like to get graded, I understand you need to do one submission per card but can all the cards be shipped in a box to PSA? Finally, shipping. Do you take insurance out on the shipping or no?",

No greening, sharp corners, but a little off-center top to bottom. I say \"would\" because I got a call from Fedex today and they said PSA refused delivery because the box had been tampered with. A flap was said to have been opened and retaped. So someone probably swiped the card. I'll find out for sure soon enough as the box is being returned to me.",

When I go to the PSA website the cheapest option available seems to be the $150 express option however I've seen youtubers make off-handed comments about getting cards graded with them for \\~$50-60.

    "text": "PSA GRADING QUESTION (MIS PRINT LABEL) So i bought this card off ebay a couple months back from a reputable seller(sells higher end cards and has sold other sticker auto cards before) and i sent it in to psa to grade but it came back with a PSA Factory Mis-Print Label Do Not Holder Label on the Card Saver i sent it in. The Question i have is why didn't psa grade it is it because its a regular silver prizm with a sticker auto added on and a beckett authenticated sticker on the back? Also Would any other companies grade it such as BGS/SGC? I'm thinking about sending it to BGS and see if they will grade it but wanted to know if anyone has had this happen to them or had any recommendations! *Pics of Silver Prizm Sticker Auto Herbert Card Below - https://gyazo.com/27302c55ec0032c757daf2bbd5332764 *Beckett Authentication - https://gyazo.com/a267419dfe3499a2e8f112e1bd87b2ba",

I know it’s better to buy singles but my ripping addiction won’t let me haha. Question, my friend told me that Fanatics is the new place to put good cards up and I should have taken that route. Is that true? I didn’t know they offered a marketplace etc. Basically he said for any cards worth under 1K put it in eBay and anything over use Fanatics. Or for super exclusive ones, use Goldin.",

Looking into it I guess you don’t have to pay sales tax if you choose to have your slab stored in the PSA vault through eBay. If you plan on re selling the slab, you just keep it in the vault. You don’t have to take new photos. They handle the resell for you.. Seems pretty cool. What are the cons to this besides not actually having your card in hand.",

My only complaint is receiving payment from psa and stripe. Its godawfully slow. I mean like 1970s processing slow. I dont know if its PSA, Stripe, or ebay. My guess its Stripe. But if they dont immediately improve this process. Id be better off auctioning them myself. But other then that I would strongly encourage everyone to utilize this method over selling to PSA, or even vendors.

    "text": "The latest iteration in my “Most Expensive Fusion World” series: here are the most expensive GRADED Fusion World cards as of February 2026. I’ve done away with categorizing cards by set number as that only invited confusion and trolls, so the above represents the totality of Fusion World, including all booster boxes, Energy Markers and both Manga Booster Sets. Set and card number are indicated, as well as grade received (and from which grading company). Under the cards you’ll find the price the card was sold at, which does not include tax or shipping, as well as the sales date. All sales are from eBay. I also note whether the sale was sold at auction, at the listed price, or if a best offer was accepted. In the interest of keeping variety, I’ve included no duplicate cards in the list, (otherwise the list would just be a bunch of FP-001 sold listings ranked by sale price, which might be an separate and interesting future assignment). The only exceptions to this are FB01-139 and FB06-120, which both appear once as a BGS 10 Black Label and then once as a non-black label PSA/BGS 10. I found this to be a good illustration of the difference between a black label and a regular 10 for the same graded card. As always this is for informational purposes only. If it’s not useful or interesting to you, feel free to move on. **I’ve decided I may just start blocking folks who want to constantly rehash the “people like you are ruining the hobby” argument, when all I’m doing is reporting objective price data. That way they won’t ever see my hard work again which they claim is useless information to them in the first place**. But to the rest of you, enjoy, and happy to discuss anything shown here.",

The employee told me there still weren’t any — but then he mentioned the store is apparently closing in about a week and everything is getting transferred to another location. That honestly sounded like a worst-case scenario with my cards already stuck in limbo. So I basically pleaded with him and said I’d just eat the \\~$220 submission cost if he could give me my cards back. I think he realized how messy/unreasonable the situation was because he actually gave me my cards back on the spot — but I didn’t get any refund. I’m relieved to have the cards back, but I’m still out the money. Has anyone dealt with something like this before? Any advice on how I should try to pursue a refund (corporate, district manage, etc.), or am I probably out of luck. I paid in cash so I can’t charge back.",

After the sale, I was informed that I cannot receive the payment unless I have a Stripe account. As far as I understand, Stripe payouts are not available in my country. Why is Stripe the only payout option? It feels outdated and extremely restrictive for international users. If I had known that Stripe was required, I would never have accepted the offer or sold the card in the first place. PSA says this is their policy, but allowing international sellers to complete transactions without a valid payout method makes no sense. This is a serious issue, especially for higher-value cards.

    "text": "Been lurking on this sub for a while and always see people asking how to value their collections. Last month I inherited a shoebox full of my dad's old baseball cards from the 80s and 90s – we're talking hundreds of cards with no idea what's junk and what's gold. I spent hours manually searching eBay sold listings before giving up. Tried a couple apps but the recognition was hit or miss. Then a buddy at my LCS mentioned SnapCard and honestly it's been a game changer for organizing everything. **What I actually like about it:** * **The sports card scanner is stupid fast** – just snap a photo of any baseball card, basketball card, or football card and it identifies it almost instantly. Saved me so much time going through that shoebox. * **Real-time price guide pulls from actual sold data** – not just random asking prices. It aggregates from eBay, Goldin, Heritage Auctions, and PWCC so you're seeing what cards actually sell for. * **The PSA grading estimates are surprisingly accurate** – I was skeptical about the AI grading analysis, but I sent in 5 cards to PSA and the app predicted 4 of them exactly right (missed one by half a grade). Also does Beckett grading and SGC grading estimates if that's your preference. * **Collection manager actually works** – I can finally track my card collection value over time instead of random spreadsheets. **Cards it supports:** Works with pretty much everything I've thrown at it – baseball cards, basketball cards, football cards, hockey cards, even my kid's Pokemon cards and some MTG cards I had lying around. Basically covers sports cards and trading card games. **Not perfect though:** * Vintage cards pre-1970 can be spotty on recognition * Wish there was a web version for bulk scanning * Some of the market trends data could be more detailed **Who it's good for:** If you're a casual collector with a pile of cards you need to sort through, or you want to know if something's worth submitting for grading before paying $30+ per card, it'",

The issue is that auto-pay defaults to shipping the cards to my home. Most of the time I catch it in time and change the option, but sometimes I’m busy in the evening and miss the window before auto-pay triggers, preventing me from selecting the vault option.

    "text": "Been seeing a lot of arguments regarding TAG vs PSA and it always comes around to AI, and how TAG is better because it uses AI. Then come the comments about how it’s not AI, and how garbage it is. Then come the comments about how people sent in PSA 8’s and got PSA 10’s. The list goes on and on. Well here’s my take. TAG: PROS- Unique. Machine learning may be the future of grading and they have built an esthetically pleasing slab, and concept in regard to the 1000 point scale. They want to provide collectors with a new way to collect and they are actively gathering reviews, listen, and working hard to make it better. Turnaround times are short. You pay based on the raw value of the card, and not the post grade value. They value transparency. CONS- Everyone thinks TAG is special because of their “MACHINE LEARNING.” It is NOT artificial intelligence, it is building a massive database of what a 10 is and a what a 9 is. That changes, with every single card scanned. By definition, it isn’t consistent when looking at it over a long period of time. Their slabs are cheap, and break with mild thumb pressure to the center of the slab. They have no vaulting service, and lack the ecosystem to properly track values. Grading is expensive for lower value cards. PSA: PROS- Amazing resell value and massive share of the industry, they ARE and likely will remain the industry standard, regardless of all the haters. Even despite the massive issues regarding the 9s being re-graded into 10s after the customer already accepted the grade 9 payout offers, PSA prices held and there was no noticeable reduction in values. The slabs are durable, yet light. Vaulting service allows seamless selling direct to PSA, or direct to EBAY. Selling from the vault means the buyer on eBay doesn’t pay taxes or shipping (if they send to their vault) and in my experience, this means a better sale price. Better payout percentages through eBay for higher value cards. Grading costs are still reasonable, especially f",

PSA Pros: Most established brand, easier to get a 10. PSA Cons: Reputation damaged due to recent buyback and regrade fiasco; atrocious turnaround times; up-charging on expensive cards that get a 10. Beckett Pros: Higher standards equals higher value on slabs that get a pristine 10; cheaper grading fees; quicker TAT; sub-grades allow for transparency; slabs look better (that's just my opinion). Beckett Cons: the dreaded 9.5 score is very common, and while many 9.5's can cross-grade to PSA 10's, the value isn't the same as a PSA 10.",

    "text": "Whenever someone asks, “How do you ship a sports card valued over $20?” If it’s a card valued over $19.99 or in a slab (or even 1-3 cards in this range), this is how I ship them for maximum protection: 1. Put the card and a Dad Man's Dugout sticker in a team bag. 2. Secure the card between 2 pieces of cardboard for extra stability. 3. Wrap it all with a rubber band to hold everything in place. 4. Include my handwritten thank-you note: I thank the customer for their purchase, ask them to follow my eBay store, Whatnot account, and social media. I also provide 1 or 2 fun facts about the player and ask for their feedback. 5. Place it in a bubble mailer, then nest that inside another bubble mailer for double protection. 6. Add a \"Fragile: Handle with Care\" sticker on the outside. For cards valued under $20, I keep it simpler with a team bag, folded paper case, and painter's tape inside a thank-you card (check my other video for details!). I'll upload more videos soon!

    "text": "I want to sell my old collection of sports cards (basketball, baseball, and football) of around 1000 cards. Honestly I am not familiar with selling sports cards. I am trying to get rid of old stuff, because I am moving to a new place. I am not too familiar with the value of the cards, and I am not familiar with most of the players. I recently found out about PSA Vault, but am still confused on my next steps. I am trying to save time. Should I send the whole collection to PSA Vault and have them take care of everything? Or should I sift through all the cards and sort what I believe to be valuable, then ship those to PSA Vault? And then sell those \"junk\" cards in bulk on eBay? I just want to make sure I am getting the most amount of money from this collection. I looked through the PSA Vault eBay store, and I see that there are some cards of not-so-famous players selling for a $20+ per card. Please go easy on this ignorant fella, just trying to get rid of old items, thank you LOL. Edit: This collection is from 20+ years ago. All raw cards, no graded. Cards from 80s, 90s, and early 2000s. I stopped collecting around 2002, and it since has been sitting in my closet.",

    "text": "Hey everyone, I’ve got a question and would love some opinions from those with grading experience. Question: Should I crack and resend, or resend for review? For context — I’ve been submitting cards for grading for a while and I’m pretty strict about what I send in. My pre-grading standards are tough, and so far I’ve had about a 92% PSA 10 rate out of 103 total cards I’ve submitted. I know that’s not a massive number for some, but I’d say I’m fairly confident in my eye for grading. Recently, I sent in the card as shown in the pictures. The grader notes mentioned a dent along the right side (no specification if it was on the front or back). After checking it myself, showing it to a few friends and vendors who grade regularly, and even having Beckett take a look — everyone agreed there’s no dent at all. I even checked it under a blacklight and found nothing. I’ve helped friends crack and resend cards before, but I’ve never personally done a review submission — where you send in the slab as-is for PSA to reassess it. So... what would you do? Crack and resend, or send for review? Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with similar situations.",

But my worry is their authenticity in grading. I don’t want to send a sure thing to PSA and get a 9 cuz the grader hasn’t gotten laid in months.

    "text": "BEST VALUE OUT THERE! 2025 STADIUM CLUB MEGA BOXES! NEW RELEASE! Hey everybody, welcome back to the brand new release preview video. Today we've got Stadium Club for you. And I was really shocked and amazed when I went to bring in my cases today of these mega boxes. I about hurt my back picking up. It was so heavy. I was like, \"What? Why are these mega box cases so heavy?\" Usually like for Bowman Draft Megas, the Chrome update megas, Chrome Megas, like those things are super light because there's only 32 cards per box. I expected that with this. I couldn't believe how heavy it was. Do you know how many cards in a mega box of Stadium Club? There's more than a hobby box. There are 144 cards in these mega boxes, which is absolutely almost unthinkable to me. It's crazy. So, before we go into this, we're going to cover the mega box video today. We'll do the hobby box tomorrow and I don't know, maybe we'll do the blasters on Friday. But take a look at this price breakdown here. So, we have the mega boxes. They're the MSRP is 50 bucks on those, but the number of cards is 144 cards. Stadium Club is known for its quality, the great photography, the glossy cards and everything. And I just can't believe that they're giving you that many cards in that more than a hobby box. So take a look. It's 35 cents per card with the megas. The hobby box, which MSRP at 129, by the way, they're selling for $200 a piece online. So Dave and Adam, Steel City, blow, they're all $200 a piece there today, which is just crazy to me, which is what would that work out to be like a $1.75 a card or something like that. Somewhere in that vicinity. And you only get one autograph. So why are we paying so much more per card? Why are we paying just MSRP? $80 more for one auto. I don't know. I guess we'll find out when we rip open those hobby boxes tomorrow. And then the blaster boxes is just another way to flush money down the drain. It's just not very good. Only 40 cards in a blaster box, 62 cents a card. ",

Just be patient! Patience pays off.",

These things are crazy to look at. They tell such a story about the sports card market. So, we're going into the Arena Club studio. And let's get started. Look at this. Wow. Okay. So, right off the bat, we've got Drake May verse Jaden Daniels. And look at how they have separated themselves. That's Drake May, the light blue line. Wow. So about a month into the football season this year, Drake May for the first time ever passed Jaden Daniels and then [music] Drake May's cards went to the moon, Jaden Daniels cards continued to go down and down and down and look at the separation between Drake May and Jaden Daniels. That is unbelievable. Now here's the big question. Is this going to hold up next season? Will Drake May be that high and Jaden Daniels that low? or will things start to reverse themselves again? What do you think? Hey, let's not forget though about the veteran quarterbacks or the Hall of Famers that have already done this. Dan Marino, Joe Montana, John Elway, their rookie cars. Now, that has been a real investment over the course of the last 5 years. Look at those ones and how they've gone up. Particularly John Elway. [music] Gosh, his stuff has been so hot recently. Great to see these old guys still getting the love. Oh man, two guys not getting the love at all. Zion Williamson and Jaw Morant. Look at the complete collapse of their rookie cards. Both of these guys were so hyped when they came into the NBA in 2019. People were buying their cards like crazy. These are their Prism base cards. They almost hit $900, but look at where they are today. They're around $20 in a PSA 10. It has been an unbelievable fall from grace for both of these [music] guys. Oh, this graph, this is hard to look at. My goodness. Now, this one's interesting. Wendy, is he going to go the route of Zion and Jaw or is he going to rally b",

    "text": "SUNDAY NIGHT LIVE BREAKS! (Whatnot simulcast) Sail across Hey everybody, welcome back to another brand new Sunday night stream. I hope everybody's having a very pleasant Sunday. And it's a long weekend for some of us. I don't have to go to work tomorrow. It's President's Day, so we're off. So, really no restriction on how long I can go tonight. Usually on a Sunday night, I'll probably wrap up shop around 11:00 or so, but we can go as long as you guys want to. So, thank you very much for joining us. We got a Walmart video that is currently being uploaded. I think it is uploaded, but it's not um processed up to 4K yet. Probably another hour for that to happen. So, if you are wondering where tonight's YouTube video is, I was waiting on it, but looks like it's going to take a little bit longer, but uh no problem there. We'll get it upload here around 7:00 or so. So, thanks for joining us. We're going to start off with some museum collection tonight. I see Knucks just grabbed some spots in this round, which is almost sold out. It also comes with series 1, 2026 Topps series 1, a hobby box of that. We got that case sitting over here. We've hopefully we can continue to find some good stuff out of the brand new release. And it also comes with a Bowman Draft Mega Box along with the jersey. So, all of our pick your team rounds pretty much all come with jerseys. I think they all do. So, we have plenty of those to give away tonight. We also have free packs of cards we'll be giving away left and right. We'll start one of those up here in a second. And I just had to go grab my bow and draft megas. It's a little bit of a labyrinth to get over to the other side of this office, even though it's a kind of a small office. Got to like weave around. Chris just picked up a spot. Padres's in black and white. Thank you very much. All right. Well, here's a free pack of cards. Wh Never mind. I didn't load all the free packs of cards in. Let me do that real quick for you so you can get a freeb",

The parallels from Egg simply don’t command much value, while the Hangers parallels are both visually impressive and highly desirable. Based on what I’ve seen and opened so far, Hangers also appear to be significantly more loaded with quality hits. Given that combination of strong parallels and consistent value, I wouldn’t be surprised if Hangers become harder to find in the near future.",

    "text": "BLASTERS ARE BAD THIS YEAR?! INCREASED PRICES, LITTLE YIELD. Hey everybody, welcome back to another brand new release preview video. Today we're taking a look at the last boxes. We already covered the jumbo boxes and the hobby boxes and they were pretty good. Can't say that there's much of a anything to talk about negatively about them except the fact that the jumbo boxes got rid of one of your hits. Hobby box have been great. Now we're looking at blasters and I'm not so sure before I even rip any of these how I feel about these blasters. First of all, they went up in price. You don't realize it, but they went up in price. Let's talk about how. Boxes from 2025, they were $25 a piece. Boxes from 2026 are also $25 a piece. Except the big difference here is used to get 84 cards in last year's blaster boxes. Now you only get 72. So, they have taken a pack out. A complete pack is gone. Instead of seven packs per box at 12 cards each, you now get six. So, what does that mean for your price? Well, I do the math. Last year, you got 84 cards at $24.99. That's 29.75 cents a card. This year, the price is still the same for the box, but at 72 cards, you're paying 34.7 cents per card, which is the equivalent of paying the price of $29.15 per box. All you do is take that 34.7, multiply it by 84 cards, and that's what you know, that's what the price increase is gone to. So, basically, it's almost like buying the S last year's box for 29 bucks. So, big price increase on these blasters by $4 to $5. And are they going to be worth it? Well, I don't know. We'll go ahead and check it out right now because you've seen these out at Walmart. You've seen them at Target. You've seen them out there. And you might wonder, should I spend some money on this? Should I maybe buy like, I don't know, four blasters, or should I go buy a hobby box? Let's find out. We're going to open up 10 of these blasters in this video. We're going to start with this one right here. This is for Keith. Good luck, Kei",
