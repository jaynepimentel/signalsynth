The user might be implying that the platform lacks certain features or rules that enhance the user experience for casual players.",

      "1. Engage with the User: The first step should be to engage with the user to understand the specific rule or feature they are referring to. This could be done through a direct message or a comment asking for more details.",
      "2. User Research: Conduct user research to understand the needs and preferences of casual players. This could involve surveys, interviews, or focus groups. The goal is to identify features or rules that could improve the user experience for this segment.",
      "3. Feature Development: Based on the feedback from the user and the insights from the user research, develop new features or rules that cater to the needs of casual players. This could involve changes to the platform's interface, the introduction of new game modes, or the modification of existing rules.",
      "4. User Testing: Before rolling out the new features or rules to all users, conduct user testing with a small group of casual players. This will allow the platform to gather feedback and make any necessary adjustments.",
      "5. Communication: Once the new features or rules are ready to be rolled out, communicate these changes to the users. This could involve an announcement on the platform, an email to users,"

This would allow them to share tips, rules, and experiences with each other. This could build trust and reduce friction as users can interact with others who have similar interests.",
