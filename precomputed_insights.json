      "2. Enhance Seller Verification Process: Strengthen the seller verification process to ensure only legitimate sellers can list items on the platform. This could involve a more rigorous approval process, including identity verification and proof of product ownership. This would increase trust among buyers, leading to higher conversion rates.",
      "3. Implement a Secure Payment Escrow System: Introduce a secure payment escrow system where funds are held until the buyer confirms receipt of the purchased item in the promised condition. This would reduce the risk for buyers and increase their confidence in making purchases, thus reducing friction and boosting conversion rates."

This would not only increase trust among buyers but also deter sellers from listing counterfeit items. If a buyer receives a counterfeit item, they should be able to get a full refund without having to return the item.",
      "3. Introduce a rating system for product authenticity: eBay could implement a rating system where buyers can rate the authenticity of the products they purchase. This would help future buyers make informed decisions and increase overall trust in the marketplace. Sellers with low authenticity ratings could be flagged for review or removed from the platform."

This system could take into account factors such as the accuracy of product descriptions, the seller's return policy, and their shipping speed. This would give buyers more confidence in their purchases, potentially increasing conversion rates."

If a piece is found to be inauthentic, the buyer would be entitled to a refund. This would reduce friction in the buying process and encourage more users to purchase artwork on the platform."

To reduce friction, eBay could improve the design and functionality of the threaded format. This could involve making it easier to follow conversations, adding a feature to highlight or pin important posts, and ensuring the format is user-friendly and intuitive."

      "1. Implement a Verified Seller Program: To increase trust among users, eBay could introduce a verified seller program specifically for high-end brands like Tiffany & Co. This program would require sellers to provide proof of authenticity for their products, which would then be verified by a team of experts. Once approved, these sellers would receive a 'Verified Seller' badge on their profile, assuring buyers of the product's authenticity.",
      "2. Enhanced Product Visualization: To improve conversion rates, eBay could enhance its product visualization features. For collectibles and art pieces, detailed and high-resolution images are crucial. eBay could introduce a 360-degree view feature or augmented reality (AR) technology that allows users to virtually place the item in their space. This would provide a better understanding of the product and could lead to higher conversion rates.",
      "3. Streamline Return Process: To reduce friction, eBay could simplify the return process for high-value items like Tiffany & Co. products. This could include a step-by-step guide on how to securely package and return the item, a pre-paid return shipping label, and a guarantee that the buyer will receive a full refund if the item is not as described. This would make the return process less daunting and increase buyer confidence."
