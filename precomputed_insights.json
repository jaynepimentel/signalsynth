I bought a item on eBay and after its being sent around multiple mail offices it was marked on Royal Mail as returning to sender I contacted the seller and they had suggested once it was returned to them they would post it back out. A week went by and it hadn t updated, I asked the seller for any updates on his side and I got no response. So I opened up a claim on eBay and after 2 days they refunded me and I still hadn t heard anything for the seller. Another few days went by and I got a notification on the Royal Mail app saying the item was out for delivery again, strange as it was supposed to be returning to sender but again nothing came through the post. After another few days I went into the delivery office and they went to check if they could find it and nothing again. Later that day I got a notification that it was ready to be collected, so I went back the next day and they realised the address was wrong so that s why they couldn t deliver it to me, so I managed to collect the item and it was marked on the Royal Mail app as collected and on eBay that I had collected it. My question is really what do I do now? Is the seller out of pocket? Why haven t they reached out to me. It s so strange, it s obviously handy getting something for free but I feel guilty if the seller is out of pocket. Just so weird that they haven t reached out and asked if I collected it?",

How is this even legal for them to automatically give the money back without giving me a chance to inspect they put the device back together properly!?!? Edit: I may add it’s been 3 days since eBay made their case decision but the buyer hasn’t shipped it back. Is there a time threshold where the case automatically closes? Update: Got the camera back and no matter how many times I tell them that the camera has been opened and that I can’t possibly give them a full refund, they don’t care. \nAbsolutely ridiculous\nAND they kept the 500$ selling fee so now not only do I have to give back the 2500$ payout but I need to somehow come up with 500$ to pay eBay or else they send it to collections. \nHow is this even legal? They basically want me to pay them 500$ to F me",

      "1. Implement a mandatory seller inspection window before refund issuance: After the buyer returns an item, require the seller to confirm the item’s condition within a set timeframe (e.g., 3 days) before any refund is processed. This ensures sellers can verify the item’s state and dispute improper returns, reducing automatic refunds without seller input.",
      "2. Introduce a transparent, step-by-step return dispute dashboard: Provide sellers with a clear interface showing return request status, buyer communications, evidence submitted (photos, messages), and timelines for each step. This increases transparency, helps sellers track cases, and reduces frustration from unclear or automatic decisions.",
      "3. Add a “return condition verification” feature requiring photo/video proof from buyers before return approval: Require buyers to upload detailed images or videos of the item’s condition before shipping it back, especially for high-value or fragile items. This helps sellers assess potential damage upfront and supports fair dispute resolution, improving trust on both sides."

This will eliminate confusion and build trust by making fees fully transparent and easy to understand.",

Here s the situation: I shipped the item with PostNord, and tracking clearly shows that the package is available for pickup at a parcel shop in Germany. The buyer insisted on home delivery ( Lieferung frei Haus ), even though I never stated that in the listing. Delivery to parcel shops is completely standard in Germany with PostNord/DPD. To keep things smooth, I even sent the buyer 10 as goodwill compensation earlier in the process. The buyer refused to pick up the parcel, opened an eBay case, and I provided the tracking link. eBay still decided in favor of the buyer, stating that I didn t provide sufficient tracking information. The refund was issued to the buyer. I ve appealed the decision, but honestly, I don t understand what I did wrong here. From my perspective, I: 1. Shipped on time. 2. Provided tracking. 3. Proved the parcel is available for pickup. The buyer simply refused to collect it. My questions: What exactly counts as sufficient tracking in eBay s eyes? Do I need to provide the tracking number in a very specific format, or does PostNord not count as a valid carrier for eBay.de? Has anyone else experienced similar issues with parcels being marked as ready for pickup instead of delivered, and eBay siding with the buyer? Are there ways to better protect myself in the future when shipping from Denmark to Germany?

I’ve appealed the decision, but honestly, I don’t understand what I did wrong here. From my perspective, I:\n    1.  Shipped on time.\n    2.  Provided tracking.\n    3.  Proved the parcel is available for pickup. The buyer simply refused to collect it. My questions:\n    • What exactly counts as “sufficient tracking” in eBay’s eyes? Do I need to provide the tracking number in a very specific format, or does PostNord not count as a valid carrier for eBay.de?\n    • Has anyone else experienced similar issues with parcels being marked as “ready for pickup” instead of “delivered,” and eBay siding with the buyer?\n    • Are there ways to better protect myself in the future when shipping from Denmark to Germany? It feels really unfair that a buyer can refuse to pick up their parcel, claim “non-delivery,” and still get refunded. Any advice or insights would be appreciated.",

    "ideas": [
      "1. **Enhanced Tracking Validation & Display:** Integrate carrier APIs (including PostNord and other regional carriers) to automatically verify and display detailed, real-time parcel status (e.g., “Ready for pickup at parcel shop”) in the order and case management system. This ensures both buyers and eBay support clearly see valid proof of shipment and delivery status beyond just “in transit” or “delivered,” reducing disputes based on ambiguous tracking.",
      "2. **Clear Shipping & Delivery Expectations in Listings:** Add a mandatory, standardized shipping options and delivery method selector for sellers listing items cross-border, with explicit buyer acknowledgment (e.g., “Delivery to parcel shop standard in destination country”). This transparency helps set correct buyer expectations upfront and can be referenced in case decisions, protecting sellers from disputes due to differing delivery norms.",
      "3. **Seller Protection Policy Update & Education:** Update seller protection policies to explicitly cover cases where valid tracking shows parcel is available for pickup but buyer refuses collection, clarifying seller responsibilities and buyer obligations. Complement this with in-app guidance and post-sale notifications to sellers about best practices for international shipping and dispute documentation, empowering sellers to better protect themselves."

This transparency will build trust by clarifying enforcement and reducing frustration over inconsistent removals.",
      "2. **Enhance AI Moderation with Continuous Human-in-the-Loop Training:** Develop a feedback loop where human reviewers’ decisions on reported listings are used to retrain and improve the AI detection models regularly. This will reduce false negatives and inconsistencies, ensuring more uniform enforcement of policies and increasing seller confidence in the reporting system.",
      "3. **Introduce a Seller Appeal and Escalation Process with SLA:** Provide a clear, easy-to-use appeal mechanism for sellers to challenge removals, with guaranteed response times and escalation paths to senior moderators. This ensures fairness, reduces seller anxiety about arbitrary removals, and demonstrates eBay’s commitment to consistent, fair policy enforcement."

I m slightly worried that after receiving so many refunds in a small period that I may look dodgy, especially not having to return the item. Has anyone else experienced this?

However after buying I immediately had buyer s remorse since 1 the card wasn t in the best condition (I can t even afford this card in good condition- I bought a graded 2 as that is all I could afford) and 2 this will sting me financially for like 2 months. I cancelled about an hour later but despite me requesting direct shipping and not PSA Vault of the way of transferring the card, the card is still in my PSA Vault . The cancellation is still pending. I have a feeling this is due to me purchasing directly from a company s Ebay account, they may be off this holiday weekend. The card never shipped and no shipping label was printed. Can I even get a refund for this though? Thanks. It was an emotionally driven impulse purchase I immediately regretted.",

      "1. Implement a Verified Ownership Dispute Resolution Flow: Allow users to submit proof of ownership (e.g., certification paperwork) directly through a dedicated dispute form that triggers a prioritized review by eBay’s trust & safety team, with clear status updates and guaranteed response times (e.g., within 7 days). This will reduce seller fraud and improve trust for high-value collectibles.",
      "2. Introduce a Certified Item Lock Feature: When a user submits valid certification documents for a unique collectible (like a PSA graded card), temporarily lock or flag any other listings with the same certification number until eBay verifies the authenticity and ownership claims. This prevents duplicate fraudulent listings and protects legitimate sellers.",
      "3. Enhance Seller Communication & Transparency: Add an in-app messaging prompt that encourages sellers to update or remove listings when ownership changes are detected or reported. Also, provide buyers and sellers with automated notifications about the status of reported listings, so users feel heard and see progress, improving trust and conversion."

This reduces fake signatures and provides buyers with concrete proof of delivery, increasing trust and enabling faster dispute resolution.",
      "2. **Introduce a Buyer Protection Escrow for Third-Party Services:** When transactions involve third-party services (like grading by PSA), hold the payment in escrow until the buyer confirms receipt of the final item. This protects buyers from losing money if the final shipment is lost or mishandled, improving buyer confidence in complex transactions.",
      "3. **Create a Transparent Multi-Party Shipping Chain Tracker:** Develop a feature that tracks and displays each handoff in the shipping chain (seller → grading service → final shipment) with timestamps and responsible party info. This transparency helps clarify liability in case of issues and reassures buyers about the process, boosting conversion on items requiring additional services."

On top of that eBay is also throwing random 10-15% off type price reductions, looks to be just for Japanese luxury items. At the same time eBay is adding a $2.5k extra cost for anything around $5k from Japan going first to the eBay authentication center since eBay gets charged for the orange man s madness as the first entry to US. Anything skipping that center is at the hands of DHL and UPS and who knows what that bill is going to be or if they will even deliver the box.

    "raw_text": "my subreddits\nI see some really good deals. Used watches are always cheaper from Japan. But now even cheaper in listing prices from Japanese shops desperate to sell. On top of that eBay is also throwing random 10-15% off type price reductions, looks to be just for Japanese luxury items. At the same time eBay is adding a $2.5k extra cost for anything around $5k from Japan going first to the eBay authentication center since eBay gets charged for the orange man’s madness as the first entry to US. Anything skipping that center is at the hands of DHL and UPS and who knows what that bill is going to be or if they will even deliver the box.

This reduces buyer uncertainty and builds trust by preventing surprise fees at checkout.",

Highlight these sellers to increase buyer confidence and conversion for cross-border purchases.",

Provide buyers with real-time status updates and a dedicated support channel to resolve delivery or fee disputes quickly, improving trust and reducing purchase hesitation."

This reassures sellers about the process and reduces anxiety around overseas shipments.",
      "2. **Guaranteed Seller Protection Badge:** Introduce a visible badge on listings enrolled in eBay’s international shipping and insurance program that guarantees zero liability for lost or damaged items once the package reaches the eBay distribution center. Include a simple FAQ and claim process link directly on the listing page to boost seller confidence.",
      "3. **Pre-Listing Risk Assessment Tool:** Provide sellers with an interactive checklist or risk score based on item rarity, destination country, and shipping method. This tool can recommend best practices (e.g., recommended packaging, insurance options) and alert sellers to any potential risks or limitations, helping them make informed decisions before listing."

      "1. **Introduce Transparent Reserve Price Indicators:** Add a clear, non-intrusive label on auction listings with reserves explaining why a reserve is set (e.g., \"Reserve price protects seller on rare/vintage items with uncertain market value\"). Include an optional tooltip or FAQ link to educate buyers on the purpose and fairness of reserves, reducing confusion and negative feedback.",
      "2. **Enable Seller-Buyer Reserve Price Communication Tools:** Implement a feature allowing sellers to optionally share a confidential reserve price range or minimum acceptable price with interested bidders via a secure messaging system. This can help buyers understand the seller’s expectations without publicly disclosing the reserve, fostering trust and reducing “fairness” complaints.",
      "3. **Offer Dynamic Reserve Price Suggestions Based on Market Data:** Provide sellers with AI-driven reserve price recommendations that factor in rarity, past sales, and demand signals. This helps sellers set more competitive reserves that balance protecting value and encouraging bidding, potentially reducing polar bidding outcomes and improving conversion rates."

Include a prompt like “Your shipping address is set to [address]. Change?” to prevent accidental reversion.",
      "2. **Unified Payment & Shipping Info Sync:** Ensure that when users enter payment details for autopay or saved payment methods, the associated shipping address is automatically synced and locked in for that transaction unless explicitly changed by the user, reducing discrepancies between payment and shipping info.",
      "3. **Real-Time Checkout Summary with Alerts:** Introduce a real-time summary panel during checkout that dynamically updates payment method, shipping address, and delivery options. Add contextual alerts if any critical info (like shipping address) changes after payment info is entered, prompting users to review before finalizing."

      "2. **Proactive Tracking Update Notifications & FAQs:** Introduce automated notifications that inform sellers when tracking hasn’t updated within expected timeframes, along with tailored tips on next steps (e.g., contacting the carrier, verifying packaging). Supplement this with an easily accessible, dynamic FAQ section addressing common shipping and tracking concerns, including the use of labels on different mailers.",
      "3. **Integrated Shipping Support Chatbot:** Deploy an AI-powered chatbot within the seller dashboard that can answer shipping-related questions instantly, such as label usage, packaging recommendations, and tracking issues. This tool would help sellers troubleshoot problems like the one described, improving trust and reducing frustration that can impact conversion."

    "text": "my subreddits Hey all I'm looking to get some insight from maybe another seller who has been in this situation? Back in May(yes 4 months ago) I sold a vintage Fendi bag on ebay at $3200. This qualified for ebay authentication which I'm very familiar with because my entire business is selling vintage archival designer bags. Within around 3 hours of the purchase the buyer had reached out to me asking to cancel the order because she found it on my direct website for cheaper which we all know is not allowed and I had already printed the shipping label and packed the item. So I let her know that and she said it was fine so I shipped the item out to the authentication hub. Authentication comes back authentic and item matches listing description and ebay ships it to the buyer. About 5 hours after delivery the buyer says ths bag has a huge gaping hole in it and sends me a photo. It was a huge hole and obviously I'm shocked because I sent the bag out in excellent condition. I also have a packing video, as I video tape every package I send out for this reason, and there is no hole. The buyer escalates it to ebay and sends it back to their authentication center. The authenticators review the item and deny it saying the hole wasnt there when they inspected it either, so they deny the return and ship the damaged bag back to her, where she then tries to refuse picking it up from the post office for days and then ebay finally closed the refund case and I thought it was all handled until today I receive a message from ebay saying that the buyer opened a dispute with her financial institution. The notice said I was protected under seller protection guidelines and that no further action is needed at this time, but if the buyer escalates the dispute they'll let me know if action is needed. Is there any chance I'll be on the hook for this buyer very clearly damaging an expensive bag hoping for a return?",

    "raw_text": "Hello, I am reporting a serious issue involving my recent purchase, item #[Removed by Moderator] ( Charizard 004/102 Base Set (Shadowless) Holo PSA 9 ). After completing this purchase, I discovered another active eBay listing — item #[Removed by Moderator] — showing the exact same PSA certification number (#[Removed by Moderator]) , identical card, and identical PSA slab. Since PSA certification numbers are unique, two listings showing the same number suggest one of the following: One or both listings are using stolen photos or counterfeit items, or The seller may be attempting to sell the same card to multiple buyers. Additionally, after my purchase, the seller ([Removed by Moderator]) issued me a partial refund of $9,038.38 but opted to not refund the $1,000.00 portion of the sale that was donated to charity . This appears to be an attempt to avoid refunding the full transaction amount, despite the authenticity and legitimacy of the item being in question. I've asked the seller to refund the remaining amount and will update if/when they respond. I contacted eBay's customer service and they said that, as of right now, they are unable or unwilling to refund me the $1000 charity donation portion of the purchase. Details: Purchased item: #[Removed by Moderator] Duplicate listing: #[Removed by Moderator] PSA Certification Number: [Removed by Moderator] Order number: [Removed by Moderator] Amount paid: $10,038.38 Partial refund received: $9,038.38 Amount withheld (charity donation): $1,000.00 My purchase date: November 9, 2025 • • Seller username(s): [Removed by Moderator]",

Implement a dashboard alert for sellers when ESE labels show missing scans, with proactive guidance on next steps to avoid negative impacts on seller metrics.",
      "2. **Automated Seller Protection for ESE Labels:** Develop an automated safeguard that prevents ESE label-related tracking issues from lowering seller performance scores. For example, automatically exclude shipments with known ESE tracking gaps from “Tracking uploaded on time and validated” metrics or provide a grace period before penalizing.",
      "3. **Flexible Shipping Label Options with Cost/Benefit Insights:** Offer sellers an easy-to-understand comparison tool within the label purchase flow that shows cost differences, tracking reliability, and potential impact on seller ratings between ESE labels and alternative carriers like Ground Advantage. This empowers sellers to make informed choices balancing cost and trust."

I recently purchased a collectible card a Dodgers x One Piece card that was described as being in NM/Mint condition. Upon opening the mail, I noticed a massive dent and crease on the bottom right corner. This card is nowhere near NM/Mint condition, as that damage completely destroys its value. I ve been an eBay member for 15 years, with hundreds of 100% positive reviews. This is the first case I ve ever opened. eBay has stated that, because the card went through their authenticity program, the item cannot be returned or refunded. This suggests that either the seller was aware of the damage, or the authenticator failed to properly inspect the card meaning eBay likely skimmed through the process without adequate authentication. I ve tried contacting the seller multiple times but haven t received a single response. I also took numerous photos and even recorded a video of myself opening the sealed mail from start to finish, clearly showing the damage to the card. I spent $1,200 on this card before the Dodgers won the World Series, so there would be no reason for me to damage it myself or attempt to return it afterward. Again, I have full photo and video evidence and want to bring this issue to the public s attention. Since this was such a significant purchase, I m willing to take this further even reporting it to the news if necessary. Yes, I m willing to spend additional money if it means proving my innocence in this purchase. This is incredibly shady business and not how proper authentication should work. Authenticators should take clear, detailed photos of the card front, back, corners, everything. I am appealing this case, and I refuse to lose it.

Create a clear post-refund reconciliation process visible to buyers and sellers that explains how eBay handles refunds and reimbursements in disputed cases, including options for buyers to confirm external payments to sellers and for eBay to adjust seller accounts accordingly, preventing confusion and encouraging resolution within the platform."

Ebay promptly told me the seller provided tracking information that said the package was delivered and so I would not be receiving a refund.

I feel the photo he provided isn’t very clear. It looks tilted, and a bit overexposed. I’m really wondering… what are my chances of winning this case?

    "text": "my subreddits Went to the Front Row Card show in Pasadena yesterday. First time going to any real event for pokemon cards. I feel like I made out pretty good. In anticipation of the event, I had been saving almost all sealed product I could find in my Target and Walmart adventures. At market value I went into the show with $270 of stuff(paid MSRP for everything). Managed to trade up to a Phantasmal Flames ETB, a Mega Charizard UPC, and one of those full art display pack things from the new Avatar set for my daughter. Also traded to get her some singles, and a few $ off of a playmat and card sleeves from worlds. All the singles I traded for. A couple of them had $5 or less cash to finish the deal.

I have a near complete set of the following All English Alt Arts in BGS 10 All English and Japanese Alt Arts in CGC Pristine (By Alt Arts I m counting Sun Moon to Scarlet Violet (SIRs only, not IRs) which is a total of roughly 235 cards) I m still working on those sets, but it s starting to get very hard to find the remaining cards. So in the meantime, even though it s probably very excessive lol, I want to get a 3rd copy of each English alt art in gem mint condition as well, in either PSA or TAG. I just think 3 full graded sets by different grading companies would be incredibly unique and cool. And then I wouldn t mind letting one set go if the value ever spikes up in the future On one hand a PSA 10 complete set would hold the most value long term but the chase is non-existent (there are thousands upon thousands of PSA 10 copies for each card) and I think the PSA slabs just look ugly as hell A TAG set would be way better in visual appeal (in my opinion) and the chase would be harder as well due to smaller pop counts. Another benefit of TAG is that I can swap out some gem mint copies for a pristine copy if I can ever find one. However if I ever want to liquidate it then I know it ll be harder than PSA Thoughts? What would be cooler to do? I plan to keep this set along with my BGS and CGC set in my PC for a very long time. But at some point in the future I may consider letting go of one of the sets",

This builds buyer trust and reduces deceptive listings.",

Additionally, integrate a system that flags suspicious listings where images or serial numbers match items not owned by the seller, using AI image and data matching.",
      "3. **Buyer Protection & Dispute Resolution for Collectibles:** Introduce a specialized buyer protection program for collectibles that guarantees refunds if the item received does not match the advertised authenticity or provenance. Provide a streamlined dispute resolution process with expert appraisers to verify claims quickly, increasing buyer confidence to convert on high-risk purchases."
