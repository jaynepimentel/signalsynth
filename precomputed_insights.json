    "text": "Buyer losing his shit Guy ordered a game from me, upon receiving it realized it had 4 misc discs in it and requested return and refund. Absolutely no problem, this was my bad. It ended up in the wrong pile and should not have been listed. Initiated refund through eBay, approved and paid for shipping label. $ came out of my account. No big deal. He later messages me demanding his money back and starts a chargeback through his bank. eBay at this point tells me they’ll handle it and nothing is needed from me. Cool. He’s continuing to message me about his return. I’ve tried to explain to him it’s out of my hands now but he seems a few crayons short of a box. Block and move on? He’s also left a review that’s a blatant lie. I’ve never had this level of BS from a buyer.",

Escalated and asked Ebay for help. They told me to wait and keep trying, but ultimately stepped in. Then they made me try to file a police report, which took forever and the NYPD refused to even take it. I finally got refunded, and I promptly left a negative review for the seller describing what had happened. This is a relatively small seller and I did not violate any of Ebay's feedback policies. A few hours later my review is gone and the seller is back up to 100% positive. How does something like this happen? What's the point of reviews if the negative ones warning against bad experiences are just tossed? Sorry but this whole experience has been very frustrating.",

    "text": "Item delivered 37 days ago, Today Ebay claims misdelivery Hey everyone, I’m having an issue where a package was marked delivered 37 days ago both in the ebay app and on USPS. It sat at the authenticators for 22 days, so I asked ebay what was taking so long, and they said they never recieved it (despite what it said on the app). Took about 2 weeks dealing with customer service, and now they’re saying USPS misdelivered the package. Went to USPS and they said that makes no sense, as the package would have been sent back to me. I’m pretty confused and would love some guidance from expert sellers. Has anyone found themselves in a similar situation where Ebay and the Shipper are disagreeing with eachother? How do you think I should proceed? Thanks",

    "text": "(US to Canada) Buyer asked to \"mark the receipt as cheaper\" b/c tariffs? Hi guys, new poster here with a new-to-me situation. A Canadian buyer purchased a cotton zip up hoodie from me (Disney licensed, new with tags) and left the above message in the buyer note asking me to reduce the reported cost of goods to reduce their potential import costs. I have 2 concerns: 1) Assuming doing so would constitute some type of customs declaration fraud, and I do not wish to risk my seller status or go to jail, how do I respectfully decline the buyer's request? 2) How would I even do what they're asking me to do, since Ebay handles the international shipment from their hub? The kindness of the note suggests they won't leave negative feedback when I decline them, and I imagine Ebay would let me dispute that anyway. But I have zero experience here and would appreciate any insight. Thank you.",

I’m not listing anything right now and not promoting a specific product — just trying to understand the rules before I do anything. I’ve sold most of my boxes on eBay, but between fees and long payment holds, I’m exploring other options within the hobby community. If selling is allowed here, what’s the standard way people handle transactions safely? Is PayPal G&S the norm? Do people use middlemen? Any best practices to protect both buyer and seller? Appreciate any guidance — just want to make sure I follow the rules and do things the right way.",

It arrived and the tag is tied on with ... JUTE TWINE? Not even a plastic tag that you would normally see, or nice elastic. The tag is a printed tag that someone made with a label maker, with the description of the item. These items usually have nice large colorful tags with the brand name and instructions, never attached with jute twine. Item also had wear of course. My question is, what human on this earth, sees this, and thinks yep that's new with tags? If this was what new with tags meant, I could drag out all my old things and make them all brand new with a roll of jute and a label maker. Heck... you can get 200 feet of jute for $1.99.

    "text": "International shipping tracking? I purchased an item from a seller on February 1st, and as of today, though it's been marked shipped, the package hasn't been received by USPS. I tried reaching out to the seller several days ago and got no response, so after 10 days of no update on the tracking number, I contacted eBay and asked what they could do. The worker agreed that 10 days of no update seemed suspicious, so they marked the item as unreceived and tried to reach out to the seller, telling me that if there was no update in another week, eBay would step in and help. Literally within minutes, I got a really rude response from the seller telling me that the tracking number didn't update because it's being shipped internationally and hasn't yet arrived in the US, and \"I don't know why you're urging so much, you'll get the package within 1-2 weeks\". They want me to contact eBay and close the case, but I'm not responding and simply waiting to see what happens with the tracking. If the tracking updates or the item arrives, obviously the case will close itself and I won't get a refund, so I'm prepared to just let this play out, but is this a normal occurrence?? I figured that paying for tracking for my item would mean tracking from start to finish, not just from the time it arrives in my city to when it's delivered by USPS... I'm also a little burned that they didn't answer this to my message days ago, feels like they're just going off on me because eBay contacted them and asked them for an update. What would you do, leave the case open or close it?",

I don't know if I'm doing it all wrong, but anyway, once I have an order, I pack my article and go straight to FedEx, they make a proforma invoice that is sent with the parcel. I then add the tracking number, and wait for it to get delivered. During my last sale, the parcel was held by customs, requiring more documents, and so FedEx sent me a paper to fill, which should have been filled with shoe details (materials made with, construction type, lining, sole...)... I'm not doing the ebay method by buying a shipping label... if I add any other fee to my sale I'll be at a loss. cause it costs me \"product's value+ebay's fees+ high shipping cost\", so I'm left with a tiny margin, unless I sell a high value product, which is something I'm not ready for yet. do you think it's a good idea to print my own commercial invoice, that should include my personal information, receiver information, tax ID, product value... (I'm not a company)... or should I just keep doing it with the proforma invoice with FedEx? what do you think is the most professional way to do it? your help is greatly appreciated",

My local PO doesn’t even have a kiosk... they just scan whatever you leave on the counter. Say what you will about USPS, but in my experience it always gets there eventually. I’ve shipped thousands of packages with USPS and haven’t had a single one lost. Plenty of delays, sure, but nothing permanently missing. On the other hand, I’ve shipped far fewer packages with FedEx and somehow still had 3 or 4 completely lost, which is honestly kind of impressive considering the volume difference.",

I pulled out the game only to see my \"like-new\" game covered in scuff marks and scratches, gunky spots of mystery substance, not one but TWO mom and pop secondhand shop labels on the game case, warped cover art where the air meets the top of the paper and lovely sharpie dot on the bottom left of the case. This game case looked like it could've been living on the floor of the previous owner. The game disc was thankfully in good condition but still dirty. Yes I setup a return.",

Idk if the collection box is still broken, they're lazy, or what. Probably all. They also allow homeless people to sleep in these USPS placed which I guess I don't mind. But still shows their lack of professionalism. I also had issues with this post office delivering the wrong mail to my house.of course I don't want to leave my packages out in the open but they don't even bother to put up a it's broken sign on the box before wasting my time there. who to complain to? also have an eBay question. I have to send a package ASAP and since the box is locked today I want to send this and another package tomorrow at another post office. I got an eBay notice I have 24 hrs to ship but I already scanned the label there. will I still be late if I send it via another post office tomorrow?",

I have a couple of questions: 1) is it advisable? A part of me says no because if I'm the one paying and organizing for the insured shipment, in case of problems the buyer would open a case against me and me against the courier, but if the buyer is paying the courier, they could then open a case for missing receipt of the item as well a case against the courier 2) in case it is, how to deal with that on eBay? Proceed as usual but require a tracking code to put on the item selling before giving the package to the courier, so that the actual tracking is guaranteed? Thank you!",

Hi Sorry we checked your parcel has been returned by shipping company. We are willing to refund to you. But it was failed because of opening inquiry.

The auctioneer claims everything sold is \"donated to them\". Won't say who the consignors are (which is odd and I think legally required in my state?) There's always a bunch of high end coins, tons of gold jewelry, sterling silver flatware sets, and just tons of expensive merchandise. The stuff sells obscenely high because I'm pretty sure coin and antique dealers are \"donating\" the stuff and running their own lots up. I've been to six auctions and seen stuff sell multiple times for 2-3 times where it would sell elsewhere. The auctioneer claims \"all the money brought in goes to the wildlife rescue\". Whole thing seems really weird. This isn't a typical charity auction by any means. People don't donate 2-5k worth of gold jewelry every single time (twice a month), or thousands of dollars of silver and sometimes gold coins.",

Two days ago the buyer decided to email to say he bought it for a family member and they said the battery was only lasting 48 hours. I know for a fact the battery life was perfectly fine when I advertised it as “Used and in perfect condition” All I could do was offer advice that battery life depends on user preference ie screen brightness, time spent reading etc and that I had no idea how it had been used for the last 2 months so there wasn’t much I could add as it was my responsibility when the item had been out of my possession for last 2 months. They could have jumped on it and thrown it through a window everyday for all I know. Apparently I spoke to him like a fool and I cant claim to have sold it in \"Perfect\" or \"Excellent\" condition. Its out of ebays 30 day window so he ended the email quoting that he has PayPal Buyer Protection on the item for 180 days. A quick Google search showed that PayPal revised their policy recently and if an item is claimed to be “Not sold as advertised” the buyer now only had 30 days to make a claim Is through Paypal, is this correct or am I reading it wrong? *\"Significantly Not as Described claims must be opened by the buyer in the Resolution Center within 30 days of the delivery or fulfillment of an order or within 180 days of the date a payment was sent by the buyer to the seller, whichever is sooner.\"*",

The buyer opened an INR case, eBay refunded them, and I appealed. I was supposed to get a callback from eBay but never did. Fast‐forward to now: the package has finally been delivered. The buyer has gone completely silent, and eBay is telling me the case was closed and the appeal was denied before the delivery scan happened. Has anyone gotten reimbursed after the item eventually shows as delivered? Does eBay actually reverse the refund or pay the seller out when this happens? I’m not trying to let someone walk away with both the item and the refund.",

    "text": "PS Vita dev kits - PDEL-1001 Hi all, I have a few of these dev kits and I had planned on holding onto them but situation has changed and I need to reduce my collection size? Is there any interest in them? If so I can take more pictures. I would rather a true collector get them rather than put them on eBay for some company to buy. Other then to take a picture I have never taken them out of the box. I won't reply to DMs, if you have questions/ comments post them here. Thanks! UPDATE Feb 9th: Question for you all, should I try to plug one of them in and power it on? These were in the original box they were ordered in (dec 2014) so they have never been plugged in. Second if the battery is not good should I swap the battery before listing? Also what system do you use to exchange devices? I was thinking just post on eBay and then post the link here? Also a NIB has not been sold for many years and all the sales I could find in the last few years have been used ranging from 600-900. so what price should I list these at? Claude is suggestion 1k-1.5k so is $1.2k reasonable? I am selling these cause I need the money so I cant just give them away. UPDATE 2: If you are a Developer then you can message me or post below and we can work out something. include links to projects you have worked on. Update 3: I have tested all 3 and they work. I took pictures and a video of them booting.",

I declined the return request and then 10 minutes later I received a payment dispute with the reason being “The item doesn't match the description in your listing.”.

I am getting a very high demand item directly from the manufacturer, but they are worried about what I show as my item’s location. They had issues last time I got something similar from them, because once people see anything like this listed on ebay, they flock to stores and destroy the state’s retail distribution where they see the items location as. They want me to set the item location on the other coast, so people think it is being distributed over there first as they will be able to keep up with retail demand better there. They are still trying to recover in my area from last time I got something similar from them. I want to do this too, so people don’t know where these are being distributed for retail to first and then becoming competitors. I picked these up from the manufacture already and I would be shipping from my place on one coast, but the listing would show being located on the other. I am going to add 3 extra days for handling time to make sure shipments are on time. It does not seem like there is a clear answer if eBay is going to be upset about this. It sounds like it is a policy violation, but any large retailer is going to have multiple shipping locations and the items’ location just won’t be accurate in those cases. My account is 15+ years old with $200k 90 day sales right now and I don’t want to kill my account over this. Has anyone done anything similar and how did eBay respond?",

I have a multi-variant listing with several options. Now I am wondering how I should set the shipping costs. Is it better to offer free shipping with a Top-Rated Seller badge, or charge a flat shipping fee once? The advantage for the buyer with a one-time shipping fee is that they save money on multiple purchases. With free shipping, they wouldn’t save, because I would have to factor the shipping cost into the product price. The disadvantage for me is that I might lose visibility if I don’t offer free shipping. Based on your experience, what would you recommend?",

    "text": "eBay prices I'm having an annoyed morning and wanted to open this to discussion. For context, I'm 42M games industry exec aiming to collect the full NTSC NES set, loose. I'm far into this journey and good at pricing and understanding variability where it's deserved. And I'm not talking grails here, I'm talking sub-$100 titles that are regularly available. My core issue: many sellers are adding their assumed eBay costs into the list price so that it nets them the \"value\" of mean price charting value. But the fallacy is that mean eBay price is based on what it sold for on that platform, the actual value is maybe 60% of those prices. B&M shops get away with selling for these prices outright because they have legitimate overhead and convenience, plus an assumption of service and reliability. Also, anytime can walk or and say \"I'll just buy it on eBay\" if the price isn't met or beat. But if you're selling on eBay, the price IS the PC price, and your net is whatever's left of it after eBay is done taking their cut. And within that is a spectrum of variable value based on the actual quality of what you're selling. You don't get to sell an okay condition torn label monster for the mean price on PC plus 30% to \"cover your costs.\" Anyway, really over, would love to hear some opinions.",

Things have really changed so I have been spending a lot of time reading do's and don'ts. I want to be prepared before jumping in feet first. Thanks to this sub I learned that funds are held for 21 days, which is perfectly fine, I get that. My question is...items that have been paid, shipped and reviewed, can you use those funds for shipping? Meaning will ebay use that instead of taking the money out the account you have set up?",

Spent days on end tinkering, trying apps, setting up launchers, getting meta data, installing apps and pushing the thing as far as I can with HD packs and the like. The thing is, now I have pretty much everything up and running, I find myself not really using it. I think I enjoyed the tinkering and problem solving of getting things to run, such as gamehub/ gamenative games, project Zomdriod, the 3ds HD packs and Wii U controls for Mario Galaxy. Now most things either run well or I've hit a wall where they aren't likely to according to various community sources, I find myself going to play something much as Pokemon ZA on Eden or FF Crisis Core on Gamenative and end up just switching to my MSI Claw, Switch 2 or PS5/ PS Portal as generally the MSI handles emulation better or being Windows can just run the games without needing emulation and obviously the PS5 and Switch 2 play things without issue. I love the duel screens, but at nearly 44, outside of nds, wii U or 3ds, I don't really use both unless I'm reading a guide while trying to sort something out as I don't have the brain power to play a game and actually take in anything in a meaningful way other than what's on the top screen without pausing. So I'm wondering, now the tinkering is done, is it worth hanging onto for anything outside of 3DS emulation and smaller form factor than my Claw. The prices for them on Ebay here in the UK are going for around the price I paid for it or more and I'm just worried that now I don't seem to be using as much, it will decrease in value as the batches get shipped out and I'll lose money if I decide to part with it in the near future. Anyone have any hot takes to talk me into/ out of selling?",

    "text": "Since when eBay applies US VAT to UK sales in the UK? The item is listed in the UK from a UK seller from which i have been buying many times, how come after the auction ended this shows up and instead of £185 i have to pay £222? And yes, i did ask ebay, they are investigating Edit: After speaking to a few representitives and a manager the problem became obvious. Apparently the seller can list items with price without VAT and the listing itself will say that 20% VAT will be added on top of the price. After checking the sellers listings now it shows on all of their listings that 20% VAT will be added. I am pretty sure that wasn't there 2 days ago but it's a very small 1 line text that i could have missed. To be clear, when you open the listing nowhere it says that 20% will be added, only in search. During the bidding process there is not a single line saying you have to pay 20% on top, there is no mention from eBay nor from any visible place. I have been buying for more than 10 years and from this seller, I have never seen VAT charged separately on [ebay.co.uk](http://ebay.co.uk) Anyway, this is ridiculous, i will be getting a mark on my account for non payment and the seller decided to block me from buying from them instead of understanding that the change they made might be upsetting to people when it's not obvious at all and there is no warning.",

    "text": "ebays random payment delay is a bad business practise executed in an unprofessional manner I have a fairly new account and ebay delays my funds from the start. for packages the tracking number needs to be marked as delivered, but for mail additionally the buyer needs to also give a positive feedback, but even than sometimes still funds are kept. otherwise they hang for weeks. ebay puts an additional 3 days on top, so even when everything is confirmed, received and customer happy, still 3 days before funds are getting paid. add to that there is no instant pay, but the usual bank transfer of a day or more. I have good service status with 100 % and it has been confirmed from a capable supporter a month ago that my status is not the issue. ebay does this randomly. when I call the hotline the person is so clueless they don't even know what ebay is doing and I have to repeatedly explain to them, who supposedly are experts, that my issue is general and not specific to a certain sale. the support quality is so low it is not funny. it is not that I do not get what ebay does here, but there is zero transparancy, the supporters aren't informed, there is no time line, no outlook. on top of course the system does not work, meaning usually at least one item hangs where supposedly everything went well, but ebay still recognizes it as not ready for payout. this post got removed without any reasoning from the main ebay sub.",

Luckily I got a good deal on it but it just came in and I noticed some edge damage that makes it not look gem mint PSA 10 in my opinion. I’m not sure what to do moving forward. I messaged them on eBay hoping to rectify the situation and I am waiting for a response. But I guess I came here for advice from the community to see what you would do in this scenario.

    "text": "Very, Very, Very Big: The Case for Macy's, Children's Place, and the GameStop Roll-Up The eBay thesis keeps showing up and I need to explain why it falls apart and what actually makes sense when you follow the money and the pattern. **Why eBay Doesn't Work** eBay is a $42 billion company near all-time highs with 2.9% short interest. No distress. No squeeze potential. GameStop already partners with PSA for authentication and PSA owns the eBay vault, so that synergy exists without buying anything. You don't acquire something 4x your size with cash anyway. That's not how this works. **What Cohen Actually Said This Week** In interviews with CNBC and the Wall Street Journal, Cohen laid out exactly what he's hunting for. He's looking in the \"consumer or retail\" sector for something \"very, very, very big\" and \"transformational.\" A publicly traded company that's currently undervalued but is \"high quality, durable, scalable with growth prospects.\" He wants \"diamonds in the rough\" with a \"sleepy management team\" behind the wheel. He called this strategy \"way more compelling than bitcoin\" and compared it to Berkshire Hathaway, \"except what Berkshire did in decades, we're attempting to do in a much shorter time.\" The plan is to \"apply the Cxxxy and GameStop mindset of brutal efficiency and increase the profitability of the company very, very quickly.\" He also filed an SEC 13D stating he \"believes that any Chief Executive Officer who fails to buy stock in the open market with their own personal funds should be fired.\" eBay is a tech platform. That's neither transformational nor retail nor unprecedented. **The Targets That May Actually Fit** **Macy's:** - Market cap around $4.8-5.5 billion - Down 70%+ from highs - Short interest around 7% - Generates roughly $1 billion+ annual EBITDA - Owns an estimated $5-8 billion in real estate - Anchor tenant in hundreds of malls - 450 Macy's stores plus 268 Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury stores - 167 year history **Children's Place:** - Mark",

It's an amazing set from a hotel in La Grande, Oregon circa 1925. We're located here in the Pacific NW and the only local antique dealer interested in the set is asking us to name a price. I have no idea if I should be asking $200 or $2000 for it. They include 46 Meyer China pieces, 10 R Wallace silver soldered pieces, and 7 glassware pieces. All are in near-pristine condition. More information on the history of this china and the hotel can be found at [https://rwcn-idwiki-2.restaurantwarecollectors.com/content/la-grande-hotel/](https://rwcn-idwiki-2.restaurantwarecollectors.com/content/la-grande-hotel/) What's a reasonable price?

Now that's a pretty limited run these days. Well surfing the net and watching some YouTube vids has shown me that Backyard Breaks had 50 cases, or 10% of the entire print run. Filthbomb was given a similar allocation, so now we are at about 20% of the print run without factoring in a single other breaker that gets allocation from Fanatics. Single boxes are so limited on the secondary market that they are going for 5x. There are a grand total of 23 available to purchase on eBay at the time I'm writing this. Call me a doomer - I don't really give a shit - but this is why you couldn't get Black & White or Bob Ross. And when you cant get those, and you don't want to pay 5x guess where you're gonna go - to the breakers. EQL or not, this is why these products are sold out in less than 5 minutes. Get used to only buying low end products or be a part of the problem and feed the breakers. When I can't get my hands on a case of Platinum Chrome Anniversary Fanatics I will officially be 100% vintage. Good luck everybody.",

I got confirmation from PayPal that the payment was successful and an immediate \"thanks for your purchase\" notification on the eBay app. But I also got an immediate email from eBay to say that the transaction failed. And sure enough when I go into my eBay account is still saying that I've not paid. On the PayPal side it all looks fine, and the payment has clearly been sent. eBay insist it's a PayPal issue and PayPal insist it's an eBay issue. I've raised a dispute with PayPal and they've come back saying that as the payment is showing as complete the \"payment are limited for reversal cancellation or refund by PayPal.\" Anyone seen this before?",

It has eBay's \"authenticity guarantee\", but it is seems suspiciously cheap (£1.9k/$2.5k), and the seller has relatively little feedback (95%+ positive). There's no explanation given for the low price. I'll keep it honest. If it is fake/frankenwatch, I won't know, so I would be entirely reliant on the authenticity guarantee. This would be my first pricey watch so I'm not feeling very confident. I did some brief research comparing the guarantee compared to, for example, Chrono24. I'm feeling very conflicted. How would you approach this if you were brand new to watches? Thanks!",

They made $14,000 in sales (after eBay fees, before cost of goods). My bank account was linked but eBay never paid out. eBay suspended my account in January 2026 before any payout. **Current situation:** \\- $14,000 in sales (Dec 2025) \\- Account suspended (Jan 2026) \\- Funds still held by eBay \\- Never received a single penny in my bank account \\- Friend says he can't pay me and will only pay \"once eBay releases the funds\" \\- Research shows eBay can hold funds 180+ days on suspended accounts **Questions**: 1. Do I owe taxes on the $14,000 for 2025 even though I never received the money? 2. How do I handle this on my tax return when the funds are still held? 3. What if eBay never releases the funds? I don't have invoices for cost of goods (friend was supposed to provide them but hasn't). I'm in Canada if that matters. I'm really stressed about owing taxes on money I never got. I'd really appreciate any help and advice in this matter.",

    "text": "What New Users Should Know About eBay Account Verification and Limits eBay is one of the largest online marketplaces, but many new users don’t fully understand how account verification, selling limits, and compliance checks work. To sell smoothly on eBay, users must complete identity verification, connect valid payment details, and follow marketplace policies. New or incomplete accounts often face lower selling limits, delayed payouts, or additional reviews—especially during the early stages. Some common challenges users experience include: * Low listing or selling limits on new accounts * Verification delays due to mismatched information * Account reviews triggered by unusual activity * Policy issues caused by lack of platform experience For anyone planning to use eBay for long-term selling, it’s important to understand how account age, verification status, and consistent behavior affect account stability. Following eBay’s guidelines from the beginning can help reduce risks and avoid unnecessary restrictions. https://preview.redd.it/kdr6mktjmicg1.png?width=2240&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ee0eed4cc466f75d87f88323bdc57b5cba8d9d3",

Before listing products, eBay requires sellers to complete identity verification, link valid payment methods, and follow marketplace rules related to seller performance, disputes, and customer satisfaction. New accounts often face limitations, delayed payouts, or even suspensions if the setup is incomplete or non-compliant. Some common challenges new eBay sellers face include: * Account holds during the early selling period * Verification issues with identity or payment details * Listing limits on new accounts * Policy violations due to lack of experience Because of this, it’s important for anyone planning to sell on eBay to fully understand account requirements, compliance rules, and long-term risks before getting started. Taking time to research and follow best practices can prevent account problems and help build a stable seller profile. If you’ve already sold on eBay, what advice would you give to beginners to avoid early account issues? https://preview.redd.it/6wg8zd02lgcg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2c00c4ec4d0ab51dbfcf734020bec05fd6cacf6",

    "text": "How Much Does an Amazon Agency Charge? A Complete Pricing Guide for 2026 Hiring an Amazon agency can be one of the most important investments you make in your ecommerce business. Whether you’re launching a new product or scaling an established brand, the right agency can accelerate growth, reduce costly mistakes, and take over the time-consuming day-to-day tasks of Amazon account management. But the first question every seller asks is simple: **How much does an Amazon agency charge?** The short answer: **Amazon agency pricing typically ranges from $500 to $10,000+ per month**, depending on: * size and maturity of your brand * number of SKUs * services included * ad spend management * marketplace expansion goals * revenue level and growth targets The long answer requires a breakdown of pricing models and what’s actually included — and that’s exactly what we’ll cover below. # Common Amazon agency pricing models Most Amazon agencies structure their fees using one or more of the following models: # 1. Flat monthly retainer This is the most common structure. You pay a fixed monthly fee for a defined scope of services. **Typical range:** ➡️ $500 – $6,000 per month Best for sellers who want predictable billing and ongoing account support such as: * listing optimization * SEO and keyword research * inventory planning * customer service support * reporting and analytics * account health management # 2. Percentage of revenue Some agencies charge a percentage of your **Amazon monthly sales**. **Typical range:** ➡️ 5% – 15% of revenue This pricing model aligns incentives — the agency grows when you grow — but can become expensive for high-revenue brands. # 3. Percentage of ad spend (for PPC management) If the agency manages Amazon advertising, they may charge based on your monthly ad budget. **Typical range:** ➡️ 8% – 20% of ad spend This often includes: * campaign creation and structure * bid optimization * keyword harvesting * A/B testing * DSP management (if applicable) # 4.",

Yes yes I know, I can go to the store but sometimes even that fails when looking for specific items or I can’t always get there. It also doesn’t help when there’s constant protests about which stores to support and which ones to stay away from (e.g. Walmart, Target, etc). EDIT; I was NOT expecting this to blow up. I was genuinely just curious as to what people used instead of Amazon if they did stop using it or don’t use it as much. I never said that I was going to NOT use Amazon myself. I also understand that there is no “good” companies to support really and replacing one monopoly with another defeats the purpose. I completely understand if you haven’t or aren’t going to stop using it, that’s fair and everyone has the right to do what they wish within reason. EBay, Costco, Aliexpress, etc are all also very valid. Thanks.",

We sell Japanese / anime collectables I made a post just like this a year ago, here's a link to that post if you want to see the differences between 2024 and 2025. Also has some more context on what we do and what we sell: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our\\_2024\\_sales\\_statistics\\_as\\_fulltime\\_ebay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our_2024_sales_statistics_as_fulltime_ebay/) The quick rundown though is we (me and my girlfriend) are full-time online sellers who predominately sell Japanese collectables, of which we import directly from Japan. Mostly obscure, vintage, and rare bits rather than modern stuff you can find anywhere. Most of the time we have over 8000 active individual listings on eBay. Notable statistics: Net Sales: $190,465.79 Profit: $99,167.20 Transactions: 5367 Average ROI: 427.51% All of these number are a touch worse than 2024, but not by much. 2023, 2024, and 2025 all had very similar yearly totals which heavily implies we've reached the limit of what we can make with our current system / setup. This year was interesting, particularly due to tons of changes due to our current... administration. Tariffs were a problem for us, because being Japanese collectable sellers 99% of our inventory comes imported straight from Japan. You'd think it's just a 15% increase in buy costs, because that's what the tariffs are, but it's worse than that. Tons of shipping methods skyrocketed in prices, and many international shipping providers pulled out of shipping to the US entirely. UPS and FedEx both hit you with tons of additional fees alongside the 15% tariffs, often times as \"brokerage fees\". I could go into it but the short of it is... screw UPS specifically. So many issues this year. As well, a lot of panic in the early months of year caused a notable dip in our sales. February was the lowest month we had in years, a s",

    "text": "eBay authentication issue I recently purchased an Omega watch on eBay with the Authenticity Guarantee. The listing explicitly included multiple (3) strap options and an OEM stainless bracelet, which was one of the main reasons I bought this specific watch at the price I paid. The watch just went through authenticity this morning. eBay confirmed that the watch itself is authentic, but flagged a “listing accuracy issue” and stated that the additional strap and bracelet couldn’t be verified and would not be included in the shipment. They gave me the option to accept it without the additional strap and bracelet, or receive a full refund. The problem is that if I want to accept it and just buy a replacement bracelet and strap, just based on a quick search, looks like it’ll be $600-700. So by accepting it, I’m basically overpaying for just the watch head and one strap. Has anyone else had eBay authentication remove things that were clearly shown and described in the listing? Did you accept the item, return it, or get a price adjustment? This is my first time buying from eBay so I’d appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance",

    "text": "eBay Buyer Didn't Use My Insured Return Label An eBay buyer (who has been a **GIANT PAIN**) opened an (false) INAD return, and I provided an insured label for $425. A few weeks later, they opened a case, and eBay issued another label on my behalf (that they're charging me for). The original label was still good, however I suspect she wanted a QR code instead, because she apparently shipped it from a self-serve kiosk. The potential problem is, this other label is presumably only insured for $100. Based on what I understand, if the returned item gets lost or damaged in shipping, eBay generally forces the seller to refund anyway. Is there anything I can or should do? I suppose this is a little hypothetical considering the item hasn't been lost/damaged yet, however I do feel I should be able to insure my returns if I want to. edit: Bonus message history. https://preview.redd.it/ceacx9x91p9g1.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=27c116f488610236c7d1ec7efcfaffc0d0798e2c https://preview.redd.it/6wkd0bx91p9g1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=f863d84a3f95e7c4f28f5edcb3dc0b418637b326 https://preview.redd.it/2wclxbx91p9g1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=10411673dbc310f1569d65a59f0e8e6169bbd47e https://preview.redd.it/iitnrax91p9g1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc99d5848582c6ec07d7b112a825b8672dac53b6",

While I understand that the chances of finding them are slim, I am holding onto hope that someone might be able to help me. While going out last night in Austin Texas I met a woman in her 30s and invited her back to my place. This morning she left my apartment at 05:27 with three of my watches to allegedly catch a flight to Jackson, TN. I have much more details on her name, CCTV and photos of her, her job etc but don't want to dox her here. The three watches and their abbreviated serial #'s are: * Rose Gold Rolex Day-Date (044VG612) * Stainless steel black dial Rolex Submariner (3713K7K1) * Rose Gold A Lange & Sohne Saxonia Thin (268043) I have already taken the following steps: 1. Filed a police report 2. Submitted a missing watch report with Rolex 3. Submitted a missing watch report with Enquirus, Alpha Hands and The Watch Register 4. Contacted watch dealers 5. Got CCTV footage from my building and the bars that we went to 6. Contacted pawn shops in Jackson TN to alert them 7. Setup saved searches on ebay, facebook marketplace and Chrono24 for specific watches I'm still in possession of the original box and papers to check authenticity.

    "text": "Nintendo Hands Free Controller surfaces after 40 years The long rumored and poorly documented hands free controller intended for disabled children to play NES has appeared on eBay. It was long thought that this never went into full production and the only existing example was on display in Nintendo’s corporate office in Redmond Washington. The seller here is a well known whale in the collecting community (meaning when it comes to acquiring items, money usually isn’t an object), and given its relatively low price compared to its rarity and reputation, my guess is he probably found a case or cases of them and has multiple available, and he’s slow dripping them on the market for maximum value. I’m sure more information is to come on this, but this is a pretty wild find.",

I mostly buy my stuff from Uline. Their quality is just terrible anymore. The boxes come misaligned or damaged. The tape hardly sticks. Their customer service is usually good about it but I'm not willign to pay premium prices for low quality products anymore. Where does everyone else get their boxes, bubble wrap, and tape by the pallet load? Edit adding the suggestions here to make them easier to find. Thanks for all the help: * Multiple people have highly recommended The Boxery * Multiple people have recommended Grainger * Global Industrial * Zoro Tools * Value Mailers * Supplyhut * Getting used boxes from businesses like the Dollar Stores. * Smurfit Westrock Many of these vendors sell on eBay for the same price as buying direct as well based on people comments.",

    "text": "Why has eBay completely opted out of the personalised products economy? I want to start a **serious discussion**, not a rant. Personalised products (custom prints, image uploads, engraved items, made-to-order goods) are now a **huge part of ecommerce**. Etsy, Shopify stores, Amazon Custom, and DTC brands are all leaning heavily into it. But eBay seems to have **completely opted out**. Not just “poorly implemented” structurally opted out. On eBay today: * No buyer image/file upload at checkout * No embedded product designers * No design APIs * No way to pause handling time while waiting for buyer details * Sellers get punished for late dispatch even when buyers delay sending info This makes selling personalised items at scale **operationally unsafe**. You end up: * Chasing buyers for details * Receiving info late * Missing dispatch deadlines * Taking account hits for things outside your control What I don’t understand is **why**. This is not a huge technical problem. At eBay’s scale, basic file uploads + handling-time logic would be trivial to implement. The personalised products market is worth **billions per year**, yet eBay seems happy to ignore it entirely. So my questions to other sellers: * Do you think eBay is intentionally avoiding personalisation? * Is it a risk/dispute issue? * Is it about keeping listings interchangeable and price-comparable? * Or is eBay simply choosing not to modernise this part of commerce? I’m genuinely curious how others see this especially sellers who tried personalised products and gave up.",

    "text": "Shipper being billed the recipients import duties/taxes/fees 2 months after delivery is completed? I sell on eBay and I've been shipping internationally with Fedex for years and I've never had this happen before. Before anyone asks I'm not based in the US so unfortunately can't use eBays GSP for international orders, I would if I could. A Fedex shipment to the UK was delivered 3 months ago. I always monitor my international shipments and along the shipping journey it showed the normal International shipment release - Import, which has always previously meant the recipient has paid any duties/taxes/fees which were due, the shipment was then delivered and that was the end of that. I paid the invoice for the shipping when Fedex invoiced me a short while after that. Now 3 months later I received a $110 invoice for the duties/taxes/fees that were due for the shipment. I queried the invoice and the billing department says payment for the duties/taxes/fees was not received within 90 days from the recipient so the shipper is now liable for the charges. But if that was the case how was the shipment even released for import, I have had shipments previously where the recipient has initially refused to pay the duties/taxes/fees and the shipment does not move until they are settled. In those cases I at least have some leverage at that point because my shipments are from eBay sales, if the recipient fails to pay the duties/taxes/fees they forfeit the entire order with no refund and the goods are returned to sender. Once that realisation hits home the recipients have always paid the duties/taxes/fees owing and the shipment is then delivered. But in this case with the item having already been delivered and it now being 3 months down the line I'm right up sht creek with no paddle in that regard. Does anyone have any idea what has transpired here? EDIT : The actually delivery date was over 3 months ago, I was going off of the invoice date which was issued at a later date. I have upda",

Checklist my wife shops a lot on ebay and has been burned by shady eBay sellers before. recently, I started building a tool that lets you **check if an eBay seller/item is legit before you bid.** after some deep research, we came up with a list of things you should self-check before placing bids or buying any thing on ebay. these includes: * Seller account age, rating, and recent activity * Manipulated or fishy reviews * Price anomalies (way too low/high) * Price comparison vs other listings * Suspicious payment methods * Shipping issues / red flags * Reverse image search for stolen or stock photos * Complaints about the seller online (use google) * Any legal disputes **good enough, the tool does this automatically for every ebay item you give it.** It’s early days, but it already catches a lot of stuff. **I’d love feedback from this sub.** what would you add to this list? **Edit:** **Apologies to everyone who tried the tool earlier. the API for ebay data was failing hence the wrong results. we have updated the API now and re-ran all the old scans and the results. kindly take it for another spin. thanks.** you can access it here > [webvetted ebay checker](https://webvetted.com/detect/marketplace/ebay)",

This is actually the second version, the first was missing a volume dial and had some redundant holes for screws. As well as this I found a Steam Deck OLED motherboard on eBay for a good price and designed my own \"Steam Machine\", although I wanted this one to be able to hook onto my belt or pocket so that I can use them with a Bluetooth controller and my AR glasses. It's a bunch of fun and a very silly idea that was a blast to design and make. This also meant I had a dedicated machine for the arcade that I could slot in and out using a little basket. If anyone is interested in the STL files or a longer explanation of how I did it, let me know and I can post them online. Go easy on me as well, I'm very new to this!

I can't tell you how many times its happened. I find a listing I'm interested in, go to the description, and its just \"This item is a quintessential addition to your collection. With a plastic construction and durable metal details, its sure to last. It is manufactured by this company, a well-known brand in this hobby. If features a green color and is suitable for ages 14 and up. This ready-to-play item is 1:45 scale and sure to capture your imagination in miniature form.\" I mean, honestly, can't people see how awful and fake that sounds? The description is there to tell buyers more about the item and help them see if its a good idea to buy it. What I don't want from an eBay description is useless gushing. Added to that, I doubt its even an AI powering it. Most likely, its just a template that fills in the information you give it. Because it all sounds the same. Like, *exactly* the same. I've sold quite a few things on eBay and I've written detailed descriptions for each and every item. Its not that difficult. And you're more likely to make the sale if you put in that effort. I tried the AI description once and I'm glad I read it before listing the item because it told the buyer nothing more than they could clearly see from the title and pictures. Am I the only one who views it this way? So many sellers use it now and its so dumb.",

    "text": "Can I escalate to the Financial Ombudsman if eBay refund buyers using my pending funds without responding to my complaint? Hi, I’m from England and I’m seeking legal advice on this situation. I sold three orders totalling around £2,000 using eBay’s “Simple Delivery” service (which includes Royal Mail tracking and lost-parcel coverage). Two of the parcels haven’t moved since they were scanned into the Royal Mail system, so the buyers opened “item not received” cases. Shortly after, my account was suspended — I suspect because of those two lost parcels, though eBay haven’t confirmed. I was told my payments would be held for 190 days, which I was okay with. However, eBay refunded both buyers using my pending funds, leaving me around £1,500 out of pocket. On the case screen, it said I didn’t need to take any action, and since Simple Delivery is meant to include coverage for lost parcels, I assumed both sides would be protected. I’ve already sent a formal complaint to eBay’s complaints email (confirmed by a customer service agent), but I haven’t received a response yet. My legal question is: If eBay don’t respond to my complaint within 15 days, how do I get a final response letter so I can escalate the issue — and would that go to CEDR or the Financial Ombudsman Service, given that it involves withheld seller funds and refunds taken from my pending balance? Any legal guidance on how to proceed would be really appreciated.",

I was immediately suspicious and stopped bidding. The account with 0 feedback won the auction. To no one’s surprise, the seller just relisted the same item a few days later with a higher starting bid.

    "text": "Never sell luxury items on eBay I’ve been selling on eBay for years, and for the most part, my experience has been fine. I’ve sold tons of low-priced items with little to no issue. But recently, when trying to sell a few luxury pieces, I had this feeling eBay never protect their sellers. I sold a Louis Vuitton bucket hat ealier this year. Without any communication at all, the buyer directly filed a dispute through their bank, not even through eBay, not even talked to me. There was no message, no reason, no return, just a chargeback. eBay said they would “fight for my rights as a seller, and talked to the bank” but after 3 months of waiting, 3 MONTH! I lost both the money and the item. No explanation, no follow-up, nothing. There’s absolutely no real seller protection when the buyer goes through their bank instead of eBay. The second time, I sold a Balenciaga hat (with the original receipt from the store). The buyer insisted it was fake because it didn’t look identical to another Balenciaga product he owned, which is absurd, since even within the same brand, manufacturing differences are normal. I accepted the return request just to resolve it peacefully. But then the buyer left me a huge negative review, all caps shouting “FAKE” in his review, extremely rude and completely baseless. EBay refused to remove this feedback, even though I had proof of authenticity and accepted the return. And of course, sellers aren’t allowed to leave any kind of negative review for buyers, so we just have to take it. I’ve learned my lesson. EBay is not a safe place to sell luxury items. There’s zero protection for sellers dealing with high-value goods. Buyers can make false claims, file chargebacks, and eBay will just shrug and say “we tried.” If you ever plan to sell anything designer or pricey, don’t use eBay. It’s not worth the stress or the loss.",

Sold an item earlier this summer, USPS had delivery delays while the item was in USPS possession, buyer asked eBay for a refund, eBay gave the buyer a refund, then the item was delivered. The buyer confirmed receipt of the item, the USPS tracking number shows the successful, but delayed, delivery. eBay said the dispute was ruled in my favor. Assumed everything would be paid out from there. Been calling eBay customer service every 10-15 days after delivery and they keep saying they'll send payment by way of the appeals department but no payment received. On a recent call I asked to elevate to management and the \"eBay Customer Service Leadership Team\" assured me nothing can be done to get paid for this delivered item. This person informed me that they were the highest level and proceeded to hang up on me. Any else experience this and have success getting paid? It's a $150 order, more about principles at this point.",

    "text": "Ebay starting to hold funds on Return Requests? Hi all, Just some context, top rated business seller and pre-loved partner here, offering free returns on all items. Returns have always been part and parcel, however, recently every return which is requested and automatically accepted now results in eBay holding the funds until it's returned / refunded. Once upon a time this never happened, and very rarely you would get the odd one where they would hold the amount. Obviously this differs from opening a case, which to my knowledge has always resulted in money being held. Does anyone know why this is? It's extremely frustrating for cash flow, particularly when the item isn't returned back after 30 days. Thanks!",

Part 2 Quick update from my previous post about the return case: https://www.reddit.com/r/eBaySellerAdvice/s/tCxZFmOD80 Thanks to everyone who helped and shared information on how to deal with this kind of buyer! The buyer is now repeatedly messaging me, insisting on a partial refund even though eBay has already confirmed that I should not issue or discuss any refunds until the item is returned and verified. I’ve made it clear to the buyer that The case is under eBay’s investigation and that I’ll only follow eBay’s official process. Despite that, the buyer keep sending messages trying to pressure me into a deal. I’ve reported each message under Scam for manipulating the refund process and I don’t even have the option to issue a partial refund on my end and at this point I’m just waiting for eBay’s decision, but it’s frustrating that the buyer is still trying to negotiate outside the system. Should I reply anything back to him? As a bonus, I noticed that the buyer has two active listings for the exact same figure both using the same photo he sent me to claim “damage.” So essentially, he’s trying to sell the figure he said arrived damaged, while also pushing for a refund from me.

    "text": "Buyer requested refund after 8 days, what to do? First-time poster here I’d really appreciate some advice on what to do in this situation. A bit of background: I sold a limited edition Funko Pop (9,500 pcs) on eBay. I uploaded detailed close-up photos showing the box was in perfect condition ,no creases or damage. It sold quickly since I listed it at a lower price than others. The buyer paid immediately, and I shipped the next day. I packed it extremely well: layers of bubble wrap, plenty of padding, and “fragile” tape all around. The Pop was also in a protective case. I even took photos of the packaging before sending it out. The parcel was delivered on October 3rd, but today the buyer requested a return and refund, claiming the box was damaged. I compared the photos, and it’s definitely not the same box I sent it looks like they swapped it. I also checked their profile and saw they resell similar figures for almost double the price. It’s been 8 days since delivery, and I already received my payout. What are my options here? How should I handle it through eBay if I’m confident they switched the item? Thanks in advance for any advice!",

I had some extra 925 nib chains, so I tossed one in as a free gift. Cause it's a pendant and a chain would be nice if they needed one, right? The item passed authentication but failed because it didn't match photos. Because of the free chain I added. This was verified by CS. The buyer didn't even have the choice to accept or reject, it was just automatically sent back. Maybe I'm just stupid or naive, idk.

When I search and find \"large envelope\", it is grayed out and it says that shipping type is not allowed for the class of item. The cheapest shipping allowed on the site is Ground Advantage, which usually costs twice as much. Is there a way to bypass this restriction?

I asked where the price point is coming from, as last solds on Ebay are between £110-£120 / $150-$160. He said he uses Collectr app for pricing. So i went on Collectr app, and its valuing the TAG10 on there at £90 / $120. So, i asked where the $200 counter offer price point is coming from. The above was their response.

    "text": "ULPT: Ebay's 30 day funds hold and how to potentially get around it This is both a warning and a tip for those who weren't warned soon enough. Warning: Ebay lets you sell your first few items and receive payment upon delivery but after a few they then add you to their \"new seller policy\" which requires that your funds be held for 30 days, a rule they refuse to bend or break. If you are like me, unaware of the wait with bills coming up within those 30 days, this becomes a big issues. Tip: To get around this requires putting yourself out there and trusting a stranger but I imagine if you're desperate like I was it's worth it. You can simply message the buyer by going back to your inbox and say that though the funds processed you are still having and issue receiving funds due to policy and would like to discuss further it over email. Then you can ask them to request a return/refund and when they do you will choose the \"offer refund\" option so the buyer can keep the item. Once the refund is processed on their end they can then send you the money over venom or cashapp or whatever. I'm well aware that this isn't going to work every time and relies heavily on the kindness of strangers to not just get straight up robbed but at least its a potential solution where there was none (all of my frantic searching just showed a bunch of people saying there's nothing to be done). I personally am at a point though where I'd rather a random person screw me over than a mega corp and for me it was worth the risk. edit: read where i said this isnt gonna work every time and is reliant heavily on luck/kindness before commenting edit 2: man i forgot how cynical redditors are. yall have fun with that...",

We all see ebays popups saying \"lower your handling time to 1 day\" to get a theoretical increase in sales and I believe its required to get TRS rated. Anyhow, there are several times where I will often ship within an hour or 2 of getting the item sold notice - full product packaged for shipping, label printed, attached, and dropped off at the post office and off it goes. Ive seen people discussing accepting ebay offers on their listed items but getting a payment failed notice. Does it ever happen for auctions or BIN item sales? If so, what happens if you've already shipped the order and then a day or 2 later while the funds are stuck in processing - you get a payment failed notice.

You can't do this on the app, so use the desktop site. If their feedback left for other sellers has a troubling history (you determine the extent), there is a chance your sale may fall victim to a bad buyer. Then decide if you want to block the buyer before entertaining questions or extending an offer. I recently had a buyer ask for a discount on a $10 shipped item. Checked their feedback left for others and it's nothing but item issues after the sale. I immediately blocked the buyer. https://preview.redd.it/qn4lrympdonf1.jpg?width=818&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce703ddfc8eb364297b4ead1c5a6b2b454d0d85f",

    "text": "So I bought a sandworm... Yeah, there it is one of those LJN sandworms from the 80s. These are rare you hardly ever find one in a box and this one was still new in boxes as you can see, he’s still tied down. When the box arrived, it was open. The glue seams had separated, and when I looked inside, I saw the age spotting on this sandworm I contacted the seller to ask if he happens to know anything about this and he spent an hour and a half threatening me and berating me in messages. I shouldn’t have been surprised, but I kind of was - I mean I’ve come to expect the worst in people, especially in recent years, but this guy was really upset and at one point he said - I will fight a return on this Also, and this is important he didn’t offer a photo in the auction of the worm inside the box. The box clearly was open. He could’ve done so. I felt he might be trying to hide the age spotting, though I didn’t say so, and I didn’t accuse him of that . Well, he had been so rude that I thought I’ll just open a return, so I did and I explained and here’s photos, and I uploaded 10 photos and I selected that the item was damaged on receipt and 10 minutes later, the buyer closed the return and eBay didn’t do anything. I’m assuming I should’ve selected item not as described and that’s why this happened and I doubt that there’s anything I can do at this point, I’m out several hundred dollars if so, - but it is a rare LJN sandworm it’s still tied down in box. The box is still there. There are worse things. This impolite fellow said he’s had this thing since he bought it new in the 90s. As an eBay seller who’s been at it for longer than most I am never rude to a customer in messages. I never argue. I never threaten. I don’t use four letter words. I don’t use 10 letter words because sometimes too many words are hard for people to deal with and I doubt people read very well when I write these messages in the first place. They certainly don’t read descriptions or look at photos very well. ",

(i will post the convo in comments below) i know ebay isn't going to do anything about it so i at least want to warn other collectors because they've already sold 71 of these and not one person has left a review confirming or denying authenticity. good luck out there, and peep the photos of this product listing & our conversation below",

    "text": "23 Years on eBay, 100% Feedback — One New Buyer Just Tanked My Score I've been selling on eBay for 23 years with perfect feedback — until now. Recently, I sold an item to a brand-new buyer who registered the same day (my mistake, I know). They left negative feedback claiming the item was broken — but never messaged me, never asked for a refund, nothing. That one review dropped my feedback score from 100% (488 ratings) to 97%. I reached out to eBay and all I’ve gotten are canned responses: * “Make sure your item description is accurate” (it was) * “Respond to the feedback” (I did) * “Message the buyer” (I did — no reply) Here are the questions I’ve asked eBay, and so far haven’t gotten clear answers: 1. **What did eBay do to verify the veracity of buyer’s claim?** 2. **If nothing, does a 1-day-old buyer automatically outweigh a 23-year seller with a perfect record?** ***That's 1 day versus 8,395.*** 3. **What’s stopping this from happening again?** 4. **How does** ***one*** **negative review bring a 488-score down to 97%?** To most buyers, that looks like I've scammed 15 people. 5. **If the item was really broken, why didn’t the buyer request a refund?** I'm not asking for special treatment — just some logic and fairness in the system. Any other longtime sellers experienced something like this?",

    "text": "How I turned a 400$ commercial zero turn to 2,000$ (my 4th mower flip) Picked up this 2007 Yazoo Kees Mid Max commercial zero turn mower after talking the seller down from $750 to $400. It wasn’t some blown-up, hopeless project, the motor already ran fine. The seller just couldn’t keep it mowing because it kept shredding belts (likely from improper routing). When I got it, the mower was dirty and unable to move under its own power. The motor itself ran strong, so I figured it was worth the gamble. I ended up replacing the drive belt and putting on a deck belt, swapped in a new ignition solenoid and 25A fuse (one-time issue I tracked down), added some fuel stabilizer/cleaner to flush out old gas gunk, and eventually had to put on new rear tires after puncturing one while mowing my own yard (previous where already tubed and dry rotted, but did hold air) Total labor was maybe 6 hours spread over a weekend. After cleaning it up and putting about 8 hours of mowing on it myself, I listed it and sold for $2,000 cash in just two weeks. The numbers worked out great: purchase price was $400, total parts and supplies were about $400, so I was all-in for $800. Sold for $2,000, which left me with a $1,200 profit. This was my fourth riding mower flip, and honestly the smoothest. And I’m nowhere near done so expect to see more from this page!",

I have a 2 day handling time and always ship same day or next day - never go past the 2 day time. I processed 5 items today and shipped all 5. I noticed just now that 2 of the 5 say payment is held until 3 days after delivery. The other 3 all went to the payment processing tab. The items held for payment after delivery are not high dollar items - my average sale price is about $95 - and the 2 items are 42 and 59. I haven't gone any extended time away from selling or made any changes that could necessitate some hold flag. I have no disputes or refund requests open or pending resolution. It is also clearly not all of my current transactions doing this - so I'm confused. Does it just randomly hold or not hold payments at random now?",

That raised an alarm as only one item was bought. Anyways item finally “arrives, except it didn’t. I live in a house, and tracking says delivered at front desk. I knew right then and there it was too good to be true. I contact eBay for a refund. They deny it. I appeal it, they deny it again saying seller provided proper documentation... Finally I call eBay and get a hold of an awesome lady who said she has seen this more and more and sellers price stuff under $750, because no signature or picture is required for drop off. I then had to sign a declaration stating I never got this and lying could result in perjury charges... but I finally got my money back. What a nightmare though.",

I have been selling some of my things on my Ebay account to assist me with my bills recently. However, this morning Ebay put my payouts on hold while my account has a 'periodic review'. I spoke with Ebay customer service today and they told me that this review started because I had a noticeable increase in the amount I have sold lately & that it was a standard review. Ebay customer service said it would take likely 5 business days at minimum to finish this review and have my account hold lifted so that I can receive my funds. Since I am in need of these funds now to pay my bills, I am hoping that someone would be willing to loan me the money needed for my bills, and then I could repay them after my account hold is lifted. I am requesting two weeks to pay back the funds as I need to wait at least 5 days for my funds to be released from my Ebay hold and then I will need to have the funds transferred from Ebay to my bank account, which can take another 3-5 days. (Two weeks allows me the time needed plus a few ",

Sometimes it’s flagged for review sometimes it just takes longer than usual for no clear reason. I made a couple changes to try and smooth it out. One thing that seemed to help was switching to a US based account fron Adro banking that can receive ACH and wires directly. Since doing that I think things have felt a bit more stable and I think it’s made my seller profile look a bit more established to the platform. I also started reviewing my return policy and shipping settings to see if anything there might be triggering hold ups especially for new buyers. Cleaned up some of my product listings too just made them a bit more US market friendly with clearer shipping times and localized pricing. Still figuring it all out though. Curious if others have run into the same issues. Is this just part of the game, or are there things you’ve done to reduce the friction with payouts?",

FEES FEES their so goddamn annoying i cant stand it, but my question being is that in the picture 7.15 x 13.25% =0.95, why do they have to include shipping w the fees so that i pay more?? It should be 1.99 x 13.25% = 25 CENTS FOR THEM IF ANYTHING not the fucking shipping label AND the item itself combined to take A WHOLE DOLLAR WHILE I GET CENTS!!! 0.87$ is what i made when realistically it SHOULD HAVE BEEN 1.25 or A FUCKING DOLLAR AMOUNT!!😀😀😀 im about to switch over to actual comic book websites cause atleast (i think) their honest about the fees they’ll charge and take. Don’t give me the “ohhh its ebay thats just how they make their” THEY MAKE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO JUST TAKE THE DAMN QUARTER ANS GIVE THE SELLER THE DOLLAR THAT HE IS RIGHTFULLY OWED!!!!

    "text": "A Observation on eBay pricing I wasn't going to post this opinion piece, but after further thought I decided to post it. This is merely an observation and nothing more. I fully support every individuals right to list items as they please: price, condition, whatever. Do as you will. I am not upset or disgruntled in the slightest, I just have observed a trend ( this trend has gone on for years). When a given item is listed at a bloated price and a customer decides he will pay that bloated price for the item all sellers of that particular item jump on the bandwagon and mark up prices. It doesn't matter if the item is easy to find and plenty on the market. I was at a local used book store and purchased a copy of The Complete Druids Handbook in excellent condition. I paid 30 USD when taxes were factored in. I looked on eBay to see what the rate was and I wasn't surprised to see countless seller listing this book at 60 + in most cases. Many books to be had, not a rarity at all. The eBay market is a quite a ride. I suppose people just want to get paid. This is one of my shipping inserts for clarification on cost of shipping. The buyer picks up the fee but eBay does have it's seller fees to contend with. https://preview.redd.it/l4e79z7wyocf1.jpg?width=770&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b0a12908950c9bd9b01383357c6a87442dd4be",

    "text": "Dear camera sellers: used means it *works* I can’t take it any more. Dear eBay camera sellers: If you’re selling a film camera on eBay and you don’t know whether it works, *please* stop listing it as “Used” with “READ” in the title. If you list it as “Used,” that means it works. Not “it looks ornamental”, not “it might be but it’s your problem now,” it means it *works*. That’s not an opinion. That’s eBay policy. It doesn’t matter if you buried a disclaimer about how you found it at an estate sale and it looks fine, or you didn’t have film so you couldn’t test it and therefore its buyer beware, if you chose used, you chose to categorize your listing with other *working* cameras. If the shutter doesn’t fire, the meter is dead and affects the exposure, the film advance doesn’t move, or you just didn’t test it because you don’t have film, if I get it and it doesn’t work, that’s not a working camera. That’s a parts camera. Which means. I’ll be shipping it right back as Item Not As Described, because there’s a category for nonfunctional items. It’s called “For parts or not working.” That’s the one you should be using. It doesn’t matter what you write in your disclaimer. It doesn’t matter that you put “READ” in your description. The condition you chose overrides it. You can’t select “Used” and bury “I’m not sure” halfway down the listing. If you don’t want to represent that the camera works, there’s a simple solution: *don’t*. So please. If you don’t know if it works, and you don’t want the item back as INAD, use the “For parts or not working” option. Stop dusting your listings with hopium, and let me filter you out if I don’t want to waste my time and energy on your “it might work” listing. Rant over. On behalf of tired photographers everywhere who just want to use the filters on eBay. ETA: I know there are folks on here who for some reason assume that because these are film cameras that they are vintage listings. They are *not* vintage listings: if they were, they wouldn",

    "text": "How I failed my first 3 months in eBay dropshipping (and then turned it around) When I started eBay dropshipping, I wasted a good 3 months doing it completely wrong. I was trying to find the perfect products, spending way too much time researching items, analyzing competition, trying to reverse engineer what other sellers were doing. I maybe had like 50 listings up and I was getting like 1 sale every 3 weeks. Looking back, I realize I was just overcomplicating everything. The turning point for me was when I stopped looking for “winning items” and just focused on volume. Instead of guessing what would sell, I started listing as many items as possible every single day. I use Amazon as my supplier and list the same products on eBay with about a 100 to 105 percent markup. Once I shifted into that mindset, things started to move fast. I went from barely any sales to getting multiple sales per day. And now I’ve got over 10,000 active listings and I’m consistently doing between $1,000 and $3,000 in profit each month. No ads, no complicated setup. Just raw volume. Most people underestimate how powerful that impulse buyer behavior is on eBay. People just scroll, see something they like, and buy it. They’re not checking if it’s cheaper on Amazon or thinking too hard. They just hit buy now. So if you have enough listings live, you’ll naturally catch those eyeballs. I usually list about 100 new items per day. It sounds like a lot but once you get into a rhythm it becomes second nature. I also optimize titles so the listings show up in search, but I keep it super simple. The main mistake I see people make is thinking you need to be clever or find secret products. You don’t. You just need to play the numbers game. That’s what finally worked for me.",

I have used Royal Mail for the past 5 years for every sale in my busisness, have sent well over 3000 large letters/parcels in the UK and sent around 200 units abroad to 20-30 different countrys. Never had one item not arrive, had the odd delay here and there but apart from that, not one problem. i'm a Royal Mail loyalist because of the perfect delivery rate. Recently switched to 'Tracked 48' for every sale due to Ebays new policys around payouts, and sent this parcel at my usual branch on Tuesday 10th June around 7.30am. However, since that day there has been absolute no movement and is stuck on 'sender despatching item'. Every time i read about this, most people blame the seller \"oh that means they have just bought a label but not posted it\". But i did post it and have a proof of receipt. So where can i go from here? Can any RM employee give me an insight into what might have happened here? And do i have any hope it will be updated/resolved? Many thanks",

    "text": "Anyone else struggling with reconciliation between eBay payouts and supplier transactions? Hi everyone, I recently started an eBay dropshipping store and quickly realized how painful the reconciliation process is. eBay gives me payouts, and I need to match them with every single supplier transaction. But the supplier side often has delays or missing entries, and manual reconciliation is super time-consuming and error-prone. To save time, I built an automated system that parses and analyzes both sides and flags discrepancies or missing data. It’s made my life a lot easier. Here is the screenshot: [EBay payout screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/qtX4Q7D) I'm curious: * Are you facing the same problem? * Would you consider paying a monthly subscription for a tool that automates this process? * What features would be a must-have for you? Would really appreciate your input — trying to understand if this is a broader pain point in the dropshipping community.",

My apologies if this situation is common for most of you. The seller in question is small. Only 15 items sold and 6 current listings. Among them are a few comics valued between $40-80 each. I won at auction the most valuable of these comics for under $30. Seller then cancelled and refunded payment due to “missing or damaged item.” They then preceded to re-list for auction that same comic, but this time with a starting price double what I just paid. They didn’t even wait a few days! They put the book I won back up for auction immediately after claiming they’d lost it and couldn’t honor my win. I’m so sick of stuff like this. I’d never think of treating my buyers like this. I’ve only been buying and selling for a few months now, and this is the third time something like this happened. I reported it this time cause it was so brazen and insulting. Does anyone know if eBay takes these complaints seriously? It’s upsetting that I can’t leave feedback on this exchange. Seller only has a 89% rating with only 15 sales though. So I’m not the first person they’ve screwed with. Sorry. Rant over. That item has been on my list for years now. I was excited. Now I’ve got emotional whiplash and I’m trying to avoid going to bed angry. Thank you to anyone who read this far. I hope you’re getting a better site experience than I have lately. EDIT: Whoa. This blew up a bit. So sorry I haven’t responded to you all. I’ve been on the road for work and didn’t think this would generate so much discussion. I’m grateful to everyone here, and I did manage to find a way to leave feedback eventually. Took me till 3am to figure out how, but I was motivated. And I’ll definitely be checking out seller reviews more thoroughly in the future. Thank you everyone.",

Why are we constantly being overcharged for everything and anything 24/7 😩 I don’t really use eBay for this reason. I have another platform that doesn’t charge a tax fee. It’s just harder to sell books on that platform. EDIT: everyone is arguing that everyone is required to pay a sales tax in their state. That’s fine but why am I being charged a 15% fee on THEIR sales tax that is going straight to the government? This just makes the money I make on my item go down more.",

    "text": "Does eBay always hold funds? Does eBay always hold funds for sellers? I thought after 30 or 90 days they don’t hold the funds until 3 days after order delivery? Here was my response from eBay when asked about it. I have 100% seller feedback and 44 sales for a total of around $7,400 in around 100 days. Just making sure this is true and not a line of BS. From what I have read, holds are only supposed to happen for 30 days..sometimes longer..up to 90 days. That’s why I reached out to eBay. Below is the email response from eBay: Hello Christopher, Thank you for contacting eBay Customer Service regarding holds on funds. My name is Abhishek. I understand you wish to know the reason why it is still 3 days. I am more than happy to assist you. First of all, I am really happy to know that you have been doing really good in terms of your selling performance. I can see that you are becoming truly a great seller day by day. There are numerous reasons why funds may be held temporarily. We use holds to encourage best selling practices and to ensure both the buyer and the seller have a safe and smooth transaction. Funds are placed on hold to ensure transactions are completed successfully. In some situations, this means allowing extra time after the buyer has received the item – even if they have left feedback – to review their purchase. This also means funds are available to sellers if they need to accept a return or provide a refund to the buyer. eBay must adhere to certain legal and compliance obligations, outlined in our Payments Terms of Use, which require us to place funds on hold in certain circumstances. We must also ensure eBay remains a safe marketplace for both buyers and sellers. This means we may place a hold on funds for some transactions. These 3 days time is actually a normal time line for every sellers to get their funds, there are cases where funds can be hold for longer than that. But, you have been on eBay now for 100 days there are very less chances to getting l",

Even though I realized the amounts I'm spending and that I'm having a serious problem and I'm trying to control it, I'm still opening the app a few times a day and scrolling looking for anything good. Whenever I see anything I want it takes me less than a minute to go to checkout. What do I do? How do I stop this?

Problem is we used a double wall box and the entire thing had 6\" of bubble wrap around the case. With the machine inside a hard case inside all of this. Buyer opens a return immediatwly upon receipt of unit, and the pics buyer sent show zero damage on the box, it's still perfect. The pics of the \"damage\" on the unit is one panel that he removed and zero damage. The machine was mint when sent out, and the buyer immediately wants a 200.00 partial refund or he will return it. We deny and say send it back, it shows up today in the thinnest, most terrible beat up, old small box. With not even an inch of packing material. The machine is now covered in oily handprints and has parts falling out, so clearly the buyer, WHO RUNS A BERNINA SEWING MACHINE COMPANY. Took parts out and our unit does not function any longer so its obvious. Any way wife will be home later and I want to make sure she gets the best outcome possible, despite being so upset she got scammed. I thought she could deduct 50% as a top rated seller, but I cannot find where it lets me do so when I hit report buyer, ot just gives an option to refund. Should she call Ebay tomorrow as the package just showed up this afternoon and try to get them involved? Or will she just lose a case, most likely, and pay an extra 20.00 if the case does not close in her favor? Your thoughts please, she is pretty upset and I want to help her the best way possible based out what you all think is the best guaranteed/likely positive result. Thank you for your input with your past experiences! Edit: Ebay sided with my wife, they released the hold on her funds and she gets to keep all the funds for the entire sale.

    "text": "Slight rant, why is eBay still making \"recommended\" prices? Was listing a few things, eBay seems to make really dumb recommendation. I wanted to list a working 16TB hard drive, eBay suggested BIN of $11. eeeehhhhh????? Even a non-working 16TB HD is more than $50 so I have no idea why eBay thought this specific brand and model should be sold at $11. I sell LEGO set that I pick up locally at clearance sale and had a couple of 76419 that I picked up for $80 new, they normally go for $170 retail price and a few on eBay for more than $100 used. What did eBay suggest for my 76419, new in box? $22 each!! I really wish I can turn off suggested price permanently because it's using unreliable AI that can't account for condition and/or completeness, and may have grabbed data off someone's replacement firmware chip for the hard drive or a gold colored minifig out of that LEGO set and assumed it represented the whole thing. PS multiple choice listing sucks too. $100 item with $0.99 microfiber cloth makes them show up first when sorted by cheapest. Also keep out of stock listing sucks, they show up weeks and even months as OOS to draw buyer who would think look at seller's other item and end up with a much more expensive item.",

    "text": "I bought a perfume from an Ebay seller. It's a counterfeit so I returned it. The seller has now taken $100 off my return because \"it's been used\" I bought a full-size bottle of perfume from an Ebay seller a few weeks ago. Looking back, this was a dumb decision. The seller had about 30,000 sales and a 5 star average review. Still, I should have looked into this more. This was my own dumb mistake that I won't be making again, however... As soon as I received the item I got a bad feeling it was a fake. There was a sticker on the plastic wrap of the box saying it was made in China. When I took off the wrapping, the box was a bit dented and scuffed. The inside of the box was discolored as well. The bottle of perfume was slightly scratched and the cap to the bottle was scuffed up. I gave the seller the benefit of the doubt, though. Maybe this bottle had fallen off some truck and still could be authentic. However, I have a sample of this perfume already and I sprayed this bottle all of 1 time and it smelled nothing like the sample I have. I know this is a fake. It was sold as a new, sealed box authentic item. I immediately requested a refund, which was immediately accepted. The next day I dropped the package off at the post office with all of the materials I received included in the package (plastic wrap, sticker, bubble wrap, etc.) I just received an email saying the seller is only giving me half of my refund ($90 out of a $180 purchase) because \"it wasn't returned in the original condition\" and \"the item was opened used by the buyer\". This seems a little harsh to me considering a) this is a counterfeit item that I could not have known was counterfeit until I opened the box and sprayed the perfume, and b) the only difference between the condition I received it in and the condition I sent it back in was some opened plastic wrap and 1 spray out of a 75mL bottle of fake perfume. I'm wondering if I have any recourse for this. I know I can \"ask Ebay to step in\" by basically su",

I received three video games this week that were \"very good\" or \"like new\" and they have the perfect lighting for the discs in the pictures and some don't bother showing the back of the discs.. But as soon as you receive them, they have a bunch of light scratches that were not shown in the eBay listing. I just reached out to one of the sellers and they were like \"the manual, case are mint - disc plays flawlessly so that is why its considered mint. if the disc visuals bother you then return it and pay return shipping.\" like wtf. If I want to buy discs like that then they should fall under Good or Acceptable - no excuse.",

    "text": "The / r / gold people have something right about premiums. If you've been following either this sub or the / r / gold sub for longer than a minute then you've probably been able to see this debate in the comments section. I'm planning on an FAQ for this subreddit because this topic comes up so often. Sorry, this is a longish post. There's something that the / r / gold folks understand that is being missed or at least not fully acknowledged from the Goldback side of the community in these debates that may be worth acknowledging here: **Not all gold with premiums are good investments and they may cause a financial loss vs. other forms of gold that run closer to the melt value. In fact, as a general rule, the further away from spot you are, the higher the risk and volatility is.** There have been hundreds, if not thousands of different fractional gold products that have been sold for high premiums, only to be sold for melt or lower down the line. These include fractional bars, fractional coins, and even \"Aurum\" (The technology behind the Goldback). \"Aurum\" in particular has a mixed record. There have been hundreds of \"aurum\" products before the Goldback was invented that have been sold at a steep discount, and ultimately melted down. Most of these were novelties or collectibles with no real or established user bases. There is usually no or little liquidity in other aurum products outside the Goldback. We don't even generally allow other non-Goldback \"aurum\" products to be promoted here. Even 1/10th ounce gold coins minted by the U.S. government have volatile premiums ranging from 10% to 90%+ depending on demand. They are hardly a great deal historically at 90% compared to 10%. The people coming here and calling the Goldback a scam see a gold product with a 100% markup over spot and are concerned. Some of them are rude or here in bad faith but there are good, educated people that see the potential danger. There is a real risk of losing half of your value on the Goldback",
