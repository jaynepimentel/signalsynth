    "text": "Selling 90s old school 10k+ collection but have questions about TCG vs eBay These are the duals. All the cards in my collection are from 93 to 99 (stronghold was my last buy). They have been sitting in boxes since 1999. I logged it all into TCGplayer. Current value listed at about $28,800 with my estimated grades. I have a dealer offering to take it all for $20k pending inspection. I have noticed that there is a wide discrepancy for cards that are listed on TCG player versus recent eBay sales. Like in some cases hundreds of dollars difference. It’s easily possible that at current eBay sales prices, this collection is well over $30,000. More if I take the time to grade the sweeties. At $20k for this type of collection, am I leaving too much value on the table?",

Last year I stopped using the branded tape because of this. I've been using Herkka branded tape on Amazon since then, and had no issues. I ordered another case yesterday which arrived this morning. The tape is clearer on the roll, but smells strongly of glue type chemicals. I checked to make sure nothing had changed in the ad, it did not. I had the same issue a few years ago with another tape company, can't remember the brand. I don't understand the need to do this unless it's cost cutting.",

    "text": "Update: Lugia Neo Genesis — “too shiny”? Just received it. Thoughts? Quick update for everyone who weighed in before. I finally received the Neo Genesis Lugia I bought on Whatnot for $850 USD. A bunch of people said in the original video that it looked “too shiny” and possibly polished or fake. Now that I have it in hand: **Front:** Looks great. Only minor holo scratching, which feels pretty normal for a 20+ year old card. No obvious surface haze or swirl marks that scream polishing. **Back:** This is where concerns were before. In person, it does look slightly shinier and maybe a touch more vivid than one of my other vintage cards. I included a side-by-side comparison with a Stormfront Charmeleon. Also noticed the back feels *slightly* more grippy when I run a finger across it. It’s subtle, not sticky, just a bit different. So now I’m wondering: • Does this actually sound like alteration? • Would PSA catch something like added gloss? • If not altered, what would you expect this to grade with minor holo scratching and otherwise clean condition? **Should I contact the seller/whatnot and request a refund?** Appreciate everyone’s input. Still a little anxious, but trying to be rational about it.

Because I eventually want to move to higher ticket items, it's completely reasonable to expect inventory movement to slow down as a result.

Do I just do what some people do and price it at some arbitrary high price, then gradually lower the price to get more views and eventually a bite? Or, and I haven't seen this suggested anywhere, do I try having it appraised by some professional? From a quick google search, this can range from $50 to $500, which ultimately poses a risk, since, after appraisal, I might already be at a loss, since I now have to account for the appraisal cost when I list the item.

We placed the order on January 18th and were given an estimated shipping date of February 16th. On February 10th, the order page showed that there were 577,434 orders ahead of ours in the queue. On February 13th, I received an email from COMC that the order had moved on to the picking stage and was scheduled to be shipped on time based on the original estimate of February 16th. But on the next day, the shipping estimate had changed to March 31st. As of today, February 17th there are 509,048 orders ahead of ours in the queue. So COMC has processed about 68k orders in the past week, or about 9.77k per day. At that rate, our order should ship on April 10th. So just a warning, if you are ordering from COMC and choose their basic shipping option (despite the \\~$10 shipping fee), you shouldn't expect to see your cards for about 3 months.",

See if you have a local facebook group, private sales could be higher. Do not was your money and time grading. you will spend well over 1k and months to grading, and it will not increase the value. Unless you get psa 10s which you will wait years to find a buyer. Is the 20k the dealer offering in CASH? I would counter with 26k and setting at 24k, if it was all cash.",

    "text": "I do a couple hundred K between ebay and tcg each year. You're looking at 13% in fees roughly then about $15 per order in shipping, insurance, and signature per order for high dollar. Im including average cost of your shipping materials in this. On a $500 dollar order thats roughly 3%. Id say from experience your average is going g to be about 18% in shipping and platform fees. Im too lazy to value everything, but taking the total from of roughly 29k you'd be looking at 23.8k and you'd be dealing with labor, customer service, and scammers. Its worth noting if you sont have a history on either platform youre going to run into issues with fighting scammers until you have feedback and seller rating. Like the comment said above I'd shoot for 24 or so, but realistically I'd take 22-23 for a smooth transaction. Now on the flip if you know these are all clean and are familiar with the grading scale and pop control for these older cards then I would grade them. I've made most of my money grading 10s and selling them, and I usually only sell the cards raw which Im not 90% confident can grade a 10. In the case of these Id be looking for psa 8 and above.",

If you choose to sell these individually you'll have a lot more risk of shipping damage, buyer hassles and occasional scammers (happens on both platforms, which are now both owned by Ebay), cost of your own time, and by the time you add up all the fees, it would maybe be $1-$2K more.

    "text": "Partial refund question - buyer request Hi all, I recently sold a lot of used SSDs (30) on ebay, got a message saying buyer would like to return half of them (15) because SMART data says those drives have 50-66% lifetime remaining, and they don't use anything under 70%, so they want a partial refund or replacement units (which I don't have). Nowhere in my post did I state lifetime or any SMART data, and these were purchased anyway. I don't have returns turned on (I know that doesn't mean much). Just wondering if I should respond, or not respond, and let them open INAD and let ebay deal with it? I didn't describe these how they want and made no such promises for drive health, but they stated I didn't disclose the health of the drives and the value is lower due to this. Just curious what ebay's stance might be in this situation, since the buyer clearly has their own view of what's \"healthy\" and never asked me for any such data. Thank you in advance!",

Mind you, since so many sellers are using AI descriptions, the descriptions aren't as useful as they used to be.

    "text": "Ebay Buyer Closes Return Request And Still Wants To Return I have a weird situation, I sold an item, the buyer opened a return request after 6 days, I accepted the return, posted the shipping label immediately. Buyer didn't say anything for 17 days, he didn't ship it out, so eBay turned the return into a case for me to give the 10 extra days to return, else case closed and I keep money. On the 17th day, the buyer closes the case and says \"I still have item, however I don't have qr code to send it back\" - there was no qr code, there was just a prepaid label which had to be printed out. Bear in mind, he closed the return case, so I'm assuming I don't need to accept the return anymore? He sent me a message on eBay asking what to do, whether he needs to open another case with eBay. What should I do? How do I reply to him, since I don't think I can accept the return anymore since a buyer can only open a return once. Feel like he's gonna give me a negative - although I checked the buyers profile, and he has never even given anyone feedback.",

I assume that I don’t need to answer or comply with this request since it is well behind the return/INAD window and tracking shows successful delivery. I would like to help this guy out though since he buys from me a lot.

    "text": "Copy of my response from the other subreddit: eBay is by far the best place to sell small parts. After factoring in fees and shipping you will still get the highest prices and best exposure. You may have some success on Facebook Marketplace, especially for larger items. However, that's an extremely frustrating platform to sell on and the prices are generally lower. There are very few eBay sellers that operate in the way you want, and if they do they have obvious restrictions. There's one in my area that does 50/50 profit sharing *after* items have sold and does not pay anything upfront. eBay sellers that buy used parts upfront want to pay as little for their inventory as possible, generally 25% or less of what they think they can sell the items for, especially if they are slow-moving. This is the classic reseller conundrum by the way, you either do the work and get a high price or you sell to someone else quickly for a very low price.",

    "text": "Not sure if I can send this complaint to Riot/Riftbound team directly but collecting cards in general is incredibly frustrating lately. Scalpers are the main issues but the secondary issue is when LGS BECOME the scalpers. There is no reason every single one of my 8 LGS in the area should be marked up to TCGPlayer prices. I have been collecting since 1996, Magic, Pokemon, Yugioh, Dragon Ball, Digimon the works. This day and age, collecting is looked at as a side hustle for a lot of people but LGS/LCS were always the last bastion of normalcy. Gonna throw a \"BACK IN MY DAY\" here, stores we disincentivized if they were caught marking up product past a certain point. Riftbound boxes being around $150/$170ish would be around that markup area. Neopets and WOTC used to straight ban stores from getting products, and still do to this day (Neopets) if distribution guidelines are not followed. I really suggest Riot take this route so Riftbound can be fun and affordable to enter more players hands at a local level. Well what about the scalpers you say? They will just buy out the LGS and relist on TCGPlayer. Do what Japan does. - Box limits per WEEK - Plastic cut on Booster Boxes - Some even go as far as cutting the top of packs on sale so they are no longer sealed. Scalpers hate all of this. What are you gonna do, list 36 picks whose seals are all broken? This game is awesome, I want it to thrive. I don't want it to become the frustrating circlejerk sphere that is Pokemon currently. If people cannot buy product affordably, they will leave.",

By Ben Burrows — January 21, 2026 Share They say a picture is worth 1,000 words ... but sometimes those words come from a different book. When Carlos Beltran was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on Tuesday night, collectors might have started searching for his key rookie cards. Here's the problem: One of those cards, Beltran's 1995 Topps Traded rookie features a photo that is not the eventual Hall of Fame outfielder, but instead is a picture of a teammate who never climbed higher than Class AA. But Beltran isn't alone with this photo error — in fact, he's not even the first Hall of Famer to have an image of someone else pictured on his card. Here are seven baseball cards featuring an unfortunate case of mistaken identity. 1995 Topps Traded Carlos Beltran was elected to Cooperstown with 84% of the vote, but anyone hunting for his flagship rookie card will likely be disappointed. Included in 1995 Topps Traded, the front of Beltran’s rookie with the Kansas City Royals actually shows teammate Juan LeBron, an outfielder who would play 12 seasons of professional baseball, but never reached higher than AA in the United States. According to GemRate, Beltran’s mistaken rookie is by far his most graded card with more than 2,400 authenticated by PSA. PSA adds a designation reading “UER: Juan LeBron Pictured” to each. The public record for the card, according to data tool Card Ladder, is the $1,138 paid for a BGS 10 Pristine examp",

(Credit: The PRyan Collection on Instagram) By Patrick Ryan, as told to Darren Rovell — August 07, 2025 Share Last June, I spent $14,047.20 at Lelands Auctions on an autograph book featuring a bunch of signatures of baseball stars, including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. When I won the auction, my plan was to get each page slabbed. But when I came up to the Ruth page, it seemed like the small signature on the large paper could create a special opportunity. Knowing I was going to be at the \"Sotheby's x Fanatics\" auction in September, and Tom Brady was going to be there, I thought about making a GOAT piece, adding Brady to my Ruth ... and then eventually icons from basketball (Michael Jordan), hockey (Wayne Gretzky) and soccer (Lionel Messi). Ryan had the piece authenticated by PSA with the label \"Sports GOATS.\" (Credit: The PRyan Collection on Instagram At the auction, I won a Jackie Robinson card and sat behind Brady, who didn't win any of the cards. When he got up, I said to Brady, \"Hey, I don't want you to leave empty-handed,\" and I gave him a ticket to \"The Catch\" — otherwise known as Joe Montana's epic pass to Dwight Clark — from 1982. Brady famously attended that historic NFC Championship Game as a kid. Brady said thanks, and I asked him quickly if he could sign an autograph, and he obliged.

(Credit: Mister Mancave) By Darren Rovell and Kevin Jackson — July 17, 2025 Share The Hamilton County Coroner's Office identified autograph dealer Brett Lemieux, 45, as the man found dead when police executed a search warrant into a scheme involving fake sports memorabilia in Westfield, Indiana. In a release Thursday, the coroner listed the cause and manner of death as pending, but in a statement Wednesday, Westfield police attributed \"a self-inflicted gunshot wound\" as the cause of death. A Facebook post attributed to Lemieux on the \"Autographs 101\" group sent shockwaves through the sports autograph industry Wednesday morning. In the post allegedly written by Lemieux, he detailed a huge counterfeiting business that sold more than four million items and surpassed $350 million in sales. The crux of the autograph forging operation was based in faking holograms of the largest companies in the hobby, including Panini, Fanatics, Tri-Star, James Spence Authentics, Mill Creek Sports, GT Sports Marketing and others. Lemieux’s primary business was called Mister Mancave, which says on its website that it offers “the largest framed jersey inventory on the web.” A Facebook page for Mister Mancave says the business is located in Columbus, Ohio, but no records of a physical store there exist. Mister Mancave has been incorporated twice in Indiana between 2018 and 2023. In the post attributed under his name, Lemieux said after Kobe Bryant died in January 2020, his company pu",

(Credit: eBay) By Darren Rovell — December 03, 2025 Share A ticket to the first leg of the first Triple Crown will sell Wednesday on eBay, with a chance to beat the all-time record for a horse racing ticket. The ticket to the 1919 Kentucky Derby, which saw Sir Barton win in front of a then-record crowd of 50,000 fans, had reached a high bid of $30,058 as of Wednesday at 10:30 a.m ET, less than 10 hours ahead of the auction close. That price is higher than Sir Barton’s ownership received for the win that day ($20,800), albeit not factoring for inflation. \"It's exceedingly rare and arguably the most significant Kentucky Derby ticket a collector could own,\" PSA's chief ticket authenticator Matt Fuller said. \"The PSA pop on this is only two, and I was lucky enough to see both of them come in.\" Sir Barton was a co-favorite to win the race, but he had not posted a single win in his six career starts. He did a big advantage, however — the horse weighed 4 1/2 pounds less than any other horse in the field. The record price paid for a horse racing ticket was $45,600 for a full 1937 Kentucky Derby ticket, the first of three wins by War Admiral. The record paid for a Sir Barton piece of memorabilia is for the Derby trophy presented to the horse’s owner, J.K.L. Ross, which sold for $71,700 in 2015 at Heritage. Sir Barton swept the Triple Crown races in a span of 32 days, leading wire-to-wire in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. The three races — the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes — were formalized as a group of races in 1875, but the name Triple Crown wasn’t attached to the",

Too good to be true? Evaluating a press pass from an all-time NHL moment Press pass said to be from Bobby Orr's 'Flying Goal' sells on eBay — but is it the real deal? Bobby Orr's \"Flying Goal\" to win the 1970 Stanley Cup final is commemorated with a statue outside the TD Garden. (Credit: Getty Images) By Darren Rovell — July 31, 2025 Share One of the main reasons I love collecting tickets is because there is great arbitrage value — especially when the buyer knows something the seller does not. Being aware something historic happened at a certain game and then getting that ticket graded could yield a turnaround of thousands of dollars. That said, there are also sellers who know collectors are seeking this advantage and play the game in reverse. A press credential sold on eBay for $76. on Wednesday night. It was listed as \"Bobby Orr 'Flying Goal' Ticket Press Pass 1970.\" Every detail on the press pass needed to be closely examined. (Credit: eBay) Now, Orr's flying goal is one of the greatest moments in hockey history and represents an iconic collectible that I'd love to own. So, I went deep in my evaluation to decide if I should bid on this lot. Let's take it step by step with the questions I asked as I investigated: 1. Does the item appear authentic? The credential certainly looks like it could be an old pass, though the gold color seems to be a little aggressive for the 1970s. I would expect it to be a mustard yellow. The writing looks authentically faded. It has the markings of what would make sense with the game being \"SC4\" (Game 4 of the Stanley Cup final) and it being versus the \"STL Blues.\" 2. Can you make the leap the item is from the game listed? All the details on the press pass are hand-wr",

(Credit: Getty Images) By Darren Rovell — October 14, 2024 Share It turned out to be one of the most fortuitous ticket finds in collectible history. A 50-year fan of the Oakland A's, who missed many games in 1989 as a partial season ticket holder, sold a lot of 13 full tickets from that season for a whopping $40,100 on eBay. The lot featured 113 bids. His combined cost for the 13 field level tickets, 35 years ago? $130! The reason? One of the tickets, from Opening Day of that season, is the first full ticket from Ken Griffey Jr.'s debut that has ever been seen. “I’m amazed at this unexpected bonus in life and at a very timely moment,” the A's fan told cllct about his new windfall. “I have been trying to complete a decade’s long personal photography project, and it looks like funding might have arrived.” The man, who requested to remain anonymous, originally posted the 13 tickets without any description, but after getting offers of up to $7,000 for the lot on eBay, told cllct it was time to do some research. Before posting the tickets, the man said he has cross-checked the dates with highlights from the A's 1989 season — but he hadn't looked closely at the visiting teams. He had moved from Oakland to New Mexico in retirement and had gone back through his boxes where he had stored his tickets to \"clean house\" after relocating. \"I didn't think of money when I was saving them,\" said the man. \"I kept them as souvenirs.\" To date, PSA has graded 21 tickets to Junior's debut, but a full t",

John Riggins broke a tackle at the line and not only got the first down, he rambled for a 43-yard touchdown that put the then-Redskins ahead to stay in a game they would win 27-17. The jersey Riggins wore that day in an 166-yard performance that won him the game's MVP award sold at the Super Bowl LX Live Auction Event for $470,000, besting its high-end estimate by $270,000. The event marked the 18th year in a partnership between the NFL and Hunt Auctions. Riggins, who was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1992, played five seasons for the New York Jets before playing his most impactful football in Washington. Additionally, his Super Bowl ring sold for $105,750 \"For me, without the fans, there was no football,\" Riggins said in a statement. \"You gave me something far greater than anything memorabilia can represent. Knowing my teammates and I helped create moments you’ll always remember is the only legacy I need. Now, it feels right to pass these keepsakes along to the people who made them matter in the first place.\" A portion of the proceeds from the auction will go directly toward charities of",

Cooper ransom money more mysterious than the escape itself On this date in 1980, $5,800 of D.B. Cooper ransom money was discovered Only $5,800 of $200,000 in ransom money was discovered (Credit: Getty) By Darren Rovell — February 11, 2026 Share There are a handful of people and stories that never get out of my head. They are, in order of my fascination: The JFK Assassination, D.B. Cooper, the sinking of the Titanic and the 1962 Alcatraz Escape. All of these have one thing in common: How the hell did they ever happen? JFK is pretty self-explanatory. It's such a deep rabbit hole, because, well, the truth is likely more complicated than we will ever know. The Titanic's makers tempted fate by calling the boat \"Unsinkable.\" But how an iceberg wasn't seen because of a combination of hubris and a missing key to a binoculars case is astounding. The 1962 escape from Alcatraz, was led by Frank Lee Morris, a prisoner with a 133 IQ. Not only did they escape from the inescapable, but substantive remnants of their escape, for the most part, were never found in the water. There's one element of D.B. Cooper has than none of the others have. There was an encore. From November 1971 through January 1980, the only unsolved American hijacking wasn't all that well known nationwide. But when an 8-year-old boy named Brian Ingram came across $5,800 in $20 bills that matched the FBI dossier from the Cooper ransom list, the legend expanded its reach. It also made no sense, which added to the mystery. Ingram found the bills bundled together in a Columbia River beach called Tena Bar. Except Tena Bar wasn't close to the FBI flight path, so, either the flight path was wrong or the money would have had to flow down smaller rivers into the Columbia. But how ",

    "text": "Did PSA house my slab with dust, or my card was swapped? Hey guys, Just wanted to share this here to get some ideas as to what’s happened to my card. I sent off my PF SIR Charizard for grading around 20th November through The Sub Center in the UK, even paid for the card cleaning service too! I got it back a couple weeks ago and noticed that there’s a massive white spec on the back of the card, in the top left that was most definitely not there initially. As well as a blue dot on the white of the poke ball on the back. Both of which were nowhere to be seen when I sent them off. I can’t tell whether they’re two large specs of dust that have somehow made their way into the housing of the slab, or if they are genuine faults (which would mean my card has been swapped out). I’ll attach the imaging PSA took as well as the photos I took of the card pre grading. I’ve since been in contact with TSC, and they have imaging of the card once it was submitted, which I hope they’ll provide soon, but I’m completely left dumbfounded - I wouldn’t submit to PSA with those faults. Let me know what you guys think, or if I’m going mad...😩",

    "text": "PSA up Chargers higher tier, but customers don’t get the benefit of that tier. This will sound a bit annoying because I’m sure it’s been said 1000 times already. And I am very happy that my card got up charged which insinuates its value is of a certain tier higher than I projected... but I’m very annoyed Apologize for the long read, but I do have a question at the end. Summary is, I sent a sub in September (145 days ago), and I FINALLY GOT an email from psa today saying I need to accept up charges of $400 to allow the to finalize the submission. There was no associated value included, just that the card value is above a threshold. So I see I got a psa 10 in the attached sheet. So after accepting I asked for how they valued the card and what the charges were for. They explained that there is one other card in a PSA 10 which sold a month ago at some value which is within this threshold, so we estimated it at that, and charged you for the super express tier since that’s is your cards value. I have two MAJOR issues with this.(edit, accidentally deleted my issues) 1. they charged me for a service I didn’t receive. Their super express has a 9 day turnaround, where my card has a 150 day turnaround. And they used a comp which happened 100 days after my sub to justify their price. 2. They are pricing based on a Pop 1 card, which is now a pop 2, which typically decreases value heavily. Aside from the fact that the card market fluctuates, especially for sports where circumstances change weekly. Note: the funny part is, if I did an expedited grading, or if they did 100 day turnaround time, there would be no comp, and they would have projected it HALF of the value they charged me at as their own app currently values it at half of what they used as the estimate. QUESTION Has anyone ever had this experience and reached out with any success in gettin anything from PSA? I want to call them and explain my stance and see if they could provide anything to me as a person who has sent 10",

    "text": "A little history lesson about card grading, with a current snapshot about the \"Godfather\" People as a species have always been drawn to the \"Get Rich Quick\" idea. Remember the Publisher's Clearinghouse Million dollar giveaway after the Superbowl every year in the 90's? I bet you or your folks bought a magazine or 2 in hopes of increasing their chances of getting on TV live holding a giant check with Ed McMahon. Same thing with the national lottery, the higher the booty gets, the more people participate. Whenever someone asks you if you got your ticket you always respond with the same question: \"why, what's it up to?\" So it's human nature to be eager to grab wealth as easily as flipping a light switch... In 1991 a guy named David Hall decided to expand his business of coin numismatics into the trading card industry. He saw an opportunity to make money that required no capital, no sweat and tears, no inventory. In fact people would line up to give him their money, in hopes that he would grant them the privilege of being able to charge more for a card then the market decided it was worth right out of the pack. He would declare, based solely on printing quality, what \"score\" a card should receive. More about him in a bit. Today Collector's Universe, Inc.-aka PSA aka BGS aka SGC aka Goldin Auctions aka Card Ladder aka well you get the point. Collectors sits at the head of the table that not only decides what a card’s quality is, but where it gets sold, and how much it is now worth as a result. The term “stranglehold” comes to mind when thinking about how much control of the market he, and his clever assortment of companies have today. In fact it's an 80% grasp of the entire industry. That's, well, a problem. So our buddy David is no longer with PSA. But he's not done making money out of thin air. He now runs Hall of Fame Exchange, a company that grades graded cards. That's not a joke. He will take a look at your PSA 10 and give it an additional grade, from “strong 10” to",

    "text": "eBay standard envelope - any way to get tracking updated? Hello, I currently sell on eBay selling TCG cards, most of them only sell for a dollar, but I do have a couple of cards that are a couple of dollars or more that I send out with these envelopes. The problem is the tracking. With the limited tracking, my buyers end up getting upset when the envelope doesn’t arrive in the eBay expected timeframe. I assure them I’ve sent it out, but just in the last week eBay has settled 6 cases in the buyer favor claiming I never shipped it or provided a tracking number. This was about $50 in sales (not much, I know). The envelope doesn’t even come back as being processed, only the shipping number created, so they deny the PIP claims as well. Its not feasible to ask buyers to pay for USPS ground advantage when that’s typically more than the card worth, but I keep having to deal with the hassle of lost mail search and running around eBay support every time a buyer opens a case.",

    "text": "Opinions on raising a complaint Hi all, I recently purchased a copy of keyscape from a seller on eBay who seems to have a good reputation and positive history. For those who don't know, keyscape is a licensed software and transfers require authorization from the parent company Spectrasonics. Now in the listing, the seller explicitly states this copy is good to transfer. I ordered the product around January 20th and it got to me on the 2nd. Since then, I've contacted the seller roughly every 2-3 days just to check if they had contacted Spectrasonics regarding the transfer just for updates and if any info is needed. On the 12th, I decided to reach out to Spectrasonics themselves and inquire about any information maybe they were missing. I even provided the software key as proof of ownership. This is where Spectrasonics informed me, they had no communication regarding the key that they could find. Now, I'm willing to give the seller the benefit of the doubt, they had largely been communicative so far, but enter today, I reached out again on Friday for an update and they tell me today, they are out of the country with their family and not coming back until the 22nd. I don't want to assume they were trying to run down the clock, but it is somewhat frustrating to have been unable to use the software I bought over a month ago. I also recognize the parent company could also just be making a mistake as well. I flagged eBay for a possible complaint and what my recourse was in a worst case scenario but I declined to immediately start the process deciding to give the seller a few more days, but now with the vacation information I am less certain of what I should do. Any opinions are appreciated, thanks!",

I have been selling for over 20 years and have had thousands of sales. I do not accept returns and have never had a problem. Perfect feedback. Today I got a return request from someone who bought a vintage perfume “by mistake”. I asked if the original seal had been broken, because if not, then cool I could still list as NIB. Well of course the buyer (new account, zero feedback!) has sprayed it and says it doesn’t smell right and wants to return it. I know I will probably be forced to accept this request. How much can I withhold as a restocking charge? This is no longer valuable. I can’t sell it on eBay because opened bottles of perfume are \\*verboten\\*. I’m fuming. Any advice? Thanks!",

    "text": "Buyer claims \"Not Received\" despite \"Delivered\" status & paying fees. Am I safe? Hi everyone, I’m looking for advice on a situation with a buyer in Switzerland (I am in Germany). I sold a Funko Pop (around €80) and shipped it via UPS. Since it was an international sale to a non-EU country, customs fees were applied. The timeline: Feb 13: UPS tracking shows \"Import C.O.D. charges have been paid or billed.\" Feb 13: The buyer messaged me privately, very angry about the UPS fees, stating: \"I’ve never had to pay ever import fees for a shipment that is under 150 let alone this one that is 80 I’ve ordered million times from same carrier and Germany never paid that fee.” “I have now paid it however very unhappy with it I would like my money back.\" Feb 16: Tracking officially shows \"DELIVERED\" in Zurich. Feb 17 (Today): The buyer opened an \"Item Not Received\" request, claiming: \"Marked as arrived didn't come... I not got anything.\" The contradiction: In the eBay case, the buyer is claiming they never received the item. However, they explicitly messaged me on Feb 13th confirming they paid the customs fees. Since you usually only pay these fees to UPS upon or for delivery, this proves they were in contact with the courier regarding this package. I've already uploaded the tracking and sent a message in the case pointing out their earlier admission. My questions: Since tracking says \"Delivered,\" am I 100% safe under eBay’s seller protection? Does the fact that they admitted to paying fees on the 13th (matching the tracking) help prove they are lying? Should I just wait until Feb 20th to \"Ask eBay to step in\"? The buyer is being aggressive and said they \"will no longer reply.\" Any advice?",

    "text": "Blurry USPS First-Class Envelope Label Workaround (Mac) This post is just to help those who are facing issue with blurry label for USPS First-Class Envelope shipping label when selling stuff (such as trading card game). After doing 10+ failed printing due to blurry label, I've finally figured it out at least on Mac. When you download the label, you need to re-export it to PDF but with Quartz Filter of \"Black & White\". * Download the label at 8.5 x 11. * Open the label in Preview. * File > Export * Format is PDF. Select Quartz Filter > Black & White. * And save. This will generate a bigger file size, around \\~120kB instead of the \\~87kB original download PDF from Mercari. I never have this problem with eBay Standard Envelope. I don't know why Mercari is being crap here. They could just easily give us a higher resolution shipping label.",

I like everything about them, but is their ai grading too perfect? Will I get a low grade because of the tiniest flaws? I still like tag, but am considering tag v and just to authenticate the cards without grading. Should I consider cgc?

I spend 3 months acquiring cards to buy my first deck, now that deck is so out of meta, and would take me months to build another deck. Is this game even playable? EDIT: thanks for the kind (continuing) responses, this helped me stop spiraling and focus on going out and meeting some locals I am getting frustrated, I posted on the weekly thread for the 4th time, and honestly just crashing out a bit. I'm not rich, I live in Canada, I want a hobby that gets me to local events outside of my house. Everyone told me to look for cheap decks and build off those etc. Fine. I am in Canada. Now I chose teach because I like the character a lot and his crew, and at the time people said it might not be the best but it's servicable. Fine. \"shouldn't cost more than $20-40 to build entire deck.\". It took me months to actually acquire all the cards, and all the prices are wildly more expensive than what I expected. Where I am told a card is 0.12 cents in canada it's minimum 45, and often even 1.25 because every local store in Canada knows I have no other choice. So I end up spending like $100, which includes the starter deck, to build everything except the last 4 cards I needed which I ended up having to order from Ebay as a 4x and it cost almost $40 alone for those 4... now they've been shipping for over 2 weeks from the states. Finally almost here, want to go to local event. Trying my stuff on sim now for weeks and I have not won a single game in 50 games, I constantly get 1 turn from win and lose everytime. I am not that bad, I am a grown adult who can critically think, it feels unfair and no fun. I tried to build a green zoro deck at the same time and every single person told me its cheap and effective. Great. I got all the cards I needed for I'll admit relatively cheap. Then I needed 4x perona and 4xmihawk. Great. Everyone says they're like $2.50",

I got this message from the seller today. Who is responsible for covering the extra cost? It feels unfair for me to pay an extra unexpected cost. I do not follow the news and didn't realize there was an issue with international shipping, shouldn't the seller have warned about additional costs for potential US customers? I get that he spent money trying to ship it, but ebay only charged an additional 20AUD (approximately 14USD) for shipping initially. So how come the seller is now saying I'd have to pay over double that just for him to try again? Any advice would be appreciated.",

Instead of combining the postage and doing 1 big order, eBay has instead listed it as 7 separate orders, each with their own shipping label, therefore, i’d be paying £3 per plate for shipping (therefore £21), instead of about £5-6 if i was to ship them altogether. How can i make it so i only have to send 1 big parcel instead of 7 separate parcels, each of which i’d have to pay shipping on? Thanks eBayUK",

I go through the appeal and note that we purchased all three pairs new from a retailer but I don’t have a receipt from 5 years ago. After a week of silence, I receive an email this morning saying my appeal had been denied. My question now is will I get a hit anytime I try to list a set of AirPods? They’re 100% real so can I just wait a month and list them again? This is the third time I’ve got hit with counterfeit claims on items I know are real. I’ve had my store for about 2 years and it just seems like the hoops are getting harder and harder to jump through. Any advice would be appreciated.",

I’ve had 2 instances in the past where buyers claimed lost packages and I immediately refunded and sent an apology message. Both buyers were receptive and didn’t leave negative feedback. Flash forward to today, I had a sale for an older non volatile FCA card. I searched through all my boxes and can’t remember ever pulling that specific card. I refunded and sent a message but he did not respond and is now leaving a bad review. Am I in the right to try and fight for my 100% rating or just move on since it was my responsibility to make sure I didn’t accidentally list the wrong card. To repeat, this card did not change price from the time of the order to me cancelling.",

    "text": "Buyer asking for refund/return on damaged item - my fault - I will refund but need advice about whether to bother with return So, I sold 11 magazines in a lot. This is low-value stuff - the buyer paid about $10 plus $7 shipping, so $17 total. Now, five days after delivery, with no prior direct contact with me, they are requesting a refund/return, saying that some(not all) of the magazines are not in good shape, and the issue they wanted most in the lot has its body partially separated from the spine. This is all from the return request, I have had no direct contact with the buyer. Now, here's the thing - they're not making it up. The damage they're describing - particularly for that one issue - is real, and I had thought I'd disclosed it in the listing(I always specify any existing damage to items I'm selling). It was my mistake, and I feel like I should take responsibility for it and not make a big deal out of it. So I'm going to issue the refund, but I'm on the fence about whether or not to go through with the return or just tell the person to keep it. It's just that I'm already going to be out the original $7 shipping(that the buyer paid), and that'll be doubled if I pay to have it returned, so I'd be in the hole $14 for an item that, if it sold again, in all likelihood wouldn't get more than $10(before eBay fees). If this was an item that had real value, I'd do the return and not refund until the product is in my hands, but for something like this, I feel like it's not worth it. I know that buyers do this on low-value items and I might be giving the buyer exactly what they want, but I don't see much point in getting these magazines back other than on principle, because they aren't worth much. Plus, looking at the buyer's profile, they sell a lot of these types of magazines, so I'm thinking they bought this stuff in the first place to re-sell, and the damage would make it harder to do so. Just thought I'd post this here before I do anything.",

Hi everyone, I’ve been selling vitamins and supplements (mainly sourced from iHerb) on eBay for a while. Out of nowhere, eBay permanently suspended my account without giving me a clear explanation or any actionable steps to fix the issue. I know this isn’t uncommon I’ve heard similar stories from other sellers. The problem is that I’m now sitting on stock worth thousands of dollars and I’m not sure what to do with it. I don’t want to sell on Facebook Marketplace or Gumtree. I can’t sell them on Amazon. So I’m trying to figure out what realistic alternatives I have. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

The shop owner picked up on it when I bought a 4th copy of same record over a period of maybe 2 months (Edit: I only ever buy new items from him. Never used records). We talked about it. He doesnt bother selling online anymore so he's not super up to date as to what releases become more expensive with time. I def got the feeling he's not thrilled about my actions, but on the other hand I assume he prefers that to them just sit in his store.",

It was his first purchase from me, and when the package arrived in the USA they left a notice at his post office. I contacted him and he went to pick it up and pass fine. After that, he bought the same item again and I shipped it on 24.11.2025. I assumed he had received it a long time ago. I checked the tracking, which shows that our postal service sent the package abroad a few days after I shipped it, and the USPS tracking page shows the same. However, today — after almost 80 days — he opened a case saying he never received the package and that he waited long enough. Very stange as we was in contact frist time when he buy he can contact me all this time and ask anything but he dont do it. This has never happened to me before. Even when tracking doesn’t show delivery, once or twice buyers usually contacted me to say they received the package anyway. So what should I do now? The item was purchased on 24.11.2025, and he opened the case on 14.2.2026 saying it wasn’t delivered. Should I refund him, or what?",

The reason was because the product was recalled. I know for a fact the item listed was not recalled and that AI got it wrong. It is a part that is readily sold outside of eBay (as well as plenty of others currently listed and sold within ebay). Further, checking currently listed and previously sold items, none of them were \"removed for policy violation\". There are also no recall notices I can find and eBay doesn't give any reference for thier finding. So it appears my item just happened to get caught erroneously and has been hidden from buyers until I take action. The message gives me the option to appeal, which I'm temped to do as long as there are no consequences. Pretty sure if an actual human reads the appeal and has any sense, they'd let the item sell. If it gets denied, no big deal, but I'd like to sell the item if I could.",

    "text": "Guardality Safe Card Protection reviews complaints consumer reports: Does it actually block RFID skimming? My 30-day test. Howdy y'all. I'm a 47-year-old sales rep from Houston who spends half his life in airports and bouncing between client meetings. I've got maybe eight cards in my wallet—credit, debit, hotel keys, transit passes. A buddy of mine got his card skimmed at Hobby Airport last year, and someone cloned it. $1,200 in fraudulent charges before the bank caught it. That got me paranoid. I kept seeing ads for this Guardality Safe Card popping up, so I went down the rabbit hole of Googling \"Guardality Safe Card Protection reviews complaints consumer reports\" to see if it was legit or just another piece of plastic that does nothing. **Does It Work?** I couldn't find a formal \"Consumer Reports\" test on RFID blockers, so I grabbed one to test it myself. **Short Answer: Yes, but you have to understand it's about the material, not magic.** It uses advanced RFID-blocking technology—basically a metallic layer inside the card that creates a Faraday cage effect . When you place it next to your contactless cards, it disrupts the electromagnetic signals that scanners use to steal your data . **The Feeling:** The card itself is ultra-slim—about the thickness of a regular credit card, maybe 1.1mm . You slide it into your wallet next to your cards and honestly? You forget it's there. No bulk, no weight. That's the point. **The Test:** I was skeptical, so I did a real-world test. Before using Guardality, I held my work badge (which has RFID) up to the reader at my office—beep, instant access. Then I put the Guardality card behind it and tried again. **Nothing.** Dead silence. The reader couldn't detect it at all. That's when I knew the shielding was real . I've been carrying this in my wallet for the last month everywhere—airports, grocery stores, crowded stadiums. * **Peace of Mind:** The biggest win. I don't flinch anymore when someone stands close to me in line. * **Func",

I understand it won't be sold, so it's a unique promotional card, so to speak. If you could send me a picture, that would be amazing, and I'd be incredibly grateful. Thanks\" I'm also seeing it being auctioned off in that same facebook group with one ending at $1510 and an ongoing one $650+. My LGS won't take them without a TCGplayer price and I'm curious what's the best path to consider offers? Is a Facebook group the best solution for collectors of these kinds of cards? These are all foil with the bonus Neheb. Thanks!",

    "text": "Quick PSA + Clarifications + Current Pharmacy Turnaround Times Pharmacy Turnaround Times Update: SmartScripts is currently experiencing longer turnaround times due to elevated order volume from the last couple of weeks with the storms and the recent orders. If timing is important to you, Hallandale is the faster option right now. **PSA: Read this before you submit your intake. Your selections are final once you check out.** Hey everyone, just a quick heads-up for anyone new or about to place an order, since this caught a few people off guard recently. Once you complete checkout on your intake form, your selections are final for that order. That means no pharmacy switches, no plan changes, no cancellations, and generally no refunds after submission. The reason is that this is prescription treatment. As soon as you submit, your intake is transmitted to an independent licensed provider for review. If treatment is deemed appropriate, a prescription may be issued and sent to the selected pharmacy very quickly. At that point, the process is already in motion. Before you hit submit, please take a moment to carefully review: \\- Your treatment selection \\- Which pharmacy fulfillment option you chose (Hallandale vs SmartScripts) \\- Monthly vs quarterly plan \\- Your medical history answers A quick review during intake can prevent issues afterward. The one exception is if a provider determines treatment is not appropriate based on your medical history. In that case, your order will be canceled and you will receive a full refund. If you notice a mistake before completing checkout, you can fix it. Use the back button inside the intake form in the upper left corner. Please do not use your browser's back button, as it can cause the form to glitch. We hope this helps prevent confusion and frustration. If you have questions, feel free to ask.",

Auctions were smooth as butter, all cards sold at market or above. My only complaint is receiving payment from psa and stripe. Its godawfully slow. I mean like 1970s processing slow. I dont know if its PSA, Stripe, or ebay. My guess its Stripe. But if they dont immediately improve this process. Id be better off auctioning them myself. But other then that I would strongly encourage everyone to utilize this method over selling to PSA, or even vendors. I personally feel this market is going to turn into a competition of who's paying the highest %.",

Now I see that many cards sold on Feb 6th are still in \"payment processing\" status. A couple switched to SOLD already (even from later days) but I cannot seem to find a \"guideline\" for that. Did PSA Vault changed their policy regarding payment processing timeline? I seem to remember someone reached out to support and got a specific answer (i.e. payment is processed xxx days after item shipment or something like that). I am all for quick payments but what really matters to me the most is having clear info (if the new standard is a certain number of days so be it, but I can't find a info anywhere in their pages).

    "text": "New to selling on tcg player, some questions I couldn't find answers for Feel free to skip to the bottom. I know this is posted regularly, and I understand the usual advice. Ive sold on ebay in the past but only ~30 cards. Thinking of getting into tcg player as a way to reduce the size of my collection not in decks and move cards from packs I open for fun. I do already work 50 hrs a week so dont really want to be putting more than ~ 10 hrs a week into it. My initial plan is to pull a fatpack worth of cards under $5 and list them to get a feel for it. Once I get my collection down to reasonable selection (I'd have to sell around $9k in cards) I'd only be selling what I open from packs. I dont really want it to take over my free time with sourcing collections and such. Questions: What is the lowest value card you think is worth selling? How many cards should you list for it to be worth it? If I don't plan on maintaining the store long term, is eBay a better option? How long does it take you to list, say 100 cards? Or how many cards can you list per hour? Is there any advice you see here iften that you disagree with?",

    "text": "Price discrepancy of Drake Maye Silver Prizm PSA 9 on eBay Being a huge patriots fan, losing the Super Bowl really hurt. That said, I figured it would be a great opportunity to try to pickup up some Drake Maye cards at a “discount” from a crazy high prices from the past couple of months. So I started monitoring sales of his Prizm silver cards PSA 9 on eBay and I noticed a significant discrepancy in prices. All the cards in the screenshots are from sales today. Does anyone know why sales range as low has $189 to high as $292 despite all ending on the same day and all were auctions. Any clue? Are people trying to find the “best” cards and crack the for regrade? Thanks in advance for all replies.",

    "text": "Looking for Alpha Testers Hey all! I'm working towards launching a subscription-based MTG marketplace with **zero transaction fees**. Instead of taking 10-15% (or more) of every sale like TCGPlayer, you pay a flat monthly rate and keep 100% of your profits. The goal is to even have free basic memberships for those with limited inventories or who just want to track their collection. **Why I Built This** I used to own an LGS and I've sold cards on WhatNot/TCGPlayer so I understand the overhead nightmare and how brutal those marketplace fees are when you're trying to run a sustainable business. I've also spent years buying, trading, and selling cards on Reddit and a variety of FB Groups... I know first hand how easy it is to get scammed, the headaches of verification, and the overall risks. The goal is to bridge that gap: offer the safety and tools of a professional marketplace without the fee structure that absolutely kills people trying to sell/trade. **What You're Currently Paying** (TCGPlayer fees) * $1,000/month in sales = $100-125 lost to fees * $5,000/month = $500-625 lost * $10,000/month = $850-1,025 lost * $25,000/month = $2,125-2,562 lost With a flat subscription, you keep all of it. **Core Features** *Inventory Management* * Bulk upload and management tools (CSV and popular export formats) * Automated pricing for singles and sealed products (TCGPlayer, CardSphere, CardKingdom, CardMarket, eBay data) * Condition-specific pricing rules and global discount controls * Location tracking (for stores with multiple storage locations) * Tagging system for custom organization * Real-time inventory sync across all sales channels *Selling Tools* * Private storefronts with custom branding * Auto-generated item descriptions * Buy list management for stores * Trading functionality * Verification tools for buyer/seller trust * Order management and fulfillment tracking * Integrated payment processing * In-store kiosks for brick-and-mortar shops * Square integration for inven",

Everything properly sleeved, protected, shipped with tracking, and handled professionally. Yet I’ve had buyers send photos of “empty envelopes” and claim the card wasn’t inside — even when tracking shows Delivered. And despite doing everything correctly as a seller, you can still be forced to refund. That means: • The card is gone • The money is gone • Shipping cost is gone • Fees are gone • And your time is wasted There is effectively no real protection when a buyer claims the package was empty. A tracking number isn’t enough. Delivery confirmation isn’t enough. The seller carries all the risk.",

    "text": "Enough of these ‘card price’ BS updates and how about a scalper performance update? Headline: Do not buy Booster boxes, and overpriced cards. Do not fall for these new financial posts from scalpers. What the data suggests right now (Feb 2026) (I will highlight in bold interesting points) \\- Sales have not stopped, but they look “thin” on the top chase cards. For example, on PriceCharting (which states it updates prices based on listings that sold on eBay and other marketplaces), some **Fusion World chase cards show \\\\\\~1–2 sales per week volume.** \\- **There’s clear evidence of price inflation vs reality on certain listings.** On one chase card page, PriceCharting shows a big gap between an “eBay price” and a “TCGplayer price” (and then lists recent individual sales). That kind of spread is exactly what you see when listings get pushed up aggressively but the market clears at more varied levels. ￼ \\- Recent sold comps look volatile (**not a smooth upward trend.** For another chase card, the recent eBay sold entries shown include multiple sales in a short window at very different prices (example range shown roughly around the low hundreds up to the high hundreds depending on the specific sale). That pattern usually means the market is being set by scarcity + **speculation rather than steady collector demand.** \\- **Cardmarket “price trend” signals can show sharp cool-offs after spikes.** One Cardmarket listing snippet shows “From” pricing far above the “Price Trend” number (example: “From: 499,99 €” while “Price Trend: 109,90 €”), which is a classic “asking got silly, trend reverted” shape. ￼ So... are DBS prices slowing down, and was it scalpers? Best read based on what I can see: For the hype items (chase alts, markers/promos, manga-type product), it looks like scalpers/speculators definitely played a role in pushing ask prices up quickly, and the **market is now more selective, with patchy volume and wide spreads between listings and sold comps.**",

I want to buy local every time I can, but when I use their sites they don't have an option for mass entry. I can filter TCGPlayer or ManaPool to show me a specific seller, but I can't use mass entry to only look for cards from that seller or sellers. So regardless of which site I use, I still have to look up every single card by hand. In commander this is especially painful. Any way you folks know of that will let me mass enter a list of cards and check that list against my LGSs stock? Thanks in advance.",

The seller gave the reason of not being able to fill that many cards in TCG’s required shipping time. This question isn’t a simple google request. There is no answers on Google. My question is: Does anyone here know and recommend any sellers that will accept large bulk orders of singles in TCGPlayer for cents per card? I spent hours putting together an order than was declined in minutes. I prefer not buying random bulk as I’ve had very poor luck on duplicates and poor quality cards e.g., dirty, proxy cards, damaged in various ways, etcetera.",

    "text": "Most Expensive Graded Fusion World Cards (Feb 2026) The latest iteration in my “Most Expensive Fusion World” series: here are the most expensive GRADED Fusion World cards as of February 2026. I’ve done away with categorizing cards by set number as that only invited confusion and trolls, so the above represents the totality of Fusion World, including all booster boxes, Energy Markers and both Manga Booster Sets. Set and card number are indicated, as well as grade received (and from which grading company). Under the cards you’ll find the price the card was sold at, which does not include tax or shipping, as well as the sales date. All sales are from eBay. I also note whether the sale was sold at auction, at the listed price, or if a best offer was accepted. In the interest of keeping variety, I’ve included no duplicate cards in the list, (otherwise the list would just be a bunch of FP-001 sold listings ranked by sale price, which might be an separate and interesting future assignment). The only exceptions to this are FB01-139 and FB06-120, which both appear once as a BGS 10 Black Label and then once as a non-black label PSA/BGS 10. I found this to be a good illustration of the difference between a black label and a regular 10 for the same graded card. As always this is for informational purposes only. If it’s not useful or interesting to you, feel free to move on. **I’ve decided I may just start blocking folks who want to constantly rehash the “people like you are ruining the hobby” argument, when all I’m doing is reporting objective price data. That way they won’t ever see my hard work again which they claim is useless information to them in the first place**. But to the rest of you, enjoy, and happy to discuss anything shown here.",

Basically the house always wins but once in a while may get something back, but you’re really paying for the entertainment. So we played and we weren’t going to pay for a whole team but toward the end they grouped several teams together (not sure what that’s called) and then you could buy a 1 of 10 positions - basically sharing with 9 other guys. I have no idea how they divide the cards if something in your group gets something. But I saw the charge ($20) hit my Apple Pay and then saw after the cards broke that I had something waiting to be mailed (or to get a mailing slip...something) Then this showed up in the mail. I couldn’t find something exactly similar (21/25) but the 3/3 cards were asking for a lot. So hoping to break even. But it was fun but I still don’t know exactly how it worked because we didn’t buy a whole team.",

    "text": "PS Vita dev kits - PDEL-1001 Hi all, I have a few of these dev kits and I had planned on holding onto them but situation has changed and I need to reduce my collection size? Is there any interest in them? If so I can take more pictures. I would rather a true collector get them rather than put them on eBay for some company to buy. Other then to take a picture I have never taken them out of the box. I won't reply to DMs, if you have questions/ comments post them here. Thanks! UPDATE Feb 9th: Question for you all, should I try to plug one of them in and power it on? These were in the original box they were ordered in (dec 2014) so they have never been plugged in. Second if the battery is not good should I swap the battery before listing? Also what system do you use to exchange devices? I was thinking just post on eBay and then post the link here? Also a NIB has not been sold for many years and all the sales I could find in the last few years have been used ranging from 600-900. so what price should I list these at? Claude is suggestion 1k-1.5k so is $1.2k reasonable? I am selling these cause I need the money so I cant just give them away. UPDATE 2: If you are a Developer then you can message me or post below and we can work out something. include links to projects you have worked on. Update 3: I have tested all 3 and they work. I took pictures and a video of them booting.",

    "text": "New player, I want my first deck to be slivers! I am completely new to mtg, im 23 and remember all the way back to middle school when a kid was playing some kind of blue colored mill deck, and at some point talked about how awesome slivers are. Eventually I asked my dad for my birthday for some slivers some time shortly after I saw that kid playing. For my birthday I got the sliver overlord, hivelord, gemhide, the poison one, and the blue swimming one (i forget both of their names). I never once played any matches, but the cards were cool and I still have them! Now my buddy recently got into magic, and in turn he got me into magic. Both because they're fricking cool and for nostalgia reasons I want to make a sliver deck. Ideally a really good one. We want to play commander format, since he has a commander LOTR deck. From what ive read, slivers are better off as a commander deck than standard anyways so yippee. What I want advice on is what is the best way to go about getting a 100 card sliver deck? Ive looked on ebay, and there are quite a few prebuilt decks for around 300-400$. Ouchie thats a lot of moola for a newbie. Im not stranger to spending lots of money on things I dont need, but is there a better way to go about creating the deck I want? (Granted idk exactly what I want, I just want as good of a sliver commander deck as I can get) Should I just buy each one as singles instead of a prebuilt? Wouldn't that get even more ridiculously expensive because of the shipping costs on 100 individually shipped cards? Also, I kind of want to have more than just the 100 cards. Say I buy a prebuilt for around 300-400$, that's still only 100 cards, many of which are just lands and some generic spells or artifacts anyways. So maybe I could try to collect multiples and get as many uniques as there are. (the hive must grow so to speak) I understand some specific cards like sliver queen may be super pricey. I also understand that slivers may not be a top tier deck at all anymor",

    "text": "Childhood binder, are these worth something? Hey Reddit, I hope this post is allowed in the sub. I’d really appreciate any help or guidance! I’ve pulled out my old binder from childhood and think there’s potential value in these nine cards. I quickly checked a US price chart website for the holo cards I have, but all the prices are in US dollars. The central card seems like it might be worth a bit, but there appear to be two versions. Mine doesn’t have the Japanese text, but I’m struggling to find a good UK price. What’s the best way to sell these and price them correctly? I’m in the UK and was thinking maybe eBay is the only option, or should I try to find an event nearby to take these to? Anything else I should look for to ensure what I have are legitimate? E.g. the Pichu card seems to be a lighter shade of blue on the back bs the others? Thanks! Edit: Ok... thank you Reddit! This is kind of mad... I genuinely thought I might get some feedback of having a few hundred pounds there and just stick them on Ebay, not quite the scale some people are now suggesting. will be buying some sleeves and \"top loaders\" asap! I'm also sticking to the advice of ignoring my DMs for selling these for now until I understand what I'm actually sitting on.",

    "text": "PSA Vault Holding Card Hostage Back in September I sent this card as well as about 40 others to the vault and sent in a big grading order as well from a PSA staffed drop off event. Long story short I’ve been trying to list this card on eBay via the vault. I thought it was a glitch so I tried on a few different days but it wouldn’t go. I reach out to the vault who within 12 hours respond saying that the card was damaged in shipping and I should talk to my mailman about the damage. I said no- my cards were checked for damage at the drop off event by PSA staff and shipped in to the vault by PSA themselves. The card doesn’t actually look damaged if you see the pics but if it is then they need to fix it, their shipping, their insurance. I waited a few days for a response but nothing came, I wrote in again and nothing. I calle customer service, the rep agreed with me and said they would try to get it expedited. Nothing. Original request to them was Jan 19, response Jan 20th. Now it’s Super Bowl Sunday and I have a PSA 10 rookie auto /10 of one of the team stars and I have no card, in hand or on eBay. Moral of the story, don’t use the vault- they have complete shit customer service and don’t use drop off events for vault shipping, because apparently PSA doesn’t know how to safely ship items.",

    "text": "Mastering the Collectibles Chain: GameStop’s Vertical Strategy I want to propose my two cents on what I think could be \"something that really has never been done before within the history of the capital markets\". This is what I'm titleing Mastering the Collectibles Chain: GameStop’s Strategy. I want to explore GameStop as a future integrated collectibles, custody, and financialization platform, sitting at the intersection of physical assets, digital ownership, valuation, insurance, and liquidity. The core idea is simple: GameStop dominates the entire collectibles value chain. It becomes the infrastructure layer for collectible value itself. It isn't just a retailer anymore. So GameStop shifts from retailer to asset platform. The recent move into graded collectibles and power packs looks like a gimmick, but they can be more of just products. Collectibles are financial assets. These components can be combined to create automated, transparent, and interoperable transactions, in case of GameStop, it becames the infrastructure itself. The important part is this: GameStop is no longer just selling inventory. It is redistributing value. Once a company does that, the next logical step is to own the system that defines, stores, insures, and revalues that value over time. Graded collectibles (PSA 8, 9, 10 etc.) already behave like semi-financial instruments. They have standardized grading, trade on secondary markets, have historical price data, sensitive to condition, scarcity, and demand, globally recognized. What they lack is institutional infrastructure. GameStop will acquire the necessary infrastructure. GameStop is uniquely positioned to collapse all of this into a single stack. The PSA is the keystone. If you control grading, you control authenticity, condition, market trust, value boundaries. GameStop does not need to immediately acquire PSA. A deep strategic partnership is enough at first. GameStop stores already are physical intake points, customers drop cards locall",

It is going through Ebay's authenticity guarantee verification per the normal process, my question is does anyone know what will happen? Will PSA still authenticate the slab and seal it with an authenticate sticker, will they send it back to the seller, or send it to me the buyer without the sticker saying they can't authenticate? I understand there is no way they will authenticate the signature, which is fine I don't really care. But will they authenticate the slab and card itself? If anyone knows please let me know, being the idiot I am, only thought about this after I paid, and the slab already enroute to PSA authentication. Thank you",

Buyer opened return saying item not delivered. ebay didnt allow me to respond as it was a shipping matter, and I had used simple delivery by eBay. My account was then suspended by ebay for suspected fraud and my funds are to be held until July 2026. In the meantime, the item was delivered, and ebay closed the case in buyers favour then deducted the funds from my eBay balance. This was in the same morning. I've tried appealing the suspension but they denied me. Called and tried to appeal the return, but they said as im on suspension, all cases are closed in the buyers favour. What can i do from here? The item was about £150 and eBay is holding £768 of ny funds til July.",

    "text": "I built a free tool to fill those annoying empty slots in your binders (and save ink) Hey everyone! 👋 Like many of you, I have a \"WIP\" binder that is full of gaps. I hate staring at those empty pockets while I wait to find the singles I need. I wanted a way to fill them with placeholders so the binder looks complete, but I didn't want to waste a ton of color ink printing full proxies just for a placeholder. So, I spent my weekends building a standardized tool for this. It’s called **Binder Placeholders**. It’s **free** and open to the community. 🔗 **Link:** [https://www.binderplaceholders.com/](https://binderplaceholders.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=launch_post&utm_content=r_pokemontcg) **What it does:** * **Printable Proxies (Eco-Friendly):** Generates perfectly sized card images. The \"Minimalist\" mode (my favorite) creates a clean, white card with just the Pokémon name, number, set symbol, and rarity—looks professional but uses zero color ink. * **Art Mode:** If you do want the full artwork for visual impact, you can simply toggle that mode on. * **Smart Binder:** A digital 9-pocket page editor where you can drag-and-drop cards to plan your layout before moving physical cards. * **Master Set Tracking:** Quickly browse sets (using TCGDex data) to find missing cards. * **Graded Slab Tracking:** If you have cards that are graded (PSA, BGS, CGC) and sitting in a slab box instead of your binder, you can mark them as \"Graded\" in the app. It will generate a special \"Slab Placeholder\" card for your binder that shows the Grade, Company, and Cert # so you know exactly where that card is. **Why I built it:** I absolutely love the E-Reader era and I'm currently slowly grinding my way through **Skyridge, Aquapolis, and Expedition**. Since those cards are harder to come by (and often graded), I needed a way to visualize the inevitable gaps in my binder without it looking empty. I’d love to hear what you think! Does it help with your organization? If you",

    "text": "eBay prices I'm having an annoyed morning and wanted to open this to discussion. For context, I'm 42M games industry exec aiming to collect the full NTSC NES set, loose. I'm far into this journey and good at pricing and understanding variability where it's deserved. And I'm not talking grails here, I'm talking sub-$100 titles that are regularly available. My core issue: many sellers are adding their assumed eBay costs into the list price so that it nets them the \"value\" of mean price charting value. But the fallacy is that mean eBay price is based on what it sold for on that platform, the actual value is maybe 60% of those prices. B&M shops get away with selling for these prices outright because they have legitimate overhead and convenience, plus an assumption of service and reliability. Also, anytime can walk or and say \"I'll just buy it on eBay\" if the price isn't met or beat. But if you're selling on eBay, the price IS the PC price, and your net is whatever's left of it after eBay is done taking their cut. And within that is a spectrum of variable value based on the actual quality of what you're selling. You don't get to sell an okay condition torn label monster for the mean price on PC plus 30% to \"cover your costs.\" Anyway, really over, would love to hear some opinions.",

My ability to work requires significant accommodations. My working with local employment office and the state disability employment office is lackluster so far. Yes, I've been applying for jobs. I have an upcoming CPA appointment because I likely fudged up my 2024 taxes and need to make sure my 2025 taxes are done, so that's 400+. The refund I need because its about the only cash I will have. Public Assistance will cover my food but doesn't even cover my rent (its only about 80%) Applying for HEAP is a pain due to a roommate situation. The only thing I can start doing is selling stuff. I have put this off because its not sustainable, people want to buy something for nothing, and it counts as income for Public Assistance, so it ultimately undermines my entire Public Assistance package. I'm trying to remember what I have and what I'm willing to let go in this first round. The stuff I have, I may have spent thousands of dollars on, but for selling its worth hundreds at most. In the mean time, I started shifting things over to my credit card as I'm trying to avoid paying my CPA with a credit card as that transaction will count as a cash advance, and I have 0% APR until September. I know it's a bad decision and I already have a balance, but I gotta float myself as long as possible in hopes I can find a job myself or the organizations that I am working with can help me find a job. At the end of the day, how do you budget money to last forever? My first SSDI application was denied and I found a way to make money so I disqualified myself in the first place. Its super easy to be gainfully employed when you can charge $75 an hour.

Last year, I was on Fanatics Live and on an impulse, bought the Braves in a 2 box ‘24 Topps Diamond Icon for a fair amount. It took 4 days to get down to the last few teams. They had to serial one due to the price then it was down to just the Nationals. The Nats were discounted several times over 6 hours and no bites. I offered 50 dollars for the laughs but they took it. 😂 The chat thanked me for “taking one for the team.” The break finally begins. The first box he pulls a Randy Johnson First Inscriptions card and the chat is excited and the host seems to be mildly amused and moves on to box 2. The third card he pulls causes his face to look like he’s going to puke. Here’s the pulls from the 20 cards total 😆. Which leads me to the question.....there’s not a ton of data that I can find.

I pointed out every detail that you can easily identify. They need to have a department that looks into claims better. I also see a ton of sellers selling fake silver and gold even us currency. They wont delete or take any of those serious. Ebay is using AI to determine if these are fake and they dont even have an option to get a human to look into it.",

I had a card on eBay (through the vault) that someone put in an offer for that I accepted almost a month ago. Clearly they waited to see how he did in the playoffs before deciding to pay, since they have 10 days to do so. He didn't do well. They didn't pay. It's now almost 4 weeks later from the day I accepted. It's still stuck in the eBay \"no stock left\" status. I've watched the PSA offer go from almost what the buyer offered to 40% less (though it went back up now it seems). No response from PSA. They are officially broken.",

The 2026 document is mostly a **clarification, tightening, and regulatory-alignment update**, rather than a new payments model. Think *same engine, stricter dashboard*. # Key differences (old → new) # 1. Effective dates & rollout clarity **What changed** * The 2026 version spells out **two separate effective dates**: * **5 Feb 2026** for *new sellers* or sellers explicitly accepting the terms * **5 Apr 2026** for *all other sellers* **Why it matters** * Much clearer enforcement timing; fewer “I didn’t know this applied yet” grey areas. # 2. More explicit regulatory framing (UK/EU focus) **What changed** * Stronger, more frequent references to: * FCA regulation (UK) * CSSF oversight (Luxembourg) * Anti-money-laundering (AML) and sanctions screening * Clearer language around **DAC7 tax-reporting–driven payment holds** **Why it matters** * Confirms that **holds, reserves, and account reviews** may occur *purely for regulatory reasons*, not just seller performance. # 3. Holds & reserves: same powers, clearer explanation **What changed** * The mechanics of **payment holds** and **rolling/minimum reserves** are largely the same * The 2026 version: * Explains *why* holds happen more explicitly * Gives more concrete examples (risk profile, disputes, delivery delays, tax compliance) **Why it matters** * No new penalties — but **less ambiguity** if funds are frozen or delayed. # 4. “Specific Payment Methods” tightened **What changed** * The 2026 terms expand and clarify **chain assignment**: * Buyer uses BNPL / invoice / direct debit * Seller’s receivable is automatically assigned through acquirer → payment partner * Stronger confirmation that: * Y",

Things have really changed so I have been spending a lot of time reading do's and don'ts. I want to be prepared before jumping in feet first. Thanks to this sub I learned that funds are held for 21 days, which is perfectly fine, I get that. My question is...items that have been paid, shipped and reviewed, can you use those funds for shipping? Meaning will ebay use that instead of taking the money out the account you have set up?",

Even during the worst of times around 2022 assembly was always a step that took a week at most. How does it make sense that I send a 5 card sub through Gamestop on the bulk tier and it takes 2 months, but I send 2 cards myself in value plus and it takes even longer than that I know they are the busiest company and grade a lot more cards than the 2nd but these times are honestly ridiculous. The fact that gamestop subs take less time than Value Plus completely killed it for me. I cancelled my PSA subscription and will only do GameStop from now on, makes no sense paying $150 a year to get treated purposefuly worse than the gamestop submissions I hope something is being done to throw these times down. This submission originally had an estimated finish date of 12/31. Then it got moved to /2/3 (today) and it obviously wont be done anytime soon Disheartening, disappointing, and just makes me not want to sub again. I know this is just a sob story and everyone is going through the same thing. But it really shouldnt just be accepted as the norm. Hope something changes",

Spent days on end tinkering, trying apps, setting up launchers, getting meta data, installing apps and pushing the thing as far as I can with HD packs and the like. The thing is, now I have pretty much everything up and running, I find myself not really using it. I think I enjoyed the tinkering and problem solving of getting things to run, such as gamehub/ gamenative games, project Zomdriod, the 3ds HD packs and Wii U controls for Mario Galaxy. Now most things either run well or I've hit a wall where they aren't likely to according to various community sources, I find myself going to play something much as Pokemon ZA on Eden or FF Crisis Core on Gamenative and end up just switching to my MSI Claw, Switch 2 or PS5/ PS Portal as generally the MSI handles emulation better or being Windows can just run the games without needing emulation and obviously the PS5 and Switch 2 play things without issue. I love the duel screens, but at nearly 44, outside of nds, wii U or 3ds, I don't really use both unless I'm reading a guide while trying to sort something out as I don't have the brain power to play a game and actually take in anything in a meaningful way other than what's on the top screen without pausing. So I'm wondering, now the tinkering is done, is it worth hanging onto for anything outside of 3DS emulation and smaller form factor than my Claw. The prices for them on Ebay here in the UK are going for around the price I paid for it or more and I'm just worried that now I don't seem to be using as much, it will decrease in value as the batches get shipped out and I'll lose money if I decide to part with it in the near future. Anyone have any hot takes to talk me into/ out of selling?",

    "text": "Since when eBay applies US VAT to UK sales in the UK? The item is listed in the UK from a UK seller from which i have been buying many times, how come after the auction ended this shows up and instead of £185 i have to pay £222? And yes, i did ask ebay, they are investigating Edit: After speaking to a few representitives and a manager the problem became obvious. Apparently the seller can list items with price without VAT and the listing itself will say that 20% VAT will be added on top of the price. After checking the sellers listings now it shows on all of their listings that 20% VAT will be added. I am pretty sure that wasn't there 2 days ago but it's a very small 1 line text that i could have missed. To be clear, when you open the listing nowhere it says that 20% will be added, only in search. During the bidding process there is not a single line saying you have to pay 20% on top, there is no mention from eBay nor from any visible place. I have been buying for more than 10 years and from this seller, I have never seen VAT charged separately on [ebay.co.uk](http://ebay.co.uk) Anyway, this is ridiculous, i will be getting a mark on my account for non payment and the seller decided to block me from buying from them instead of understanding that the change they made might be upsetting to people when it's not obvious at all and there is no warning.",

    "text": "Price Discrepancies for TCGPLAYER vs. eBay I sell cards frequently across eBay, reddit, and facebook marketplace. I recently sold the Gold Mega Charizard Ex 130 from Phantasmal Flames on facebook for $515. I crossposted it on reddit as well, and was downvoted to oblivion by salty users, saying tcgplayer market was $348 and that my item was overpriced, despite selling for ask within 15 minutes of listing and had multiple ready buyers at $515. This post is a disclaimer for buyers and sellers to explore more than one way to comp their items as I've often found tcgplayer's algorithm for determining market price is often laggard to the accurate market sales. It's very often that I'm \"lowballed\" by those choosing to go based off tcgplayer as reason to price their items and I want those to avoid using that as the golden standard for pricing. Most LCS use tcgplayer pricing as well. **Card (NM copies)** |**tcgplayer** |**AVG of last 6 sold** |**pricecharting (eBay)** |**AVG of last 6** Mega Charizard X 130 |$350 |$377 ($27 difference) |$450 |$445 ($5 diff) Team Rocket's Mewtwo |$376 |$406 ($30) |$403 |$425 ($22) Umbreon 161 |$840 |$957 ($117) |$999 |$1073 ($74) Giratina V 186 |$658 |$598 ($60) |$570 |$559 ($11) Dragonite V 192 |$394 |$371 ($23) |$358 |$350 ($8) Mega Charizard X 125 |$637 |$712 ($75) |$784 |$886 ($102) As you can tell, the difference between market price and last 6 sold for tcgplayer is much greater than ebay. This data was not cherry picked, i just chose popular modern chase cards off the top of my head. I included the Mega Charizard SIR to show that \"market\" on tcg is $637 but there's sales today on eBay at $1000 raw. Often only one sale every few days, compared to eBay's multiple daily I would personally choose to comp based on eBay as there's more sales volume as well as actual images. The centering of a modern card is heavily weighted into the card's price and this is taken out of the equation for tcgplayer, thus leading to lower sales prices. Vintage be",

    "text": "I see a number of posts lately that all have some form of the following statement: “Why should I keep buying from my LCS when their prices are higher than Walmart or Target?” Let’s break it down. From basically the beginning of card shops in the 70’s, those card shop owners all got business accounts with the various card companies. At first, just Topps/Bowman/OPeeChee. Then later Upper Deck/Leaf/Panini. Like almost all “retail agreements”, they entered into a contract where they got “X amount of product” at “X amount of money” per case. Per their agreement, they would sell at an agreed upon MSRP. Those were the rules. As long as you followed them; you kept your allocation and good standing. That was pretty much how it went until 2020. That’s when the COVID boom happened; and all the sudden the sleepy little hobby that hasn’t been mainstream popular since the late 90’s, became extremely relevant again. Once there’s money involved; the big players will figure out a way to exploit the situation. Enter Fanatics. In 2021, they secured the rights and licenses to be the exclusive producer of cards for MLB, NFL, NBA and a few smaller sports. Essentially ending Panini’s reign. The problem was, they had the licenses, but they didn’t have any way to actually produce cards. Enter Topps acquisition. In January of 2022, Fanatics purchased Topps Inc for around $500 million. This now gave them the infrastructure, brand name, and immediate rights to MLB, MLS, UEFA, Bundesliga, F1 & more. They also bought some smaller brands (like Mitchell & Ness), to help co-brand apparel and trading cards. We’re now in 2026, and Panini is on its last breath. Their NFL license expires in April, which will then give Fanatics 100% control of all major sports. . . . . . . . . Ok cool? So what does that have to do with my LCS and their high prices?!? Glad you asked. \\[and for the record, this is direct knowledge from two local card shop owners who I know very well, and have let me peek behind the curtai",

Alot of them are duplicate cards. I decided to list around 10 per day through the vault on ebay for the next 7 days with a $0.99 auction start. Market value is around 350 per psa 10 with around 7-16 sold daily according to cardladder, ebay sold, and Pricecharting. My goal with this was to get closer to 87% per sale instead of PSA buyback offers of 72%.

GameStop is sitting on **$8.8B–$9B in cash**, has a CEO with a **$100B incentive structure** (scaling in $10B tranches) to reward performance, and a strategic **Bitcoin Treasury**. Between the eBay \"**Whale**\" thesis and the \"**Trio**\" roll-up (PSA/Funko/Newegg), RC is building a conglomerate. The **Oct ’26 Warrants (GME/WS)** are the surgical tool for high-leverage ROI, protected by a Board-controlled \"Extension Joker.\" # 1. The Financial Fortress: $9 Billion and a Bitcoin Floor As of late January 2026, GameStop’s balance sheet is an anomaly in the retail world. **\\[1\\]** * **The War Chest**: With \\~$9B in cash and liquid securities, GME is no longer defensive. It is a predator. This cash generates hundreds of millions in interest alone, ensuring consistent profitability even before a single game is sold. * **The Bitcoin Factor**: In 2025, GameStop moved to diversify its treasury into Bitcoin (averaging \\~$107k/BTC for 4,710 coins). **\\[2\\]** While BTC has seen recent volatility (consolidating around $79k), it provides a \"Hard NAV\" (Net Asset Value) floor.

The first tranche only vests when GME hits a $20 Billion Market Cap and $2 Billion in cumulative EBITDA.

If you search any popular modern card, you can see very few sales of TAG, but for some reason they are selling at similar prices. One of the shadiest things about TAG is their social media campaigning. Buying/sponsoring out popular influencers (DeepPocketMonster, RocketCollects, etc), sensational social media reels, etc is it possible that they are buying out overpriced slabs on eBay to look more \"presentable\" or as a legitimate competitor to PSA?

Many hardcore players go to this site - in addition to ebay - to purchase or even sell their cards. It was on track to surpass ebay to become *the* place to grab sealed product and singles. Well rewind 2 years ago and ebay bought tcgplayer. Now there have been some growing pains from the merger but nonetheless, ebay has \"let\" tcgplayer operate generally the same as it did before the purchase (which is a good thing). So if there is an M/A of ebay on the table, then GameStop effectively has reach into tcgplayer, which is HUGE and might be something non-TCG apes may not realize. Buy. Hold. Trade. Moon.",

    "text": "Why do I feel like I'm the only one who has to follow the rules? I buy and sell trading cards like many people and I've made thousands of sales. A chunk of them - buying and selling - have been on eBay, but it seems like I am the only one that has to follow the rules on that platform. When I send in an offer on a BIN price, I get a pop up that tells me exactly how much my credit card will be charged if the offer is accepted. The moment a seller accepts it, my card gets charged and the transaction is finalized. However, more and more frequently of late, someone will send me an offer on a BIN listing that I have up, I will accept it and..... nothing. It just sits in limbo. It's not listed under the \"Awaiting Payment\" section but, if I go to manage offers, I see it's listed as \"pending\" and has a grayed out \"awaiting payment\" logo next to the price. Nothing ever happens and that's it. No sale. On auctions, when I bid on something, I also get a popup telling me what I will be paying, and that all bids are binding. The auction ends and, if I win, my card gets charged a couple hours later and that's it. Deal is done. However, when I set up my own auctions, people will bid on my item, win the auction and..... nothing. No payment. Nothing. It just sits there. I've had this happen six times in my last forty auctions. I even have the settings in my seller dashboard to restrict people with \"non-payment\" marks from bidding on my items. I do not want them..... yet I always seem to find them. How is it that all my bids and offers are \"FINAL\" and everyone else's seem not to be? Are there more settings that I'm missing? Does eBay just not give a shit?",

Where would be the best reliable place to bulk buy a bunch of cards that are common? I like the idea of making my own decks, and while I do plan on buying some precons, I would love the ability to just search through a collection and make something. I assume I could just go on maybe ebay or something for them (ngl I've never used ebay so I'm unsure if this is reliable). I do have some shops near me, but when I went they seem to just have binders which was nice for picking out a few cool cards. I just want a bunch of good common cards that should be in most decks! edit: sorry I think I used the wrong flair, I do not post often on reddit 😬",

I hear you and completely understand your concern regarding the delayed payment for a sold card in your Vault, and I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and concern this situation has caused. The delay is due to a technical issue that we’ve been actively working through with our internal teams and our payment partner, Stripe. Please know that we hear your concerns and are very sorry for any frustration this may have caused. We’ve made a temporary operational adjustment to payout timing in coordination with eBay. During this period, payouts from eBay sales may take up to five business days to process after the buyer submits payment. Once the payout is released, please allow an additional one to three business days for the funds to fully process and appear in your bank account, depending on your financial institution. We understand how frustrating delays like this can be and truly appreciate your patience while this temporary adjustment remains in place. Please note that PSA Partner Offer payouts are not impacted and continue to process within one to two business days. If, after this timeframe, you still do not see the payment reflected for this card, please feel free to reply directly to this ticket and I will be happy to look into it further for you.

It's an amazing set from a hotel in La Grande, Oregon circa 1925. We're located here in the Pacific NW and the only local antique dealer interested in the set is asking us to name a price. I have no idea if I should be asking $200 or $2000 for it. They include 46 Meyer China pieces, 10 R Wallace silver soldered pieces, and 7 glassware pieces. All are in near-pristine condition. More information on the history of this china and the hotel can be found at [https://rwcn-idwiki-2.restaurantwarecollectors.com/content/la-grande-hotel/](https://rwcn-idwiki-2.restaurantwarecollectors.com/content/la-grande-hotel/) What's a reasonable price?

    "text": "eBay Authentication discarded my lawful accessories without clear consent — seller didn’t opt in I’m posting this as a heads-up to other sellers, not a rant. I sold an authentic designer handbag on eBay. The bag itself passed eBay Authentication with no issue. I did not request authentication — the transaction was automatically routed into the Authenticity Guarantee program by eBay / the buyer. Along with the bag, I shipped handmade leather replacement straps. These were: not counterfeit not branded lawful personal property packaged separately disclosed as non-original accessories After authentication, I was notified that while the bag passed, the handmade straps would be discarded and not returned to me. At no point during listing or checkout was there a clear, prominent disclosure that lawful accessories could be destroyed without compensation. There was no checkbox, warning screen, or affirmative acknowledgment explaining that this could happen. Any reference appears to be buried in fine-print terms. I understand authenticators removing non-original items from the shipment — but permanently discarding seller property without a return option (even at seller’s expense) feels like a disclosure and consent problem. I’m sharing this so other sellers know: Do not include replacement or handmade accessories with items routed to authentication Even if they’re legal and disclosed, they may be discarded You may not have opted into authentication, but you’re still bound by its terms",

Now that's a pretty limited run these days. Well surfing the net and watching some YouTube vids has shown me that Backyard Breaks had 50 cases, or 10% of the entire print run. Filthbomb was given a similar allocation, so now we are at about 20% of the print run without factoring in a single other breaker that gets allocation from Fanatics. Single boxes are so limited on the secondary market that they are going for 5x. There are a grand total of 23 available to purchase on eBay at the time I'm writing this. Call me a doomer - I don't really give a shit - but this is why you couldn't get Black & White or Bob Ross. And when you cant get those, and you don't want to pay 5x guess where you're gonna go - to the breakers. EQL or not, this is why these products are sold out in less than 5 minutes. Get used to only buying low end products or be a part of the problem and feed the breakers. When I can't get my hands on a case of Platinum Chrome Anniversary Fanatics I will officially be 100% vintage. Good luck everybody.",

I’m looking for some insight from anyone who has received a card from eBay’s Authenticity Guarantee. I sold a high-value raw Pokemon card ($600+) and took every precaution shipping it to the authenticator. I used a USPS Priority Mail small box, lined with foam and packing paper, with the card securely protected in a sleeve and card saver between two foam pieces. The card was rejected for \"Listing Accuracy.\" While I understand their standards are strict, I feel the need to specify that I didn't hide anything about this card. I specifically called out a small surface dimple on the back border in the description and included a dedicated close-up photo of it. When it arrived yesterday, the mailer was torn and had visible punctures. Even worse, the inspector’s notes were contradictory: they verified the card is 100% authentic, but then added a note saying \"please update your listing to reflect that the card is altered.\" I pulled this card from a pack myself and have not modified it. I'm not sure I understand why they believe it was altered. Maybe because they didn't like the small surface dimple, but I had already disclosed in the listing. It seems okay upon first look, but I'm stressed that a $600 card was treated so carelessly by the people paid to protect the transaction. A few questions for the group: 1. Is it normal for eBay to basically downgrade shipping from a box to a mailer on returns? 2. Has anyone else had a pack-fresh card labeled \"altered\" by an eBay authenticator? 3. If I find any damage upon closer inspection, what is the best way to hold eBay/the authenticator accountable since they discarded my original protective packaging? Appreciate any advice or shared experiences.",

    "text": "I sell sports cards and use eBay’s standard envelope. I’m now being threatened because of it. This might be the last straw for me. Like the title says, I sell sports cards on eBay. As of this morning, I’ve sold $13,488 in the last 90 days. Of that total, a pretty large number of cards are $20 or less, and they ship with eBay standard envelope. I charge my buyers $1.89 to which I pay $1.32. The additional 57¢ covers my material and time. If you believe eBay, their standard envelope takes 3-5 business days to arrive. It also claims to have tracking so you can follow your order. So that’s what a lot of buyers expect. Now let’s talk about reality. On average, my ESE deliveries are talking about 10 days for most people. Some end up taking up to three weeks. Some don’t ever arrive. “Tracking” is a complete joke. It’s not scanned by USPS at any point. They work with some third party, and the only times they \\*might\\* get scanned are via a sorting machine at specific hubs. As well as being a pretty big seller, I’m also a buyer somewhat regularly. I just looked, and of the last 10 cards I bought with ESE, only four of them showed as delivered. The other six, per eBay’s “tracking” would be considered long lost at this point. If I was a miserable human, I could very easily claim they never arrived, and force the seller to refund me. Even though the card is 100% in my possession. Now let’s talk about the threat. I received this email from eBay this morning. (Sorry for having to copy/paste, I can’t add a screenshot) . . . . . . . . . “Dear Seller, We wanted to remind you that your seller performance has consistently fallen below our minimum standards in the United States.

I have a pile of various cards to grade from various sets and promos but I am having trouble deciding from a purely financial POV. My black label contenders will obviously be going beckett but for my clean but perhaps not perfect cards Im having the below pros and cons. TAG: Pros - 30 business day turn around,value seems to be competing with PSA on bigger slabs and theres a Pristine chance. Cons - Not as liquid as PSA and am not sure of value across the whole range of cardd. PSA: Pros - Easily most liquid, guarenteed value. Cons - Turnaround, upcharges. I think TAGs look better but that doesnt really matter when selling to market as PSA still is trumps. What are peoples thoughts? Im leaning towards TAG due to the faster turnaround, no upcharges and the chance of Pristine which seem to be selling between psa 10s and BLs but would welcome some advice/conversation.",

    "text": "Vault and eBay In September I went to a PSA submission event at Real Sportscards in Champlain MN, mind that this is a direct PSA event with PSA employees present taking grading and Vault submissions. I did a drop off for a 52 item grading order and submitted another 40ish cards to the vault. PSA was in charge of all packaging and shipping of the vaulted items. Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago when I try listing a PSA 10 Jaxon Smith Njigba Panini Legacy Rookie auto pink/gold /10. It won’t list, try it again, it won’t list. Try again the next day, still doesn’t work. I reach out to the vault to find out what’s up and I get a response in about 12 hours. Vault employee tells me the card was damaged during transit to PSA and that I should talk to MY mailman. Uhm no... this was a submission that was transited by PSA from an event, damage insurance coverage is on them. He also sent me a picture of the supposed damage. The card looks exactly like it did in its grade reveal... so #1. I don’t believe that it is damaged at all and that it is just coded wrong and they’re not pulling the card out to actually look at it. I wasn’t notified of any damage when my cards were vaulted. So if it was damaged and couldn’t be sold why would I want it to continue to be in the vault? #2. If it actually is damaged, the rep says specifically in the message that it looks to have been damaged in transit - the cards were all verified prior to the submission with a rep who closely examined them and actually gave me back several other cards he determined to not be eligible for the vault due to damage. So similar to how they force place insurance on us via premiums above the regular fees, what insurance does PSA have on things they ship from events? Compensation is due if the damage was caused by their shipping method. Right? #3. It really sucks to have a vaulted card that could easily bring in multiples of its predicted value due to the Seahawks now going to the Super Bowl. It’s a /10 PSA 10 r",

    "text": "I got tired of using 5 different apps to price cards for my shop, so I built my own AI-powered alternative. (Beta Access) I own a small card shop in the UK (Devon based!), and for years I’ve been frustrated with the \"pricing shuffle\"—switching between eBay, a calculator, five different pricing apps, and static price guides just to give a customer a fair price. It was slow, and half the time the data was lagging or inaccurate. So, I decided to do something about it. I’ve spent the last few months building **Price This**—a fully AI-powered intelligent market pricing system. **What makes it different?** **1. The \"Ultimate Average\" (Base Layer):** We don't just guess. We pull data from **PriceCharting, CardMarket, TCGPlayer, and Google results**, extrapolating and averaging their market prices to establish a solid global baseline. **2. The AI & Real-Time Intelligence (Top-Spec Layer):** Once we have that baseline, we apply our **Human-Reasoning AI** and **Official eBay Partner Data**. Instead of just using \"Yesterday's Data,\" the AI detects changes in real-time. It filters out \"wash trading,\" shill bids, and outliers. It \"thinks\" like you do: *\"Oh, one just sold for this much? It's from this set, this era, holds this popularity... therefore the real-time price is THIS.\"* **3. Kiosk Mode:** A feature I built specifically for vendors/traders. You can visualize a trade live, input cash vs. trade credit, and let the app calculate the mathematically perfect deal. **4. The Vault:** Tracks your profit, not just value. See your buy-in cost vs. current value and get volatility warnings before a card crashes. **I’m just one guy building this.** We aren't a massive corporation. It’s just me and a friend, building this for the community. **We launch Early Access on Feb 1st.** Most of the app (including the AI pricing) is free. If you join the beta now, you get a **Founders Badge** and a permanent discount on any future Pro features. I’d love for you to roast it, break it, and tell ",

The problem is that the card arrived with an ident mark on the lower border that wasn't on the listing pictures or description. Seller claims it wasn't there when shipped but is offering a 50 USD refund. I don't grade usually, but in my opinion the proposed refund seems low for such a significant mark.

I'm not really good at valuing these things, I don't really collect anything at all, and don't understand the pokemon market as a whole. Really just the fact that we're at peak hype of Pokemon, especially with the 30 yr anniversary coming up. Do you guys have a general idea of what a set like this is actually worth? Is it foolish to try and buy it given all the hype right now, should I wait for it to die down and circle back in a couple years? Where else can I find complete sets like this?

I didn’t really plan to sell them but they are at prices I sort of can’t say no to. What is the best way to sell these safely while maximizing sale price? I had debated going to collectacon in Miami at the end of February, but not sure if it’s better to sell on ebay? I have had issues selling on ebay recently with people reporting packages never arrived and having to refund them so I am a little wary. Plus they take 13% of the sale.",

    "text": "Questions for Frequent Graders Have a color blast, kaboom, maybe a few smaller pieces I am thinking about grading. What service do you use and why? Do you have any recommendations/insight? (i.e. send in bulk, pay for premium service if \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_) For SSPs and other valuable cards, I hear PSA is known to have pretty hefty upcharges for 10s. I've heard anywhere from 200-600. Insane to me. Feels very anti-collector to force somebody to pay more for the same service, especially when they may not intend to sell. Despite how maliciously vile and despicably greedy that is, I'm curious if that's ever a deterrent for you, whether you plan to sell or hold or PC no questions asked. The Kaboom just looks so clean and, if i'm getting premium service to avoid waiting 6 months for my card, then I have to pay 500 bucks just to get it back, i'm gonna be annoyed because I also have some fascination with the BGS black slab, and apparently they don't have that kind of fee. Any other drawbacks/benefits of BGS? Because it seems like PSA is the standard for sports? I see more BGS respect from TCG friends, but rarely see videos/comps of BGS slabs moving. And then I hear about all this PSA drama with the cracking slabs, employee scandals, fake grades, holding company acquiring BGS, yards-yadda-yadda... makes me think, damn, so they all corrupt? maybe i should just get one of those clear TAG slabs lol they look way cleaner than PSA. prob gonna get 7s anyway idek",

Just go with PSA as they allow some minor imperfections and won't take you from behind for not perfect centering that imo isn't even relevant for the condition the card is in but BGS weighs it just as much as it does the condition. It's just not worth it, the math is actually quite simple. Look at this poor f*cker getting 85% of his submission he waited 3 months for back as 9.5s of which most likely would've graded a PSA 10.",

    "text": "Built a price tracker for our precious stuff we collect, looking for feedback Hi guys! I've been collecting for a while now (meteorites, trinitite, some strategic metals) and got frustrated trying to figure out what fair prices actually are. You have to check like 5 different dealer sites, dig through eBay sold listings, find random PDFs from metal traders. Pain in the ass. So I built a site that pulls it all together. Tracks rhenium, gallium, rare earths, meteorites, tektites, LDG, trinitite. Basically the weird stuff that doesn't have a nice clean market price anywhere. It's free, no account needed to browse. If you make an account you can log your holdings and track what your collection is worth over time. Still early and I know there's things missing. Would genuinely appreciate feedback from people who actually care about this stuff! What materials should I add? What am I getting wrong?

At first I started in ebay but it wasnt great, bidding takes days, cards are usually more expensive than Card Ladder and Price Charting prices, plus it could be a scam. Then I tried GameStop website. As a \"Pro\" member (25 USD a year) You get 5% off every card and 2% in points for future cards. And surprinsingly to me most cards are priced just at what Card Ladder says then with the 5% off and the 2% points back I get a good price. I am sending them all to the PSA Vault so no taxes either. I gotta say it makes the whole process frictionless. and has me checking periodically for new ones. I do have like 10 enhacements I could suggest them but its good enough. 🚀",

    "text": "One of the most popular complaints I see in the Hobby involves folks saying some form of “breakers get all the products”. Then, a hobby simp or Fanatics burner account will always chime in with “Fanatics has a public presale where you can always buy boxes at MSRP!” Is that \\*technically\\* true? Yes. However, my main question is what’s the actual allotment put aside for the public? My theory is that Fanatics releases an EXTREMELY small number of boxes for the general public. I’m talking less than 5% of the total available inventory. It’s the one and only way you can explain how EVERY SINGLE RELEASE “sells out” within 90 seconds. Fanatics wants you to believe it’s because millions and millions of people are flooding Topps.com or Fanatics.com and buying tens of thousands of cases. I think it’s because they release an extremely small amount of actual cases in a public release. That way they can pretend “everyone” has a fair shot at regular pricing, before the aftermarket monster takes hold and suddenly you’re paying 50% to 125% more for the same box. Then, after they offer all their preferred breakers a case or two at MSRP... they come back a week later and say “you’re entitled to another two cases, but now they are \\*market price\\*. Which means even breakers are now paying a 50% to 125% markup, which much like tariffs, those costs are passed on to who? You nailed it. The consumer. 2025 Topps Cosmic Chrome is a perfect example. Fanatics had a “presale” at $335 a box I believe. Now? They are $625-$700 on all resale sites. I don’t even care that Fanatics is shady as fuck with their pricing. They’re a business. They can do whatever they want. What I wish happened, was that much like the lottery or casinos... they had to be 100% transparent about everything. That way if they are only offering ten cases to the public, and then 10,000 cases to breakers... at least we know. And at that point can make a much better decision on what, if anything, we want to buy. And make no mist",

It has eBay's \"authenticity guarantee\", but it is seems suspiciously cheap (£1.9k/$2.5k), and the seller has relatively little feedback (95%+ positive). There's no explanation given for the low price. I'll keep it honest. If it is fake/frankenwatch, I won't know, so I would be entirely reliant on the authenticity guarantee. This would be my first pricey watch so I'm not feeling very confident. I did some brief research comparing the guarantee compared to, for example, Chrono24. I'm feeling very conflicted. How would you approach this if you were brand new to watches? Thanks!",

They made $14,000 in sales (after eBay fees, before cost of goods). My bank account was linked but eBay never paid out. eBay suspended my account in January 2026 before any payout. **Current situation:** \\- $14,000 in sales (Dec 2025) \\- Account suspended (Jan 2026) \\- Funds still held by eBay \\- Never received a single penny in my bank account \\- Friend says he can't pay me and will only pay \"once eBay releases the funds\" \\- Research shows eBay can hold funds 180+ days on suspended accounts **Questions**: 1. Do I owe taxes on the $14,000 for 2025 even though I never received the money? 2. How do I handle this on my tax return when the funds are still held? 3. What if eBay never releases the funds? I don't have invoices for cost of goods (friend was supposed to provide them but hasn't). I'm in Canada if that matters. I'm really stressed about owing taxes on money I never got.

Unfortunately, my reintroduction was through breakers on fanatics as I was unaware of how problematic breaking was (please don’t yell at me! I am now aware of how bad breaking is for the hobby and will not be breaking with card breakers going forward). Anyway, I got a decent hit off a case break. I got the card yesterday and it has damaged in the corner. I didn’t notice any damage on the live stream, nor did the streamer indicate that the cards in the case were damaged in any way. There was no damage to the shipping from what I could tell. The damage is to one corner of the card, and my guess would be that it was damaged while the breaker was loading the card based on how the corner looks. Anyway I messaged the shop that I purchased the spot in the case break through about the damage. They asked what they could do to make this right and I said send a comp card or refund my purchase entirely. They instead replied by saying they can send me an empty card package for the particular case and I can send it back to Topps. They said that they receive cards that are already dinged up, which I can understand. However, I don’t want to risk submitting a claim with topps for a damaged card because if they deny my claim I will be screwed, especially because I have 30 days from date of purchase to raise any issues with an order on fanatics live. Anyway, just looking for some advice from those that have dealt with receiving damaged cards from a break on fanatics live",

    "text": "Best Sports Card Scanner App I've Found – Baseball Card Values, PSA Grading Estimates & More Been lurking on this sub for a while and always see people asking how to value their collections. Last month I inherited a shoebox full of my dad's old baseball cards from the 80s and 90s – we're talking hundreds of cards with no idea what's junk and what's gold. I spent hours manually searching eBay sold listings before giving up. Tried a couple apps but the recognition was hit or miss. Then a buddy at my LCS mentioned SnapCard and honestly it's been a game changer for organizing everything. **What I actually like about it:** * **The sports card scanner is stupid fast** – just snap a photo of any baseball card, basketball card, or football card and it identifies it almost instantly. Saved me so much time going through that shoebox. * **Real-time price guide pulls from actual sold data** – not just random asking prices. It aggregates from eBay, Goldin, Heritage Auctions, and PWCC so you're seeing what cards actually sell for. * **The PSA grading estimates are surprisingly accurate** – I was skeptical about the AI grading analysis, but I sent in 5 cards to PSA and the app predicted 4 of them exactly right (missed one by half a grade). Also does Beckett grading and SGC grading estimates if that's your preference. * **Collection manager actually works** – I can finally track my card collection value over time instead of random spreadsheets. **Cards it supports:** Works with pretty much everything I've thrown at it – baseball cards, basketball cards, football cards, hockey cards, even my kid's Pokemon cards and some MTG cards I had lying around. Basically covers sports cards and trading card games. **Not perfect though:** * Vintage cards pre-1970 can be spotty on recognition * Wish there was a web version for bulk scanning * Some of the market trends data could be more detailed **Who it's good for:** If you're a casual collector with a pile of cards you need to sort through, or ",

    "text": "Any tips for getting out of “3 days post delivery” payment jail. Hi all. I’ve been selling trading cards on eBay for 1.5 years. About a month in after “proving myself” I started getting paid within a day or two of the buyer’s purchase. I maintained top rated seller status until November when I had one transaction count as 7 different defects for and INR case. I battled with eBay to get those defects removed and did prevail, but in the meantime they forced me to wait until 3 days after delivery for payments. This is devastating to my business as someone who averages 1,000 transactions per month and relies on the cash flow. The majority of my sales are low value cards where I have no choice but to send via eBay standard envelope unless I want to lose money by paying for ground advantage. Many times those never actually get scanned as delivered so it becomes a 30 day wait for payment. I tried calling to get it fixed but the service reps were no help and kept stonewalling me. One of them even told me “we don’t just give immediate payouts to anyone. You have to prove you can ship on time.” My service metrics are all great: .11% defect rate, .3% late shipment rate, 100% tracking uploaded in time. Over 12k transactions in the last year. I do get INR cases filed pretty regularly but I always handle it without eBay getting involved at all (except for that one aforementioned sale). Do I stand a good chance at getting the payment status restored after the Jan 20th eval? Has anyone gone through this before and gotten out of it? Currently have nearly $20,000 being held hostage in my funds because of this draconian change.",

    "text": "Jimmy's Pokemon Deal Finder - A site that finds deals on Pokemon cards on eBay A few years ago, I got into Pokemon collecting, and I'd look for good deals on cards on eBay. For each card I was interested in, I'd search the card on PriceCharting and compare the listing price to the valuation from PriceCharting. I found this really slow and tedious so wanted a way to automate it. I wrote an eBay scraper and PriceCharting scraper in Python that would show listings from eBay where the listing price was lower than the PriceCharting value. It output the best deals to a text file sorted by price different percent so I could see the best deals. This worked really well and I used it for a while to get some good cards. A few years later, I'd been making programming projects for my personal website and decided to turn the deal finder script into a website. Site: https://www.jimmysdealfinder.com I got it working and posted it to the Pokemon TCG subreddits and had really good foodback on it (as well as some fair criticism that I've used to improve the site). I monetized it with eBay affiliate links and I'm now making about £200 a month from the site, with a peak month of £530 a couple of months ago. I'm really happy with how it's come along, and people seem to be actually using the site to find good deals. I get about 25 users a day and the average engagement time is around 2-3 minutes. I'm planning to expand it to other collectibles such as retro video games, Magic the Gathering TCG, Yugioh, and sports cards. Let me know if you check it out and have any feedback or ideas to improve the site. :)",

Ain’t no fucking way I’m writing a post like this from scratch, but I do think it’s a good pitch and should be considered. I’m here for good DD, if ai can help, why are we limiting ourselves from discussion? **TL;DR:** Collectors Holdings CEO sits on GameStop’s board for free. PE investors (including Steve Cohen’s family office) need an exit after 5 years. GameStop has $9B+ in cash. The same Steve Cohen who bailed out Melvin Capital in January 2021 may have no choice but to sell Ryan Cohen the dominant force in collectibles authentication. ----- ##The Board Seat That Doesn’t Make Sense (Unless It Does) In November 2024, GameStop appointed Nat Turner—Chairman and CEO of Collectors Holdings—to its Board of Directors. One month earlier, GameStop became an authorized PSA dealer. Ryan Cohen’s board is tight and hand-picked. You don’t get a seat for a dealer agreement. Turner receives no compensation for his board role. He’s the CEO of a company valued at $4.3 billion, sitting on GameStop’s board for free. **Why?** Because when this deal closes, he’ll be one of the largest GameStop shareholders. ----- ##What is Collectors Holdings? Collectors has quietly consolidated the entire collectibles authentication industry: |Brand |Category |Position | |-------|----------------------|-----------------------------| |PSA |Trading cards |#1 globally, 71% market share| |SGC |Trading cards |Acquired Feb 2024 | |Beckett|Trading cards & comics|Acquired Dec 2025 | |PCGS |Coins & currency |Industry leader | |WATA |Video games |Industry leader | |Goldin |Auction marketplace |Premium collectibles | According to GemRate, PSA graded 18.3+ million cards in 2025. **Combined with SGC and Beckett, Collectors now owns 79% of all card grading.** They don’t dominate the market.

    "text": "eBay Royal Mail collection rules? I sell TCG cards on eBay, using the Royal Mail collection service when needed. The price on eBay for collection and drop off is the same price, £2.75. For months I've booking one collection, and handing over any extras to be scanned which were bought as drop off (again same price) so as not to have to have extra collections booked when they're already booked to collect. I also pack a lot of orders late at night, meaning that if I did book collections for the extra orders that come through late at night, they'd have to then be collected the day after the original collection day. I asked my usual postie if its okay to book one collection and hand over the extras to be scanned when he comes to collect in the morning, and he said it was fine. Done this for months. Today a different employee came to collect (they had manager written on their uniform), and stated that each collection costs 30p per parcel (which is the case if booked direct via RM), and they would \"let me off for today\". Am I in the wrong? For eBay this doesn't make any sense to me, being as the price of drop off and collection is the exact same. Happy to be corrected!",

    "text": "Hot Off London: Pikachu “At the Museum” Jumbo Card Release Heats Up—Is This the Next Big TCG Investment? London’s Natural History Museum just dropped a bombshell for Pokémon collectors—a limited-edition Pikachu Jumbo card, available exclusively at their massively hyped “Pokécology” pop-up shop. Tickets sold out in a flash, and from Jan 26–April 19, 2026, lucky fans will get the oversized Pikachu “At the Museum” card as a gift with purchase. Some quick context: * The artwork features Pikachu visiting the museum under a giant dinosaur skeleton, tying Pokémon’s world to real science. * This card is part of the official launch tie-in with the “Pokécology” book and features exclusive museum-inspired merch. * Can’t make it to London? A small number will hit select UK retailers from Jan 30, but no Pokémon Center stock and no regular online sales! * Profits from the museum shop support the Natural History Museum’s charity. Collectors are scrambling and fan forums are buzzing—some praise the art, some groan about scalpers being shut out (due to its size and accessibility), and others debate: Will this be the next Van Gogh Pikachu explosion or fizzle into another forgotten Jumbo? # But wait—is this actually a good investment, or just FOMO? Let’s break it down with a deep dive into the Jumbo card market and what makes this release unique: # 1. The Appeal of Jumbo Cards * Jumbo cards are typically non-playable, oversized promos—great as collectibles or display art, but not for tournament decks. * Standout art and links to notable events (like museum collabs or anniversaries) can make specific Jumbos highly sought after. * Older/vintage and low-print-run Jumbos have started commanding strong premiums, especially when PSA/BGS graded. # 2. Is This Pikachu Worth More Than Face Value? * Rarity: Pop-up event exclusivity, limited time window, and no global web release boost short-term hype. * Charitable tie-in (NHM profits) and cross-branding with a major museum add “story” and displa",

    "text": "A Guide to Expected Value: How to See If a Card is Profitable to Grade Hey everyone. I am planning to do a regular series going through the most profitable cards to buy and grade, but first I want to have a guideline to find the Expected Value of grading a card. I tried to make this beginner friendly, so bear with me if this feels too basic. Anyways... This is a guide to finding the Expected Value (EV) of grading a card. We find that this is one of the most important concepts to buying and grading cards profitably! The idea is that we look for cards where the EV of grading the card is significantly higher than the cost of buying it. While a positive EV does **not** guarantee that every purchase will be profitable, it does mean on average your purchases will be profitable if you’re buying 10s, 100s, or 1,000s of cards. I think it’s important that you guys know, this is *exactly* how we approach buying cards in our business. We have our card evaluation spreadsheet structured to follow this exact logic, and had really strong success in 2025 with a net profit margin of 24% and total ROI on card purchases of 35%. # Finding the Market Values To determine the expected value of any card, first we’re going to look at the PSA 9 and PSA 10 values of the cards. We generally assume that a card will grade as either a PSA 9 or a PSA 10. There’s a few reasons that this works. 1. We buy mostly Ultra Modern cards. These have a very high probability of grading as a 9 or 10. 2. We aim for a minimum of a 25% expected return on investment (ROI) for every card we purchase. This gives us more than enough margin of error to get a couple of PSA 8s or worse and still make profit. You’ll see more on ROI in a later section. You can find the graded values of your cards using eBay’s Product Research tool or market research services like CardLadder. Let’s use a simple example card that we will use throughout this tutorial. * PSA 10 Value: $2,000 * PSA 9 Value: $1,000 * Raw Price: $1,000 # Gem Rate",

New accounts often face limitations, delayed payouts, or even suspensions if the setup is incomplete or non-compliant. Some common challenges new eBay sellers face include: * Account holds during the early selling period * Verification issues with identity or payment details * Listing limits on new accounts * Policy violations due to lack of experience Because of this, it’s important for anyone planning to sell on eBay to fully understand account requirements, compliance rules, and long-term risks before getting started.

To save money from consignment fees compared to directly selling through eBay for cards that are above $100 3. More liquidity. The easier it is to sell, the more likely people will sell their slabs. This could *potentially* raise the value of TAG slabs as they currently sell for around [10% less than their PSA counterparts](https://www.reddit.com/r/taggrading/comments/1o63m3d/charizard_ex_199_tag10_vs_psa10_sold_performance/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Of course, there are exceptions, but this is what I've generally seen on eBay sold listings **PSA gets:** 1. Easy money from consignment fees. PSA's #1 priority, as with any other grading company, is profit. They already accept BGS, SGC, and CGC slabs for the Vault. Adding another grading company to that list wouldn't be hard to implement and the profit margins are huge 2. More PSA membership signups and membership retention I've emailed PSA about this and they said: >Regarding TAG slabs, we currently have no announcements regarding when these will be accepted at the PSA Vault. When and if this occurs, our social media team will make this change public. I figured, if enough people email/poke them about this, they'll see the demand and will eventually make this a reality. I like TAG and I use them for my PC, but a few of my cards I've outgrown and it takes too much work for me in my busy life to sell them myself.

After finding listings for the missing cards and adding them, I went to optimize and my two options contained 43 and 36 cards respectively. I didn't have this problem last time, and TCGplayer was bugging out a lot and refusing to let me add stuff to my cart. Is this a problem with TCGplayer servers or am I doing something wrong?

To those who tried rage baiting or telling me it's a pointless post, might be pointless to you - but there's plenty of others who clearly wanted this to be said. Your rage bait attempts were also pathetic - gotta work a bit harder because unlike you rats, I have thick skin and can handle a bit of abuse without having a sook and reporting you to the admins. I've been speaking privately to Alex about this - and after our conversation, I can admit that my anger towards this group was misdirected towards him. The WTB post, now that I think about it clearly, had no reason to be in the original post - so I have now removed it. I guess I was just finding anything I could to put the admin team down, and I saw the listing (which was directly related to the origin of this post) and pulled the trigger. I won't speak to what he said to me - but I wanted to update you all on the fact that Alex has come to me and asked how he and the group can \\*help with this situation. There is a solution in the works - however reselling will never be banned. As much as I don't like the idea of them (scalpers) having a platform this big to sell on, I've done as much as I can and that's just the way it is. I want to thank Alex for fronting up to the comments below and my messages (I was fairly direct about his admin team's behaviour) as you copped the full front of everything instead of Rhys - the one who SHOULD be responding. \\*help - not completely resolve as the resolution we want is for reselling to be banned, and that's not going to happen. Rhys - after looking at all these comments and seeing all the people you've pissed off and how you've clearly chosen what people to defend in different situations, I think it's time for you to mak",

    "text": "Selling trading cards and using ebay shipping label: what am I doing wrong? So Im not sure if I'm doing something wrong, if post office regulations changed, or some mix of both, but Ive started having a ton of issues from USPS sending my orders back and requiring more postage despite the fact Im using the prepaid ebay label. For context: I have been selling trading cards on ebay since 2016, and started using ebay's labels around 2019. Over the years, every now and then I would get an order sent back saying it required more postage, but since the overwhelming majority of orders shipped no problem I didnt think much of it, especially since my local post office clerks never indicated issues with my packaging. Well, I turned in almost 30 orders at my post office on Friday, and when I opened my mailbox this morning all of them had been shoved in a USPS bag and crammed into my mailbox with a note saying each one required an additional $0.49 to ship. It indicates they arent machinable but I dont understand why... they were packaged the same way I always package them and over 95% ship out no problem, not to mention I send cards through TCGplayer packaged almost same way but with a stamp and never have issues there either. The way I package them: Card goes into a toploader, toploader wrapped in a thin piece of newspaper essentially. Placed in a 7x4 envelope with the label fully taped to the envelope with packing tape. Usually weighs between .6 - .7 oz with a thickness of roughly 1/8\" Is there an issue with my process or were my orders just handled by a disgruntled employee? If there is an issue with my process, what is it and what do I need to do to fix it? Do I need a label maker? Cause I really dont want to have to buy a label maker. Thanks in advance!",

The only hope I have is 200 bucks on an ebay bid, and that's for half the RAM I originally wanted, but that's the current market for ya. I feel like I'm trapped into buying RAM at exuberant prices if I want a new PC in the next 5 years. Any suggestions? Or coping methods besides crying myself to sleep every night? I'll take anything at this point.",

    "text": "Side Hustle – Passive Income via eBay Dropshipping I want to share a realistic breakdown of how I make money online through eBay dropshipping, specifically for those who need a side hustle This is not a “get rich quick” post, and it’s not recycled advice for experts, this is for beginners (which is where most people go wrong). What I do (in simple terms) eBay dropshipping means: • You list products on eBay • You do not hold inventory • When a customer buys, you purchase the item from Amazon and ship it directly to the buyer No warehouse. No bulk stock. No upfront inventory sitting on shelves. ⸻ Why this works • eBay already has 135M+ buyers searching daily • You don’t need ads, a website, or marketing skills • You leverage existing traffic, not create demand • Entry cost is low compared to most businesses This is why it’s one of the easiest online models to enter if done properly. ⸻ My results (context matters) • I currently operate 15 profitable eBay stores • Each store generates $1,000–$3,000/month • This is consistent income, not one-off wins • I also run an agency helping others do the same I’ll attach screenshots for transparency. ⸻ The part most people screw up (and get banned) Account warm-up. This is where 90% of beginners fail. I use a 4-day warm-up process: • 3 days before opening the store • 1 day after the store goes live Skipping this is why people get limited or suspended and then say “eBay dropshipping doesn’t work.” It does work — just not if you rush it like an idiot. ⸻ Costs & setup (real numbers) • eBay Store subscription: \\~$25/month • Listing limits: up to 250,000 items/month (varies per account) • No inventory costs upfront • No ad spend Limits increase over time as the account is handled properly. ⸻ Automation & scaling I use AI + automation software for: • Product research • Listing creation • Price monitoring • Order fulfillment • Stock checks I also use virtual credit cards to keep payments stable and accounts clean.

    "text": "HGA acquired by ucollect. Will they survive to 2027? Hybrid Grading Approach finally moves on by being acquired by [ucollect](https://ucollect.com/) A long announcement in the \"restructuring\" area of the HGA website appeared to be bullish and optimistic about a restart in mid-2026. **But do ucollect/HGA have any moats? (** In business, a **moat** refers to a **sustainable competitive advantage** that protects a company from competitors, enabling it to maintain market share, pricing power, and profitability over time. Like a medieval moat defending a castle, it makes the business difficult to attack or replicate.) In short: I don't think they have any moats, but they talk a big game even though Collectibles and Fanatics are in the room What they do *have*: * Convenience via vertical integration (grade → list → sell in one place) * Lower fees (for now) * Nice-looking slabs and sub-grades * A collector-friendly philosophy Why those aren’t moats (yet): * Vertical integration = convenience, not defensibility. PSA + eBay already functionally replicate this. * Low fees aren’t a moat unless you have massive scale (they don’t). Incumbents can always undercut temporarily. * Strict grading isn’t rewarded by the market without resale premiums and trust. * Slabs, labels, and holders are cosmetic — collectors crack them if liquidity isn’t there. * Direct buyer–seller communication actually *weakens* platform defensibility long-term. * Early “in-house” inventory isn’t real liquidity. What *is* a real moat in this hobby: * Brand trust * Registry lock-in * Price-setting power * Institutional adoption * Deep liquidity PSA (via Collectors) has all of those but ucollect/HGA has none yet. The *only* moat ucollect could realistically build: * Inventory inertia + workflow lock-in (vaulted cards trading repeatedly without leaving the ecosystem) But that requires: * Time * Capital * Volume * Survival and we already know that vaulted cards only works for very expensive cards hich also means ",

Yes yes I know, I can go to the store but sometimes even that fails when looking for specific items or I can’t always get there. It also doesn’t help when there’s constant protests about which stores to support and which ones to stay away from (e.g. Walmart, Target, etc). EDIT; I was NOT expecting this to blow up. I was genuinely just curious as to what people used instead of Amazon if they did stop using it or don’t use it as much. I never said that I was going to NOT use Amazon myself. I also understand that there is no “good” companies to support really and replacing one monopoly with another defeats the purpose. I completely understand if you haven’t or aren’t going to stop using it, that’s fair and everyone has the right to do what they wish within reason. EBay, Costco, Aliexpress, etc are all also very valid. Thanks.",

Location: Texas Hey everyone, recently I was talking with a guy on instagram about trading some of my pokemon cards for some of his sealed pokemon product, we agreed on the trade and I asked him to open it and just ship me the packs inside. He agreed and said I had to ship all my cards to him first and once he verified that received the stuff I sent was correct he would ship out his end of the trade. I was fine with that so I agreed but later my parents found out about the trade and made be block him on all platforms as they believed that he was going to scam me as I have been scammed like this before and the trade value was above $2000. He then messages me on my ebay store threatening me to unblock him or else there will be consequences so I block him again as I do not want to deal with someone who has to resort to threats. He then makes a new ebay account and messaged me today with screenshots that he messaged one of my friends on instagram about me and with screenshots of my linkedin profile threatening to call my job and the local police if I don't compensate him for opening his pokemon box. I offered him to pay him the difference in price of the box sealed vs opened but he only wants the full amount for the boxes which is $800 even though the packs inside are still sealed. My reasoning was that he shouldn't have opened the box in the first place as he didn't even recieve the cards that I would have sent him yet. Shouldn't he have confirmed that I sent him the correct stuff in the trade before opening his product since I was supposed to ship to him first anyway? He says he will file a police report by the end of the week and I do not know what to do please help.",

We sell Japanese / anime collectables I made a post just like this a year ago, here's a link to that post if you want to see the differences between 2024 and 2025. Also has some more context on what we do and what we sell: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our\\_2024\\_sales\\_statistics\\_as\\_fulltime\\_ebay/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Flipping/comments/1hrm8ny/our_2024_sales_statistics_as_fulltime_ebay/) The quick rundown though is we (me and my girlfriend) are full-time online sellers who predominately sell Japanese collectables, of which we import directly from Japan. Mostly obscure, vintage, and rare bits rather than modern stuff you can find anywhere. Most of the time we have over 8000 active individual listings on eBay. Notable statistics: Net Sales: $190,465.79 Profit: $99,167.20 Transactions: 5367 Average ROI: 427.51% All of these number are a touch worse than 2024, but not by much. 2023, 2024, and 2025 all had very similar yearly totals which heavily implies we've reached the limit of what we can make with our current system / setup. This year was interesting, particularly due to tons of changes due to our current... administration. Tariffs were a problem for us, because being Japanese collectable sellers 99% of our inventory comes imported straight from Japan. You'd think it's just a 15% increase in buy costs, because that's what the tariffs are, but it's worse than that. Tons of shipping methods skyrocketed in prices, and many international shipping providers pulled out of shipping to the US entirely. UPS and FedEx both hit you with tons of additional fees alongside the 15% tariffs, often times as \"brokerage fees\". I could go into it but the short of it is... screw UPS specifically. So many issues this year. As well, a lot of panic in the early months of year caused a notable dip in our sales. February was the lowest month we had in years, a s",

    "text": "I recently sold a card for $33.89 and as usual, for something under $50, I sent it PWE. I pack and drop off my orders at the same time everyday so everything is out within 24 hours. When I leave for the post office I mark the PWEs as shipped. The day after I marked this order as shipped, I receive a message from the customer asking if I shipped and what the tracking number was. I informed them that I shipped the order yesterday and that I sent it PWE. They tell me that their mailman is a thief and if it doesn't have tracking they won't get the order. I tell them if they don't get the order by the estimated delivery time, we'll figure something out(I'd make them wait a couple more days and then refund them\"). Today they messaged me with a refund request saying that they don't trust that they'll receive their order since it doesn't have tracking and that they want a refund. It's only been 4 days since the order was shipped and today is a holiday. Do y'all think I should just refund them and take the loss or tell them to wait until the estimated delivery day? I know this is a part of the online seller game and I'm not too distraught about the money cause I'm really only $7 into this card, but I'd like some other opinions on the situation EDIT: I should have said I'm a seller with ~5k sale and I've sent hundreds of orders this size, this way. People almost always get their order and this is the first time someone has overtly tried to scam me like this. I'm going to make them wait and then escalate to TCGplayer before I refund. For the people who are saying I should track everything that's over $20, this business would not be sustainable and no one would sell a large volume of cards on TCGplayer if this was enforced.

    "text": "PSA Vault Withdrawal Experience: Consumer Beware I like the general concept of the PSA Vault. Recently I had a few cards that have been in the vault for about 6 months that I wanted to withdraw as gifts for Christmas—I didn’t think it would be a big issue. However after waiting over 2 business weeks for them to ship my cards I received no confirmation. When I reached out the representative said: *We're currently working through a high volume of collectibles, and most orders are shipping within 14-16 business days of the request. However, this is only an estimate, so it's possible it could be slightly sooner or longer.* I asked for the withdrawal to be canceled (they never even left my vault) and they said yes. When I asked for a refund for the withdraw fee and shipping they said they are both non-refundable. I can kind of understand the withdrawal fee being non-refundable but the shipping fee when the item was never shipped should be refunded. I asked to speak to their supervisor and was stone walled—at that point I’m pretty sure I was talking to AI. (Funny how they hire AI customer support but not AI grading). If a bank or brokerage firm did not allow me to withdraw my funds in a timely manner they would be defunct. PSA Vault not having their logistics together enough to simply ship stored items is insane and really diminishes the product as a whole. I’m very disappointed in the withdrawal feature of PSA Vault and seriously makes me reconsider using them as my default shipping location going forward. I just wanted to let you all know this experience in case you were wondering what the withdrawal service was like. **TLDR: PSA Vault has a terrible withdrawal service and I don’t recommend anyone relying on it.**",

I typically win a few and have been paying for everything at once in the evening before bed. Recently, however, it seems that the PSA Store on eBay has a 60-minute auto-pay enabled. Auto-pay itself is fine, but I need all of the cards I purchase to remain in the PSA Vault. The issue is that auto-pay defaults to shipping the cards to my home. Most of the time I catch it in time and change the option, but sometimes I’m busy in the evening and miss the window before auto-pay triggers, preventing me from selecting the vault option. Does anyone know how to turn off the 60-minute auto-pay? Or have the default shipping option go to my vault? I’ve gone through all of my eBay settings and can’t find anything related to this. I’ve also messaged PSA through eBay and contacted eBay support, but so far I’ve only received generic responses with no clear answer. Thanks!",

    "text": "„Sicher bezahlen“ durchgespielt: Wie ich 90€ verlor, weil ich Arbeitsspeicher eingebaut habe Hallo zusammen! Ich möchte euch eine „lustige“ Geschichte erzählen und das absurde Theater schildern, das sich hinter den Kulissen der „Sicher bezahlen“-Funktion – konkret dem **Kleinanzeigen-Käuferschutz (OPP)** – abspielt. # Der Kauf: Ein solider Deal Alles fing am 19. November an. Ich suchte Arbeitsspeicher und fand ein G.Skill Trident Z Neo Kit (3600MHz, 32GB) für 90€. Der Preis war eigentlich Durchschnitt, auch wenn sie auf eBay zu der Zeit schon für 110€ und mehr weggingen. Aus reiner Gewohnheit dachte ich mir einfach: „Fragst mal an, ob er auch 80€ macht.“ Zu meiner Überraschung kam noch am selben Tag ein „Hallo, alles klar“ und das Angebot wurde akzeptiert. Ich zahlte also 90,29€ (inkl. Versand und der Gebühr für „Sicher bezahlen“) – im vollen Vertrauen auf die Funktion. Ohne Hintergedanken. Alles safe, dachte ich. Einziges Warnsignal (im Nachhinein): \"Konstantin\" ließ sich ordentlich Zeit mit dem Versand. Aber gut, kann ja mal passieren. # Der erste Eindruck: Wie Weihnachten Am 25.11. kam das Paket endlich an. Und ehrlich: Der erste Eindruck war top. Die Originalverpackung sah super aus, die Riegel wirkten optisch wie neu, keine Kratzer, nichts. Ich baue sie ein, schalte den PC an – und zack: RGB-Party. Die Dinger leuchteten wie ein Weihnachtsbaum. Sah im Gehäuse einfach nur schick aus. Ich war mit dem Kauf zu 100% zufrieden. # Das böse Erwachen Doch die Freude hielt genau bis zum ersten Test. Ich habe im BIOS das DOCP-Profil (3600 MHz) geladen, aber das Kit läuft damit schlichtweg nicht stabil. Also Memtest an – und da war es: Ein riesiges, rotes „FAIL“ quer über den Bildschirm. Am Ende waren es 13 Fehler. Nur mit dem langsameren JEDEC-Standardprofil (2133 MHz) läuft es. Leider bringt schöne Optik nichts, wenn die Technik Schrott ist. # Der „ehrliche“ Verkäufer Also Verkäufer angeschrieben. Und jetzt wird es interessant.

You have fingers and eyes that alloeed you to type the post.. Google it for yourself, and if you are truly that incapable, send the damn card in to get graded and complain when you get something you don't want! We don't know what grade your card will come back as, and PSA won't either because they don't do their damn jobs! At that point you just have to CONTINUE gambling, and send it in. Redditors aren't going to help you, and frankly.. 80% of us don't care to anyway because we're trying to look at the collections of people who actually cherish their cardboard instead of posting them on eBay just to get 40% of their profits taken from them anyway. This hobby is nothing but people screwing other people over. Constantly. Again, someone guide me to somewhere where people actually give a shit about the hobby. 😭😭",

    "text": "First time shipping to CGC Hi, I will soon be submitting my first batch of cards to CGC. Apologies if this is a basic question, but I wanted to ask for clarification. The cards I’ll be sending have a total value of approximately USD 2,000–3,000. I plan to ship them fully insured, and CGC will also return them insured. What I am unsure about is how local customs will handle taxes and VAT on the return shipment. Specifically, will VAT be calculated based on the CGC service fees (around USD 350), or on the full declared value of the cards themselves? I would not be able to pay an additional 25% VAT on the full card value, as that tax was already paid when the cards were originally imported. For context, I am located in Europe, where a 25% VAT applies to imported goods. Thanks in advance for any guidance, much appreciated.",

Since I’m charging the buyer extra for the signature. Second question: I know the authenticity badge shows next to the shipping section once the item is posted, but can I see this badge on my draft while I’m writing the description? I can’t find it in the draft. Third question: Should I add an insurance if the package gets lost or also if the customer says they never signed for it. Thank you",

    "text": "eBay authentication issue I recently purchased an Omega watch on eBay with the Authenticity Guarantee. The listing explicitly included multiple (3) strap options and an OEM stainless bracelet, which was one of the main reasons I bought this specific watch at the price I paid. The watch just went through authenticity this morning. eBay confirmed that the watch itself is authentic, but flagged a “listing accuracy issue” and stated that the additional strap and bracelet couldn’t be verified and would not be included in the shipment. They gave me the option to accept it without the additional strap and bracelet, or receive a full refund. The problem is that if I want to accept it and just buy a replacement bracelet and strap, just based on a quick search, looks like it’ll be $600-700. So by accepting it, I’m basically overpaying for just the watch head and one strap. Has anyone else had eBay authentication remove things that were clearly shown and described in the listing? Did you accept the item, return it, or get a price adjustment? This is my first time buying from eBay so I’d appreciate any advice. Thanks in advance",

    "text": "After going deeper on Chrome NBA to see whether haywire sealed pricing and rare hit distribution actually had some correlation, a few people asked if the same approach could be applied to Chrome Update. I thought that was a fair question. Unlike Chrome NBA, Chrome Update does not have the cheat-code Hanger format. It also lacks a single format that has caught fire the way Breaker’s Delight did on the NBA side. That makes this exercise useful in a different way. It helps answer whether the big hits are concentrated in hobby formats, whether Value Boxes and Megas are truly as barren as they feel, or whether there is any sneaky value play that avoids paying up for hobby. **The questions this research tries to answer:** Which formats offer the best rare hit potential across hobby and retail? How many boxes of each format does it take to pull a rare hit? Are Breaker’s Delight boxes actually as loaded as they appear? Is there any realistic value in $40 Value Boxes or $70 Megas? **What qualifies as a “rare hit” here?** 1) **Parallels, autos, or inserts numbered /50 or less, including:** Gold, White, Orange, Black and Red base parallels, autos, and insert parallels, FrozenFractors, Superfractors, Printing Plates, Cupfractors Gold or better, Image Variations Gold or better, Radiating Rookie Autos, Dual and Triple Autos, Legend Autos, Cupfractor Autos, ASG Image Variations Gold or better, and Larry David Autos. 2) **Case hit or tougher inserts, including:** Radiating Rookies, Chrome Home Field Advantage, Helix, Major League Minis, Alter Egos, Exposé, Celebración, Mickey and Friends, and MLB Debut Patches. One important reminder: I can identify frequencies, not name distribution. Odds do not tell us which players land in which formats. We have to assume reasonably even distribution. If 90% of Nick Kurtz Gold autos are seeded into one format, the only way to know is by watching rips. **Enhanced Hit Frequencies** How many **Hobby** Boxes to pull: ≤50 parallel: 2.3 boxes Case hit",

    "text": "eBay Buyer Didn't Use My Insured Return Label An eBay buyer (who has been a **GIANT PAIN**) opened an (false) INAD return, and I provided an insured label for $425. A few weeks later, they opened a case, and eBay issued another label on my behalf (that they're charging me for). The original label was still good, however I suspect she wanted a QR code instead, because she apparently shipped it from a self-serve kiosk. The potential problem is, this other label is presumably only insured for $100. Based on what I understand, if the returned item gets lost or damaged in shipping, eBay generally forces the seller to refund anyway. Is there anything I can or should do? I suppose this is a little hypothetical considering the item hasn't been lost/damaged yet, however I do feel I should be able to insure my returns if I want to. edit: Bonus message history. https://preview.redd.it/ceacx9x91p9g1.png?width=709&format=png&auto=webp&s=27c116f488610236c7d1ec7efcfaffc0d0798e2c https://preview.redd.it/6wkd0bx91p9g1.png?width=694&format=png&auto=webp&s=f863d84a3f95e7c4f28f5edcb3dc0b418637b326 https://preview.redd.it/2wclxbx91p9g1.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=10411673dbc310f1569d65a59f0e8e6169bbd47e https://preview.redd.it/iitnrax91p9g1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc99d5848582c6ec07d7b112a825b8672dac53b6",

    "text": "question about gifting my friend as someone living in the usa? hi! i have a friend i met online who lives in argentina and is not financially well off. for christmas i wanted to buy her some things and send it to her (the process of researching and trying to figure things out took me a couple weeks so.. here we are after christmas 😮💨). i was planning on a dsi, charger, and mario kart game for it. i live in the usa, so the shipping on ebay was absolutely diabolical, and a DNI that matches the payment method is needed for both amazon and mercado libre, and apparently eventually ebay. i'm 18 and have a good paying job but unstable hours plus parents that don't know about me having friends i met online, so i can't spend a crazy amount because i don't want them to see something insane on my bank records and interrogate me about it (but i also cannot afford that)... what am i supposed to do about this if i cannot provide a DNI, or her DNI wouldn't work as it does not match the ID on the payment method? i can't transfer her money directly so that she can buy it herself, neither of us have money sending apps. is there a local business in argentina that sells these things and would be able to ship it to her without needing the DNI and without super expensive international prices? if all else fails, i want to be able to send her a visa/mastercard gift card or prepaid card, but i haven't been able to figure that out either, that was a whole thing in and of itself 😭 if anyone can help me out with this i would be so grateful 🥹🥹",

    "text": "I often point out that the “Hit Frequency by Format” numbers I post (parallels per box, cards per box, etc.) are cumulative averages across all boxes within a format. The more I’ve watched this product get ripped, the more it feels like certain formats, especially Breaker’s Delight, are disproportionately landing bigger hits. We’ve seen some truly absurd cases (looking at you u/blezsportscards). That got me wondering whether the numbers themselves could help validate or challenge that perception across both hobby and retail SKUs. **How I approached this:** Instead of focusing on per-box averages, I asked a different question: How many boxes of each format does it take to pull a “rare hit”? I looked at two buckets: 1) **Low-numbered parallels (≤50 copies)** This includes Gold, Orange, Black, Red, Super, and Frozenfractor parallels, along with those same parallels of Basketballs, Pulsars, Raywaves, and Geometrics. I also included Image Variation and Auto parallels numbered /50 or less. I understand there are meaningful hits numbered higher than 50 (ex: Flagg Blue Auto /150, Flagg Green Image Variation /99), but those apply to only a handful of players and don’t materially change format-level dynamics. 2) **Case Hit or tougher inserts** These include Rock Stars, Let’s Go!, Ultra Violet, Radiating Rookies, Helix, Lightboard Logos, Hidden Gems, Advisory, Glass Canvas, Paradox, Patented, Fanatical, Finals, and Gold Logomen. Using published odds, I can calculate the frequencies of low-numbered parallels and Case Hits without much trouble. What I cannot account for is name distribution. Odds don’t tell us which players land in which formats. If 90% of Gold Cooper Flagg autos are seeded into Jumbos, I can't help you there. The only way to know that is by watching rips. **Quick side note:** Some base Geometric insert and auto parallels are insanely rare. If the published odds are accurate (which I assume is the case because they are consistent), base Geometric parallels of co",

Filed a police report 2. Submitted a missing watch report with Rolex 3. Submitted a missing watch report with Enquirus, Alpha Hands and The Watch Register 4. Contacted watch dealers 5. Got CCTV footage from my building and the bars that we went to 6. Contacted pawn shops in Jackson TN to alert them 7.

The lot of about 60 items sold for $400 plus, but the winner only wants a single item from it for $30. I told him I will not separate it, and he is now asking me to cancel the auction. I already know I will need to block this dude and relist it. If he asked me ahead of time I would have done it smh. My only question is should I make the buyer request to cancel?",

It seems that almost every seller has near perfect feedback, yet this is now my third order in the last month or so where I’m receiving valuable cards ($20+ per), either raw dogged in a top loader, or shoved all into one penny sleeve. Mind you, I only buy NM with the expectation some cards may be closer to LP. I’ve been buying some cards to complete my old collection (Base, Neo, Gym), so we’re talking about cards that are over 20 years old; putting 3/4 cards of that age into one penny sleeve is just showing a lack of care to your buyer.

One answer I found indicates that I would pay less if the seller marks that the card is of USA origin on the form, but I'm not sure if that's true or if I could trust the seller to do that. The card is a great deal and something I've been hunting for a while, so I'm ok paying some amount of tariff I just want to make sure it's not something nuts like 70% or something.

It was long thought that this never went into full production and the only existing example was on display in Nintendo’s corporate office in Redmond Washington. The seller here is a well known whale in the collecting community (meaning when it comes to acquiring items, money usually isn’t an object), and given its relatively low price compared to its rarity and reputation, my guess is he probably found a case or cases of them and has multiple available, and he’s slow dripping them on the market for maximum value.

    "text": "Why has eBay completely opted out of the personalised products economy? I want to start a **serious discussion**, not a rant. Personalised products (custom prints, image uploads, engraved items, made-to-order goods) are now a **huge part of ecommerce**. Etsy, Shopify stores, Amazon Custom, and DTC brands are all leaning heavily into it. But eBay seems to have **completely opted out**. Not just “poorly implemented” structurally opted out. On eBay today: * No buyer image/file upload at checkout * No embedded product designers * No design APIs * No way to pause handling time while waiting for buyer details * Sellers get punished for late dispatch even when buyers delay sending info This makes selling personalised items at scale **operationally unsafe**. You end up: * Chasing buyers for details * Receiving info late * Missing dispatch deadlines * Taking account hits for things outside your control What I don’t understand is **why**. This is not a huge technical problem. At eBay’s scale, basic file uploads + handling-time logic would be trivial to implement. The personalised products market is worth **billions per year**, yet eBay seems happy to ignore it entirely. So my questions to other sellers: * Do you think eBay is intentionally avoiding personalisation? * Is it a risk/dispute issue? * Is it about keeping listings interchangeable and price-comparable? * Or is eBay simply choosing not to modernise this part of commerce? I’m genuinely curious how others see this especially sellers who tried personalised products and gave up.",

    "text": "Topps Cosmic Chrome is my absolute favorite product in the Topps baseball line. (To each their own, I know). I bought three cases in 2022. Then in 2023 it jumped from $185 a box north of $275. I only got one case. Then last year it was $350 a box. I just bought two individual boxes. Fast forward to 2025 and we’re now at $549 a box. Up 295% from its release pricing just three years ago. For the first time, I won’t be buying any boxes at all. Michael Rubin and Fanatics are a cancer on this hobby. They’ve gone full heel turn and taken on the villain role; and he doesn’t even pretend to give a shit. He’s catering exclusively to breakers. He’s basically told me; and all the other average everyday buyers of wax, that we’re no longer needed. Please. I’m asking you. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. STOP BUYING INTO BREAKS. STOP PAYING THE INSANE PRICES THAT FANATICS IS SELLING FOR. If you all keep buying; they’ll keep raising prices higher and higher; with no end in sight. SAVE THE HOBBY. STOP BUYING TOPPS/FANATICS. And before all you “it’s free market economics blah blah” people chime in... no. It’s not. The Hobby has become a casino. It’s gone from an industry who sold to fathers and sons; to one that uses every trick in the book to make you believe you’re one pack away from life changing money. The lights. The noise. The breaker screaming at the top of their lungs. The bullshit “that spot is paid” (when it’s def not). It’s all a psy-op to get you more addicted to the point you can’t stop. The one and ONLY thing that will combat this; is to stop buying. Period.",

Hey everyone 👋 It’s been a while since I last updated about the [PokePulse.io](http://PokePulse.io) ALPHA and figured some of you may be interested in how its progressing! (with mod persmission of course) The main goal’s still the same: the best platform for UK collectors using UK-only sold data for raw, graded, and sealed products. Tracking over 200k+ products now! Stuff that’s been added since my last update: * **AI card scanning** (raw, PSA, and ACE slabs) for instant prices — I’ve been using this myself at card shows as a buyer/vendor and it’s been solid * **Deal calculators** for buy / sell / trade * **Multiple portfolios** so you can split your collection up properly and track all purchases/sales you make * **Market analytics** (compare and trend UK market prices, growth, gem rates, grade pops, potential profit, etc.) * **Custom price alerts** * **Imports from Collectr**, eBay purchases, and CSVs * **CardMarket data** from UK sellers for sealed + raw cards (per condition) * **Vendor inventory tools** — still early, but a few vendors are already running parts of their business on it It's getting closer to beta now, and finally starting to look like the UK-focused market platform I wanted to exist for my own collecting and investing! Still loads more to do, and a big thanks to everyone who already uses it and helps with data and feature feedback ❤️ Happy to answer questions and hear what people want to see next (use invite code ALPHATEST at [https://pokepulse.io](https://pokepulse.io) if you want to give it a whirl) 👍",

    "text": "Which Pokémon Cards Are Worth Grading? A Collector’s Mini-Guide # Which Pokémon Cards Are Worth Grading? A Collector’s Mini-Guide Grading your Pokémon cards can protect them, increase resale value, and make your collection more collectible. But not all cards are worth the effort. Here is a practical guide to help you decide. --- ## 1. Look at Rarity Focus on cards that are historically in demand: - First editions (Base Set, Jungle, Fossil) - Promo and holo cards - Modern chase cards (full art, shiny, or tournament exclusives) Even some newer cards can surprise you in value if graded highly. --- ## 2. Condition Matters Grading is all about the card’s physical state: - Corners and edges: sharp corners get higher grades - Surface: no scratches, scuffs, or dirt - Centering: cards should be well-aligned Use a free tool to check centering before submission: [Josh Beet CG Centering Tool](https://centering.joshbeetcg.com/) --- ## 3. Compare Grading Services - Beckett: beginner-friendly, fast turnaround, transparent pricing. [Start with Beckett](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-101610475-15435040) - PSA: widely recognized, strong resale impact for high-end cards. [Check PSA](https://www.psacard.com/) Pro tip: Beckett is great if you want quick processing and solid market value. PSA is ideal if you are aiming for top-tier auctions. --- ## 4. Check Market Value Before Grading You do not want to spend money grading a card that will not see a return: - [TCGPlayer Price Guide](https://www.tcgplayer.com/) – see current market trends - [Pokellector](https://www.pokellector.com/) – track your collection and rarity - Using eBay Sold listings is great to see current market prices. --- ## 5. Summary Grading can be a game-changer if you pick the right cards and use the right tools. Start with rare or valuable cards, check condition and centering, and pick a grading service that fits your goals. Using free tools and market research ensures you get the most out of your graded cards.",

    "text": "Current Vault Shipping Experience Recently got a high value card (~12k) graded and originally shipped it to vault to sell on EBay. It took a couple weeks for vault shipping to go through but then I experienced weeks of issues and 2 tickets with PSA where no matter how many times I tried to list on EBay, it would never work. After a month of dealing with that, I decided to ship back to me and I’ll sell myself. And the point of the post is this is the current timeframe you can expect shipping from the vault: 15 Nov: Paid to ship from vault, cost $13 total including under 90 day fee. Status changed to “shipped” but did not receive a tracking number. Nothing for almost a month... 12 Dec: I finally cracked and decided to make another ticket. As I was typing of the ticket I decided to check my email one last time and somehow got the shipping info at that exact moment. 16 Dec: card arrived, signature required. Just awareness for anyone waiting on vault shipping so that you don’t panic when weeks go by without hearing anything.",

    "text": "Don't use BGS Germany I've been grading cards since 2019 with BGS and have hit a 90%+ accuracy rate with my pre grades. Frankly, BGS Germany is like a brand new grading company and their standards do not match the ones set by the USA hub. I have sent twice and both times my cards have graded 1 to 1.5 less then my pre grades. To show their inconsistency I resent a vintage shadowless Pokemon Holo, (originally a PSA 9 new cert, which received a quad BGS 9 grade the first time I sent it in) which centering went from a 9 to a 10 (it was better than a 9, but still - how should the one objective subgrade change so much?). Another example is the pristine shining mew that was a PSA 9 new cert. How did it get a BGS 8.5 (8 surface is crazy, it was flawless)? The card is clearly also OC and I had sent it in assuming it would get a 9 centering grade - but it got a 9.5 which it shouldn't have. The shadowless 9++ Raichu is one of the cleanest Shadowless holos I've owned (I've graded 4 shadowless 9.5 holos, Blastoise and 3 raichus) and frankly deserves the bump. BGS EU didn't think so and was returned to me. I refuse to send more cards to BGS EU until I can see their grading is more aligned with BGS USA as it's just a waste of money at this point and 3 months waiting. All of these OP cards deserved higher graded imo. That being said, I see a lot of opportunity buying BGS 9.5s that were graded in the EU hub and cracking, sending to PSA or resubbed to BGS.",

    "text": "Warning when using Courtyard.io Serious Concerns About Courtyard.io – “Vaulted” Card Could Not Be Produced I’m posting this as a warning to other collectors. I redeemed a high-end card from Courtyard.io that was explicitly represented as being held in their vault. After the redemption was processed, I was informed the card could not be located. The only resolution offered was wallet credit based on their internal valuation, and covered shipping costs. This wasn’t just any card: • Jamaal Charles auto/patch 08/15, Low population and the only graded copy in existence, let alone a PSA 10 • It was effectively a 1/1 • Purchased as a long-term investment • My first redeemed card on the platform When a platform built on “secure vaulting” cannot produce a low population PSA 10, that’s not a minor operational issue — it’s a fundamental breakdown of trust and inventory integrity. At this point, it’s difficult to believe this card was ever actually in the vault or accurately represented at the time of sale. If a vaulted asset doesn’t exist when redeemed, then buyers are taking on risks they were never clearly informed about. I’m sharing this because this experience has ended my use of the platform, and I suspect it will for others once they understand what “vaulted” can really mean in practice. Do your own due diligence. Ask hard questions. Don’t assume safeguards exist just because they’re advertised.",

    "text": "From Ecuador, trying to build tools for collectors — not just another grading label. I’m a long-time collector from Ecuador who somehow ended up running a small grading project. Instead of doing a pure “look at my company” post, I wanted to share what we’re trying to build and ask if this actually makes sense from a collector’s point of view. Context: collecting from Latin America If you live in the US, you send your cards to PSA/BGS/CGC and that’s it. If you live in most of Latin America, it’s a mess: you ship through intermediaries you pay crazy shipping and customs you wait months and you still don’t have any real digital way to manage your collection I’m trying to solve that problem first, and grading is just the entry point. The project is called OGS (Opulence Grading System), based in Ecuador, but the idea is bigger than just slabbing cards. --- The idea: a “collector tools” platform, not a marketplace clone What we’re building inside the user account is basically: 1. Ownership transfer between users If two collectors trade/sell peer-to-peer, they can move the card from one account to another inside the system. No marketplace, no listing fees – just a record of who currently owns it. 2. Ability to “release” a card If you sell a card outside the platform (show, Instagram, eBay, whatever), you can release it so the next owner can claim it. That way there aren’t 5 people saying “that card is mine” years later. 3. A real collection manager Front/back images, serial, grade details, ownership status – all in one place. Nothing fancy visually yet, but functional. 4. Things we want to add if the base works direct send-to-auction for some houses AI-assisted pre-grading digital vaulting population reports an optional “trust”/reputation layer for peer-to-peer deals optional public profiles for people who actually want visibility This is not meant to replace eBay or MySlabs or anything like that. The goal is simply to give people in this region tools we never had.",

    "text": "When I saw Ricks Sheriff Hat was offered on Heritage Auctions in October of 2025, I was interested to bid on it but somethings made me feel skeptical about it. For example, in the Heritage Auctions listing for the sheriff's hat with the badge, the badge looks way too big for the hat. Also, the auction hat badge was extremely glossy, with little to no wear. If you look at pictures of Rick Grimes wearing the sheriff's hat with a badge, you will notice that the badge is smaller in size and protrudes forward on the hat (see attached picture). The badge at Heritage Auctions was completely flat and very large. I was also able to see this hat with the badge in person when Heritage Auctions was in their New York office, and I asked the expert there about the size of the badge. He agreed with me that the badge looked different from the one pictured right next to the hat when it was displayed. He told me that when he was with AMC sourcing all the props for the auction, he worked closely with AMC and checked every box to ensure authenticity. He also noted that this hat and badge were in a museum for a couple of years before this auction, but I did not catch the location he mentioned. But when I got home that day, I rewatched every episode in which Rick Grimes wore this hat and badge, and I could not find the enlarged/flat shiny badge on the hat for the Heritage Auction. Furthermore, I also noticed that the badge on Rick's Sheriff Hat that was offered appears to have been changed/removed for Heritage Auctions' \"Auction Preview\" in Chicago in July. When you look at the badge on Rick's Sheriff Hat for that preview, you can clearly see that the enlarged/flat shiny badge appears to have been removed and replaced with a much smaller-looking badge (see attached picture). In addition, if you look at a promotional picture that Heritage Auctions posted about Rick's Sheriff Hat and uniform, you can clearly see that the badge on that hat is the correct size and shape (see attached picture",

    "text": "How I ship a sports card valued over $20 or any graded card. Whenever someone asks, “How do you ship a sports card valued over $20?” If it’s a card valued over $19.99 or in a slab (or even 1-3 cards in this range), this is how I ship them for maximum protection: 1. Put the card and a Dad Man's Dugout sticker in a team bag. 2. Secure the card between 2 pieces of cardboard for extra stability. 3. Wrap it all with a rubber band to hold everything in place. 4. Include my handwritten thank-you note: I thank the customer for their purchase, ask them to follow my eBay store, Whatnot account, and social media. I also provide 1 or 2 fun facts about the player and ask for their feedback. 5. Place it in a bubble mailer, then nest that inside another bubble mailer for double protection. 6. Add a \"Fragile: Handle with Care\" sticker on the outside. For cards valued under $20, I keep it simpler with a team bag, folded paper case, and painter's tape inside a thank-you card (check my other video for details!). I'll upload more videos soon!

    "text": "End of 2025 \"Where to find cards\" Buying Guide **TLDR:** There are no easy ways to get Pokemon cards without spending a lot per pack, sorry. But since a lot of people keep posting and asking, this'll break down what else you can try. **Why cant I find cards:** \\-2025 Popularity Surge and Price Bubble - Starting late 2024 Pokemon card popularity began to once again surge, with the surge came scarcity as product was unable to be fulfilled to meet demand. This unprecedented demand was met with surging prices as well beginning a ridiculous value increase spiral that has caught the eyes of not just the general public but also big money investors. The more money that gets focused into the hobby, the more people start to hear about it, and unfortunately the more people try finding opportunity to make money from others in the hobby. \\-Scalpers - These are the people who follow around card vendors, buy everything they can so that others cant get it, then flip it for 2x or 3x price. If you are dedicated and thorough you can make some serious money doing this BUT IT IS HIGHLY RISKY. One bad buy could tie up thousands and waste your time trying to sell. \\-Cardshops - In response to the popularity and scalpers, many shops have taken to raising prices themselves to take in as much profit while the market is hot. Some may be scalpers themselves hitting up stores to stock their own store, or they can be in cahoots with scalpers buying at just under market price to resell above market price since its still tough to find cards. Its a two way street that never benefits the general buyer. \\-Grading - You pay a company (hopefully reputable) to assess the condition of your card. This is usually done for 2 of the many reasons, protection or resale. Since factories are pumping cards out in a mad rush, quality control is terrible. If a card is assessed at Gem Mint condition (usually listed as a 10) then it is likely in the top percentage of condition for that card, this gives it a massive p",

    "text": "Shipper being billed the recipients import duties/taxes/fees 2 months after delivery is completed? I sell on eBay and I've been shipping internationally with Fedex for years and I've never had this happen before. Before anyone asks I'm not based in the US so unfortunately can't use eBays GSP for international orders, I would if I could. A Fedex shipment to the UK was delivered 3 months ago. I always monitor my international shipments and along the shipping journey it showed the normal International shipment release - Import, which has always previously meant the recipient has paid any duties/taxes/fees which were due, the shipment was then delivered and that was the end of that. I paid the invoice for the shipping when Fedex invoiced me a short while after that. Now 3 months later I received a $110 invoice for the duties/taxes/fees that were due for the shipment. I queried the invoice and the billing department says payment for the duties/taxes/fees was not received within 90 days from the recipient so the shipper is now liable for the charges. But if that was the case how was the shipment even released for import, I have had shipments previously where the recipient has initially refused to pay the duties/taxes/fees and the shipment does not move until they are settled. In those cases I at least have some leverage at that point because my shipments are from eBay sales, if the recipient fails to pay the duties/taxes/fees they forfeit the entire order with no refund and the goods are returned to sender. Once that realisation hits home the recipients have always paid the duties/taxes/fees owing and the shipment is then delivered. But in this case with the item having already been delivered and it now being 3 months down the line I'm right up sht creek with no paddle in that regard. Does anyone have any idea what has transpired here? EDIT : The actually delivery date was over 3 months ago, I was going off of the invoice date which was issued at a later date. I have upda",

    "text": "How I ship a trading card valued $20 or under When someone asks, \"How do you ship a sports card valued under $20?\"If it's just 1-3 cards valued under $20, this is how I ship them: 1. Put the card and a Dad Man's Dugout sticker in a team bag. 2. Take a half sheet of paper and fold it to create a protective case around the team bag. 3. Tape the card inside a thank-you card using painter's tape. 4. In the thank-you card, thank the customer for their purchase, ask them to follow my eBay store, Whatnot account, and social media. I also provide 1 or 2 fun facts about the player and ask for their feedback. If it's a card valued over $19.99 or in a slab, I send it a little differently—I use cardboard for extra protection extremely secure. I’ll upload more videos soon!

He wrote back and said he bought it from an eBay seller a few weeks prior and sent a picture of the listing which has a heritage reference number and says it is 39mm. This watch made it through the “Authentication” process and was delivered. There is no way they looked at this watch because at the very least the reference number in the listing was not 79000.

Now these are quadruple the price. All I want are my pretty, hand-made cards! Where are you getting yours? EDIT: Thanks, everyone, for the links to the Hallmark cards. I really appreciate it.

    "text": "I got lucky, but be careful. This is a full on degen casino at your fingertips! I'm going to tell my story with Power Packs and how it could have gone very, very wrong for me. It first started when I got the email from GameStop promoting beta access to their Power Pack site. I started on the small packs, but got nothing too great. Then I got my first chase from the $100 pack, the Surging Sparks Pikachu (at the time worth $900-$1000). [First Chase Hit](https://preview.redd.it/dwbqjafj5x4g1.png?width=1863&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcb1b3f908306e7d54a1af3127c4094b9e774b85) It all spiraled down from there. Kept on spending, selling pack, and \"pulling\" the lever so to speak. I cashed out when I \"won\", but had a tendency to push my luck. And as a result, I kept losing to the house which is the Power Pack casino. Thousands and thousands of dollars down the drain within less than a month. All spent on credit cards. As I pulled more and more, I got a few hits, but a LOT of misses. Then the Lunar Packs got announced and I rolled twice. First time, I broke \"even\" with a PSA 9 #4 Charizard (worth $1.8k to $3.3k) [First Lunar Pack](https://preview.redd.it/lntkmjzk5x4g1.png?width=1849&format=png&auto=webp&s=78a565342d8c13d6ad9579cdafec809d68df2815) Then my second Lunar Pack, I got the #17 Umbreon Gold Star (worth $11,750) and instantly sold it. I later checked the sale history for this card and I was SO FUCKING LUCKY that the last one sold for $11k on eBay for GameStop to even offer that big of a buyback. [Second Lunar Pack](https://preview.redd.it/1o41gecw5x4g1.png?width=1897&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e94c958e275766ead4ee9169bb5263371f71e20) [Not Taking Any Chances](https://preview.redd.it/eerz8edo5x4g1.png?width=1773&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b44caeff830c11f904247f4dcd223cca0dc6ceb) If there was any notion of a sign to get the fuck out, this was it.

    "text": "Grading opinion for a noob card owner Hi gang, looking for some advice on whether to get these cards graded. I inherited them from my dad and I did as much research as I could on 130point, PSA, and eBay but the comps range wildly. Basically looking for whether it’s worth it to get all, some, or none of these cards graded. I am a huge noob so please bear with me, notes listed below: - the Tony Gonzalez Topps Chrome card has an orange border, does that make it more valuable? - the Joe Namath card is in pretty awful condition. Is it even worth selling raw? - I think the Frank Thomas card and 5 other cards from the 1989 NFL Topps set are worth grading since they’re in pretty great condition - same logic as above for Kevin McHale and Julius Erving, they’re in pretty good condition - the remaining 6 basketball cards on the bottom row are pretty beat up. Prob can’t be graded but are they even worth selling raw? Thank you",

    "text": "eBay refunds on card purchases... I’m selling cards on eBay and in the last few weeks I’ve had to refund card buyers their money because they claim they did not receive the card. Whether or not they actually did receive it, I do not know because USPS isn’t consistent on scanning and updating the tracking if shipped via eBay envelope (value under $20). In these instances is there any way to not be forced by eBay to refund the purchaser since I did ship it based on eBay’s tracking? Moving forward do I just need to increase my shipping costs so there is a USPS tracking label on every purchase no matter the cost for the card itself? Meaning the shipping would then be about $6.",

    "text": "I’m sure this is a question as old as time, but forgive my ignorance. As a collector who has been in the hobby for a year, I have learned quite a bit, but I still have much more learning to do. I’m sure the question above will help others like me who are slowly getting into the hobby. I have a local card shop in my area that has very reasonable prices for the sports that I collect, which is football (soccer), European basketball, and baseball. They do an amazing job of getting any hobby box that I request if they are able. This year I have been able to pick up topps finest, multiple topps chrome products, and really any baseball product I would like. I typically prefer to buy hobby boxes over blasters/retail and I am slowly getting into buying singles on EBay and at local card shows. I really enjoy being a wax ripping degenerate and I even protect a lot of my base cards even though I know boxes are -EV long term. There is one thing I have noticed, sometimes my LCS prices hobby boxes higher than what I can find online from retailers like Dave and Adam’s and Blowout Cards. For example, I want a box of 2024-25 Topps Chrome UEFA Club Competitions Soccer Hobby Box. My LCS is selling it for $225. Wax Stat has the average box price $239.95, and then there is another site that I saw a box for $200. Let me say this, I know that shops are really able to price their products however the hell they want and they probably get products at MSRP. My LCS is not budging on his price with me and I fear his 15 boxes will sit on the shelf for a long time. As a consumer, I’m a little bit of a penny pincher and I want to make sure I’m not overpaying for the same product. Is there any tips that long term collector can give me that will save me money long term? Side note, one thing that I have an issue with is breakers buying vast amounts of product which then inadvertently drives the price up. I have been able to get a box of Topps premier league for around $150 and snag two boxes, that pro",

The only issue is that I move back to the Netherlands on January 23rd. The time listed on the website for regular and express is both 10 work days, but it also mentions a month long backlog. In other words, the timing will be very tight. Realistically, what are my chances for getting my graded card in time? Does anybody have experience with PSA Japan? On the other hand, if it doesn’t work out, I am planning on having it shipped to the Netherlands instead (which I believe is possible). The issue I am now facing is whether or not I would have to pay 21% VAT over the speculative value of the card, even though I am not buying it for that price but rather having my own card shipped to me. That would be a very heavy hit in combination with the PSA grading price itself. Ps: I have added some ugly photos of the card in case anyone would like to see it.

This also lets me re-evaluate updated hobby &amp; jumbo pricing and compare how they stack up against retail.

For total production and print-run data, please refer back to my original breakdown [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/baseballcards/comments/1nzvw3y/202526_topps_basketball_breakdown_and_deep_dive/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button). **Hit Frequencies:** Most formats remain unchanged from the original post, but here are the two formats with newly confirmed info: Costco Super Box • 1 auto per 6.48 boxes • 15.14 parallels/box • 12.02 inserts/box • 1 # card per 1.42 boxes • 3.45 boxes per relic Black Friday Target Value Box • 1 auto per 19.44 boxes • 9.27 parallels/box • 10.26 inserts/box • 1 # card per 1.72 boxes • 1 relic per 8.07 boxes **Value Landscape:** Assumes current Blowout prices of $225/hobby, $440/jumbo, and MSRP on all retail SKUs. Black Friday Value Boxes are now confirmed at $35, and Costco Super Boxes at $45 online (some buyers have shown pricing of $40 in their local store, but my calculations will assume the $45 MSRP). **Best $ per card** 1) Fat pack — 19 cents 2) Costco Super Box — 21 cents 3) Hanger boxes &amp; Mega boxes — 22 cents **Worst $ per card** 10) Jumbo- $1.04 9) Hobby- 85 cents 8) Value Box- 30 cents **Best $ per parallel** 1) Fanatics Value Box — $2.47 2) Costco Super Box — $2.97 3) Value Box — $5.83 4) Black Friday Target Value Box — $5.93 **Worst $ per parallel** 10) Hobby — $37.27 9) Jumbo — $27.59 8) Fat Pack — $13.21 **Best $ per auto** 1) Costco Super Box — $291.60 2) Hobby — $394.23 3) Jumbo — $419.19 (This is one of the rare times ho",

    "text": "Mailman accidently marked 30 packages as delivered when doing a pickup. 10 INR cases opened. USPS denied insurance, eBay won't cover me because no proof of delivery. I had a package pickup of 30 packages at my house. My mailman accidently marked them all as delivered instead of picked up. She said it was an accident as she was delivering a package in a rush and didn't change the screen. Almost immediately I had 30 messages from buyers accusing me of cheating them. Even after explaining to the buyers that everything was ok they would still get the package and it was just a mistake 10 people immediately opened up INR cases. I do have a pretty large account, but i'm still worried about what 10 INR cases in 1 day will do to my metrics. The tracking says delivered to my house and while the items still got delivered to the buyers there were no updates on the public website after the mistaken delivery scan. USPS told me that is by design to not update after delivery, but their internal system shows all updates. I got the internal tracking report printed out from my post office for all 10 INR cases from USPS that shows delivery to the buyers and eBay denied it saying they only accept online tracking from the carriers website. USPS denied the insurance claim because the internal tracking shows delivered. Of the 10 cases open, 3 were closed by the buyers when they got the item but the other 7 cases are still open and the buyers are not responding to any of my messages. They were pretty instant to complain and open a case, but now that it's delivered they are nowhere to be found. No one has escalated the case yet but I will instantly lose the money and get defects if they do. Has this happened to anyone before or any other advice? I have called eBay many times about it and they say the tracking is not valid and my report is not valid. They said I could maybe appeal once eBay refunds the buyer but that is my only option and there is no guarantee.",

My feedback is great as a buyer but basically non-existent as a seller. The buyer is on the other side of the country so I can't deliver in person. The card is graded and slabbed, but won't go through the eBay authentication process. My thoughts-- please tell me if I should do anything different: 1) Accept the offer 2) Video of myself packing the card at Fedex, every step of the way -- including the tracking number-- and never having focus off the card. 3) Sending it for the full insured amount -- overnight (overkill?) with signature required. Is there anything else I'm not considering? I'm worried about all sorts of things. The buyer has feedback over 60 and 100% and has been an eBay member for almost 20 years.",

    "text": "PSA Grading in Canada or US? Hey everybody! I just dropped off my cards in-person at the PSA Canada location in Mississauga yesterday for the first time. First off I thought it would be some hugeee space with a fancy reception area and a PSA grading sweatshop in the back. It was not. Instead it was just 2 really cool guys chilling that helped me out. Felt like I just entered a LCS. The space was small I mean real small like the size of a standard public washroom. From what I have seen online the grading process does NOT take place in Canada instead PSA Canada still operates as a middle man and sends it off to the US. I could not find some definitive information on this they imply it but don’t openly say “hey guys the grading process still takes place in the US.” Honestly huge bummer because the middle men I was using before was A. Cheaper ($32 per card with them) and ($40 per card with PSA) B. The other guys I was using didn’t even charge me for shipping to begin with. And C. If PSA grades in the USA the turnaround time should be about the same. (It took 73 days with the other guys... PSA tbd) Ultimately my question is this. Does anyone know if I’m wrong and the grading process does indeed take place in Canada? Thanks!!",

    "text": "It’s clear that Riftbound has reached an audience that includes a huge amount of people that have never played TCGs and know nothing about the financial aspect of the hobby. I love TCGs and the League universe so Riftbound being successful is great news to me. But a lot of people need their expectations set or reset as to how this all works. **1. TCGs are, by and large, an expensive, time-consuming, luxury hobby if you take them seriously.** Absent current market dynamics (which I’ll touch on later), acquiring meta cards for a set will never be “cheap” (depending on your current financials). If a card is in demand, its price will go up. This is basic economics. Pokémon is considered one of the cheapest card games and decks still cost ~$60 to ~$150, and that obviously scales as you buy and experiment with more archetypes. For Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Flesh & Blood, One Piece, etc. it’s not uncommon for a top archetype to run you $300-$500+ for a deck. That’s just the way it is and there’s no reason to expect Riftbound to be any different. In addition, if you truly want to take the game seriously, you’ll likely need to travel nationally (and even internationally) to events which demands airfare and lodging costs at minimum, in addition to a large amount of vacation days or a job that allows you to pick your hours. This is another layer of expense that isn’t considered but is even more meaningful than the price of the cards and will easily run you in the thousands per year, if not more. All that is to say that, if you’re looking for a cheap hobby where you can compete at the highest level with a low buy-in, search elsewhere. It is largely a rich man’s game. That’s the pattern, not necessarily a rule, but you should level your expectations. **2. Proxies will never be allowed in any official event ever, point blank, period.** This should be obvious but I have seen several posts on here discussing the legality or morality of using proxies at events. DO NOT USE PROXIES AT AN OFFI",

I can't tell you how many times its happened. I find a listing I'm interested in, go to the description, and its just \"This item is a quintessential addition to your collection. With a plastic construction and durable metal details, its sure to last. It is manufactured by this company, a well-known brand in this hobby. If features a green color and is suitable for ages 14 and up. This ready-to-play item is 1:45 scale and sure to capture your imagination in miniature form.\" I mean, honestly, can't people see how awful and fake that sounds? The description is there to tell buyers more about the item and help them see if its a good idea to buy it. What I don't want from an eBay description is useless gushing. Added to that, I doubt its even an AI powering it. Most likely, its just a template that fills in the information you give it. Because it all sounds the same. Like, *exactly* the same. I've sold quite a few things on eBay and I've written detailed descriptions for each and every item. Its not that difficult. And you're more likely to make the sale if you put in that effort. I tried the AI description once and I'm glad I read it before listing the item because it told the buyer nothing more than they could clearly see from the title and pictures. Am I the only one who views it this way? So many sellers use it now and its so dumb.",

Context: -2 most recent sales ~770 -Traditionally a 650-800 card -4 consecutive sales between 11/16-11/20 around 500 I’ve had plenty of cards where this scenario is flipped; I go to accept the offer on my Vaulted card, and it’s expired.

    "text": "I’ve been in the hobby for a while and mostly buy singles, but I wanted to try Fanatics Collect’s Instant Rip just to see how everything works. Dropped $250 on a basketball pack just out of curiosity. I actually pulled a legit grail: a 2014 LeBron James patch card. Their system immediately showed a “value” around $1,400, which made no sense at all. Realistic value is maybe $500 to $600. So I skipped their whole end-of-process valuation and took the $1,200 instant credit. That part was easy. Everything after that... not great. The user interface feels like it was designed by someone who doesn’t collect. It’s clunky, the layout is strange, and finding basic info takes more taps than it should. Their weekly auction structure also feels odd. Maybe there’s a reason for it, but from the outside it just seems limiting. Their Card Ladder pricing is rough. They’re pulling comps from 2022, so you basically have to bounce between eBay and their app to figure out real values. It slows everything down and makes it hard to trust what you’re looking at. I used my $1,200 credit toward an overpriced 1980 Topps Bird–Magic–Dr. J rookie PSA 7 listed at $1,600. I paid the extra $400 cash to cover the difference and added it to my collection. Cool. Then I tried to withdraw it. They hit me with a $75 fee. $48 to “withdraw” the card, with no explanation or breakdown. $25 shipping. Plus tax. Paying $75 just to get a card in hand is wild. It makes the whole thing feel like a cash grab built on keeping you inside their ecosystem and charging you every time you try to leave it. At this point I’m deleting the app and won’t be using it again. That’s just my experience, but it was enough for me.",

So I play on Xbox, and normally when I am done, I just dashboard out, that way when I jump back in, I just quick start to where I was, without having to wait for the game to load. Well I competed my daily vault card missions on Thursday, and yesterday when I quick started back in, I was still showing the completed missions from the day before. I didn't think much of it, as I just assumed they hadn't reloaded yet, and I didn't end up getting to play for that long anyways. However, when I jumped back on today, they were still the same completed missions. That's when I realized I probably had to quit out to the main menu, and low and behold, the fresh missions updated. So to anyone else that just dashboards out, make sure you quit to the main menu, so you can get your updated daily Vault card missions.",

    "text": "PSA wait times are unacceptable and deceptive EDIT: 7hrs after posting theyve announced they're changing exactly what I had issues with here! fair play to PSA, I know 95 days sounds like a lot but the increased clarity now is amazing. [Link to PSA post](https://www.psacard.com/articles/articleview/15625/updates-to-estimated-turnaround-times?j=694785&sfmc_sub=63982559&l=347_HTML&u=11607988&mid=534005128&jb=11&utm_source=sfmc&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=PSA_20251120_PSA-M_PSATATUpdate&utm_term=Learn%20More&utm_id=694785&sfmc_id=63982559&%24web_only=true) I understand the high demand, but they need to be transparent about wait times as the current system is unacceptable and extremely deceptive. Value Bulk had a 60 business day wait time, which has been updated to 65. I sent in a submission expecting it to take 12 weeks, or \\~3 months to return and boy was I wrong. I sent in 26 cards the day before I left for college, Sep 2nd. Package arrived on the 5th, and PSA marked it as arrived Sep 9th. I expected these to be complete \\~ Early December. They then did not open my box until October 12th. My package had sat there for 5 weeks, and the 12-week countdown had not even begun. My submission has still not passed grading, and arrived at psa 79 days ago. It is expected to be completed on January 14th, but as we've seen PSA is quite often late and will not hit this deadline. A PSA submission, best-case scenario, will take longer than the entire semester of school. I understand high demand right now, and high wait times. However, claiming 65 business days while the actual expected date is 134 days away, and will likely be missed, is absurd and deceptive. I don't see how they continue to take express submissions for hundreds in grading fees, yet provide no clarity at all on the return speeds of normal submissions.",

As the title says, I’m scared to send my babies in the mail for grading due to the small chance they could be damaged, lost or stolen on the way to PSA or on the way back to me. All cards are my original pulls from 99 through 2001. Highest value for sure is shadowless charizard that imo is 9 (or even 10...) worthy and selling on eBay for $9k+. Others are in great condition as well, just not shadowless charizard level value. Never subbed before. Live in CA which is far from Florida (I understand that’s where PSA is, but not sure if they have other locations closer to me). Very nervous to put my cards in the mail. I have at least 80 that I’d like to send eventually but due to the risk of losing them all and cost for higher priced cards would not send all of them at once.",

    "text": "PSA offering to buy my cards after revealing my grade. When did this become normal? I have a submission processing right now and I noticed something different when I got my grades revealed to me. After my grade reveal was done, PSA offered to buy my cards off me and gave me a 24 hour countdown to sell to them. Before this submission, my last order cleared in August and I got no such offer in the app or anywhere else. I can’t help but think that PSA, the company that grades cards, is intentionally downgrading certain cards with the hope that I’d sell to them, and they’d just regrade for a 10. I’m not a scrub. I did my due diligence of checking all cards and gently cleaning them before sending them out for grading. Boy was I surprised that only 8 out of 39 came back as 10’s. I can’t shake this feeling that there is an obvious incentive for PSA to screw me out of quality cards so they can auction it themselves in eBay. I dunno, maybe I’m overreacting. Am I crazy in thinking this?",

Last night I saw a breaker on fanatics live pull 2 logoman cards from the same box. Then I found another youtube video of a different fanatics live breaker doing the same thing. Shohei auto logoman? Fanatics Live. Of the dozens of cases I watched get ripped on whatnot, I maybe saw 2 logomen total. I watched 2 diamond studs get pulled on fanatics, none on whatnot. In one case on whatnot, there was a box with a factory error. Where there should have been an autograph card, there was instead a piece of white paper with the ID number of a card hand written on it, that looked like it was ripped by hand from a larger sheet of paper. No redemption code or info.",

So my younger brother (21) tried that Courtyard thing where you mail them your actual card and they give you a “digital token” or whatever. Thought it was cool and futuristic. He sends them his PSA 10 Charizard and bro instantly regrets it because he realizes he basically gave the card away. He can’t see it, can’t touch it, just gets a tiny spinning picture like “trust me bro, it’s safe.” He tried requesting it back and the process is insane. There’s extra fees, and weird steps. It legit feels like the card is trapped in some digital jail. He’s panicking like: “Did I just PAY someone to lock up my own stuff??” And honestly the more he shows me, the more it looks like NFT era nonsense but with real objects this time. Anyway he’s still trying to get the card returned. At this point I’m just hoping it actually exists and some warehouse dude hasn’t started wearing it as jewelry.",

Cool move, right? But here’s the kicker: GameStop’s been quietly building its own Power Packs + NFT marketplace, already minting authenticated, serialized digital collectibles with on-chain provenance. eBay’s handing PSA their crown jewels... while GameStop’s setting up the damn vault and the metaverse that displays it. One’s playing 2015 FinTech catch-up. The other’s quietly engineering 2030 digital ownership. They can lock their cards in PSA vaults all they want — but the real vault is the balance sheet: 💰 $9.6B in cash + BTC 💎 A DRS army 🦍 A marketplace ready to tokenize everything This isn’t a collectible bubble — it’s the tokenization of tangible nostalgia.

Now, i’m looking for an Ohtani Auto but they are all over $2500 and no one is willing to sell outside the US. I’ve messaged many sellers without success. I understand the potential problems for the sellers in this case. My preffered shipping method would be DHL insured for full value as i don’t want to skip customs in, i just want the card to arrive safely. :) Card shows are not an option as they are very scarce in the EU and sportscards for US sports are even harder to get (mostly Pokemon and other gaming cards). And other auction sites like Goldin or Heritage just don’t offer a variety of cards like eBay and tend to only offer even more expensive cards. Does anybody have suggestion how to work the problem or how to communicate with a seller to make an exception? I also would like to add that i still would like to use eBay just for safety reasons. Thanks!",

That felt like the beginning of a new partnership. Think about it, other than GameStop, where else would you go to buy used video games? EBay.

Not Fanatics. GameStop. You know, the “brick-and-mortar dinosaur” hedge funds swear is supposed to be bankrupt by now. Meanwhile GME is over here building: • a marketplace • a grading pipeline • a distribution loop • and now a multi-sport collectibles ecosystem ...all with PSA smiling and delivering product straight into it like a UPS driver in heat. But yeah, tell me again how “fundamentals don’t support it.” Because the only fundamentals I see are: 💎 PSA partnering deeper 💎 more IP 💎 more categories 💎 more revenue streams 💎 and a collectibles market bigger than some entire sectors of the S&P. We went from “they sell used games” to “they just hijacked the future of graded collectibles.” And the media still hasn’t noticed. Good. Let them sleep. We’ll wake them up later. 🚀🟣",

    "text": "GameStop is stronger than ever, GME is a safe bet I bought my first GME in 2021 during the huge run up and have watched every second of GameStop's turnaround. The stock has gone up and down and is currently at a relative low point. I just want to make some bullet points on why I am bullish as ever, hold more shares than I ever have, and why I'm completely comfortable buying and holding into 2026: - Ryan Cohen and the board have continually bought and held shares. We added a new board member from PSA Nat Turner and hopefully we see his buy soon, he can get in at a nice low price currently - In 2021 GME hit $120 (or more depending on broker) before brokers turned off the buy button. Since then GameStop has went from losing money to making money and having $9 billion in assets. I expect to break that price point - Last earnings shareholders were given a warrant dividend on their shares, strike price of $32. It educated us on derivatives, will make GameStop some more cash as long as GME exceeds $32 by next Halloween, and makes shareholders money if they choose to sell or execute. I would guess that next earnings we could receive another - GameStop moves quietly, they just released a physical videogame for GameBoy and Retromod called Buck and the Cursed Cartridge, game looks fun and inventive. Ryan Cohen is cooking behind the scenes and told us to judge him by his actions not his words. GameStop will post even better earnings this quarter from PowerPacks revenue, PSA grading, and collectibles - Roaring Kitty used to stream talking about console cycles, Nintendo Switch 2 just released and will make GameStop some nice profits from those sales. We have seen the lines outside stores, GameStop is still a hub for gamers - DFV could still update us on a YOLO post since we saw he had 9,001,000 shares last post, but it would be interesting to see his share count including warrants or maybe new calls bought. There is no reason to believe he is not still holding, he tweeted all las",

I am not too familiar with the value of the cards, and I am not familiar with most of the players. I recently found out about PSA Vault, but am still confused on my next steps. I am trying to save time. Should I send the whole collection to PSA Vault and have them take care of everything?

I just want to make sure I am getting the most amount of money from this collection. I looked through the PSA Vault eBay store, and I see that there are some cards of not-so-famous players selling for a $20+ per card. Please go easy on this ignorant fella, just trying to get rid of old items, thank you LOL. Edit: This collection is from 20+ years ago. All raw cards, no graded. Cards from 80s, 90s, and early 2000s.

    "text": "☕ 59 Coffee Break Detective Pikachu Promos - My First Time Grading! Need PSA/Card Grading Tips! 🕵️♂️ I was incredibly lucky and managed to acquire 59 copies of the Coffee Break Detective Pikachu promo card. They are all in pristine condition—they've only been handled twice: once to open and once to immediately put them into storage. I've done some research and see a PSA 10 copy can sell for around the $400 range, which has me excited! I believe a large majority of my copies would grade highly, but I'm completely new to the process and need some guidance before I send them in. ❓ My Grading and Shipping Questions PSA Service Levels: I looked at the PSA website and saw different prices for submission. What is the actual difference in service for a higher price? Is it just the turnaround time (how fast they grade them) and the Max Declared Value for insurance/upcharge purposes? I'm only looking to get the cards graded, so I'm not sure which price tier to choose. Trial Submission: I'm planning on submitting a small batch (2 or 3 cards) first to get a feel for the process and see what grades I get back before sending in the rest. Does this sound like a good strategy? Grading Company (PSA vs. Others): Is PSA still the undisputed \"go-to\" and best value-maximizer for modern Pokémon cards? Are there other companies like CGC or BGS that the community prefers, and why? Shipping/Protection (Immediate Concern): This is my most urgent question! I currently do not have penny sleeves or card savers/toploaders. For a temporary solution until I can buy proper supplies, I'm currently using a makeshift method: Placing each card inside the smallest sandwich bag I have. Sandwiching the bagged card between two 5x5-inch pieces of cut-out cardboard. Securing the cardboard with rubber bands in a cross-pattern. Is this an acceptable temporary storage/shipping method to prevent damage while I wait for proper supplies to arrive? I'm worried the rubber bands might be too tight. 💰 Post-Grading: Wh",

    "text": "I do not understand the pricing of this card The 2009 Charizard Cracked Ice holo from the Platinum Arceus set has interesting pricing. From what I understand, the price is so low because it was offered as a promo card in a tin. However, even though it was a card you could simply purchase in a tin, after 16 years, it still only has a PSA 9 population of 229 and a PSA 10 population of 26. On top of that, up until 3 weeks ago, the price of a PSA 10 was only about $1200, until 2 weeks ago when one was suddenly sold in an Ebay auction for $9300. PSA 9 is still going for around the $200 mark. It's obvious that this card is highly illiquid and not very sought after, but I'm just wondering why that is, and if someone can explain to me why it's so cheap in a PSA 9, and why the population is so low even though the card was readily available for purchase in a tin?",

    "text": "Can I escalate to the Financial Ombudsman if eBay refund buyers using my pending funds without responding to my complaint? Hi, I’m from England and I’m seeking legal advice on this situation. I sold three orders totalling around £2,000 using eBay’s “Simple Delivery” service (which includes Royal Mail tracking and lost-parcel coverage). Two of the parcels haven’t moved since they were scanned into the Royal Mail system, so the buyers opened “item not received” cases. Shortly after, my account was suspended — I suspect because of those two lost parcels, though eBay haven’t confirmed. I was told my payments would be held for 190 days, which I was okay with. However, eBay refunded both buyers using my pending funds, leaving me around £1,500 out of pocket. On the case screen, it said I didn’t need to take any action, and since Simple Delivery is meant to include coverage for lost parcels, I assumed both sides would be protected. I’ve already sent a formal complaint to eBay’s complaints email (confirmed by a customer service agent), but I haven’t received a response yet. My legal question is: If eBay don’t respond to my complaint within 15 days, how do I get a final response letter so I can escalate the issue — and would that go to CEDR or the Financial Ombudsman Service, given that it involves withheld seller funds and refunds taken from my pending balance? Any legal guidance on how to proceed would be really appreciated.",

Over the past 3 months, we quietly launched a private beta with support for 8 games — including Riftbound — and today, we’d love to invite folks from this amazing new TCG community to try it out and tell us what’s missing. **What we've built for Riftbound:** * 🆓 A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch) * 💸 Real-time price syncing with Cardmarket & TCGPlayer * 📊 Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early * 🗂️ Custom trade lists, deck-building lists, or whatever you collect * 🌍 Multi-TCG support: MTG, Pokémon, Lorcana, Flesh and Blood, Sorcery, One Piece, Rise TCG and now Riftbound (more coming soon) **This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on user feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 3 months ago and have started sharing our tool with the smaller TCG communities, but we feel that the time has come to share it with the Riftbound community before the big launch. **👉** We’re opening 200 early-access invites to the Riftbound community here: [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=riftboundtcg](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=riftboundtcg) **We're giving away 1 Origins Booster Box to one of the first 200 player who:** 1. Joins via the invite link 2. Adds some cards to their collection 3. Creates a list (trade / wishlist / decklist — your choice!) Our marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker will stay free forever. We're in this for the long haul - building the tools we wish existed to easily build decks, trade cards, and understand where your portfolio stands. We're still in beta, and we're really looking for some feedback/ideas to improve it, especially from the early Riftbound community. What features would make this invaluable fo",

    "text": "PSA - Don’t shill bid I recently bid on an item after asking the seller a question. The seller answered my question and also said they were hoping for the auction to get bid up higher because they would only make a few dollars if it sold for the starting bid. I thought that was weird but didn’t think much about it again until a few hours before the auction ended, an account with 0 feedback started bidding on the item. I was immediately suspicious and stopped bidding. The account with 0 feedback won the auction. To no one’s surprise, the seller just relisted the same item a few days later with a higher starting bid. I can’t find a way to report them so I just blocked them and won’t buy from them, but PSA if you are a seller, shill bidding is FRAUD and it’s ILLEGAL.",

It solves the pain of tracking card values, organizing collections, and staying on top of market trends. **Key Features:** - AI scanning with 95%+ accuracy (snap a photo, instant identification) - Real-time eBay pricing integration - Batch scanning (upload 50+ cards at once) - Price alerts when cards spike - Reddit buzz tracking - Works with all sports + Pokemon TCG **The Journey:** Started knowing zero about coding. Went through multiple pivots (trading platform → platform generator → fantasy sports → back to cards). Every step taught me something I needed for the next. Built the entire stack myself: React frontend, Node backend, Claude AI integration, Stripe payments, all of it. **Tech Stack:** - Frontend: React, Tailwind - Backend: Node.js, Express - Database: PostgreSQL - AI: Claude Vision API - Hosting: Railway + Vercel Would love your feedback! We're live on Product Hunt today: https://www.producthunt.com/products/slabtrack?utm_source=other&utm_medium=social Happy to answer any questions about the journey or the tech! 🚀",

    "text": "Determining Signature Card Values Obviously price is what the market dictates, but seeing how this question is asked a hundred times as the cards get opened, thought id share my thoughts and would like yours. As of right now Lee Sin signed is marked as sold on Tcg $1,200. Then ive seen ebay listings in fb group of Ahri $400ish and Voli $700ish My personal opinion is a good amount would be 2x value of what we see from Chinese market (closest counterpart). Im basing this off of Pokémons Japanese to English comparison. Japan being english pokemons closest counterpart. Also to get a signed card is around 30 boxes or 720 packs. When compared to something like Pokemon chase card the Unbreon Vmax which is about 1/2000 packs. I dont know the math on specific signatures, it might be higher. That card at that rarity sat at $600-$800 for longest time before the scalper boom past year and half. Now people might say wait... theres 15 signature card types, so pulling a specific one is significantly harder, so value should be higher. But i argue that the difference in Pokemon comparison is theres no cards (except rayquaza) from that set that came even close to the price point. So until the characters popularity come into play, they should all be around the same value and highly tradable. Just something to consider. Seeing the chinese market i would say English signature should be around $400-$600. That being said we saw what leesin sold and people are asking $2k already. But in a month hundreds of signed cards will flood the market cutting that in half or more id imagine. What are your thoughts?",

The only thing wrong with this card is the centering on the back is off right to left. I’ve taken this to card shops and to sports card conventions and the dealers who I’ve talked to who also grade cards have all said that this would be a minimum 8.5 on the grading system, just because the centering on the back. I’ve held onto this card since I got it in a pack when I was a freshman in high school in 79-80 waiting to sell it. It looks like a defect on the top but it’s the lighting and reflection. The edges are all clean, the colors are still bright, it’s centered on the front almost perfect. There are no spots. I’m just devastated with this grade. Do you think the graders were just having a bad day? I just don’t get it, especially comparing these images with the cards that have sold on Heritage auctions with some of the issue they have like centering which had much higher grades than this. Thanks in advance for any insight into this.",

    "text": "Burgerchu Tank Made a post last month that led to a good mix of agreement and disagreement. I presented strong evidence that burgerchu was only being held up by shill bidding, and that when volume pressure (constant PSA vault auction lots of 200+ slabs at once) forced the shill bidders to stop, price would tank and not stop tanking. I had thought an initial floor of $100, but looking at future auctions there are only more and more huge lots coming. When the dust settles, I wonder how many people think that buying these en masse at ~$50 would be a better use of capital than other cards. The card does have a more interesting “story” behind it and will be memorable going into the future, but the signs were clear that buying at 200 or even 300-400+ like many did was a terrible move in the present.",

    "text": "Never sell luxury items on eBay I’ve been selling on eBay for years, and for the most part, my experience has been fine. I’ve sold tons of low-priced items with little to no issue. But recently, when trying to sell a few luxury pieces, I had this feeling eBay never protect their sellers. I sold a Louis Vuitton bucket hat ealier this year. Without any communication at all, the buyer directly filed a dispute through their bank, not even through eBay, not even talked to me. There was no message, no reason, no return, just a chargeback. eBay said they would “fight for my rights as a seller, and talked to the bank” but after 3 months of waiting, 3 MONTH! I lost both the money and the item. No explanation, no follow-up, nothing. There’s absolutely no real seller protection when the buyer goes through their bank instead of eBay. The second time, I sold a Balenciaga hat (with the original receipt from the store). The buyer insisted it was fake because it didn’t look identical to another Balenciaga product he owned, which is absurd, since even within the same brand, manufacturing differences are normal. I accepted the return request just to resolve it peacefully. But then the buyer left me a huge negative review, all caps shouting “FAKE” in his review, extremely rude and completely baseless. EBay refused to remove this feedback, even though I had proof of authenticity and accepted the return. And of course, sellers aren’t allowed to leave any kind of negative review for buyers, so we just have to take it. I’ve learned my lesson. EBay is not a safe place to sell luxury items. There’s zero protection for sellers dealing with high-value goods. Buyers can make false claims, file chargebacks, and eBay will just shrug and say “we tried.” If you ever plan to sell anything designer or pricey, don’t use eBay. It’s not worth the stress or the loss.",

I convinced her to open both and I got the charizard! However I've noticed the price of the ETB go up in the past 4 months from 80 dollars for an ETB to 140-170, while the top chase card has always actually been cheaper than the price of an etb. As a preface, I want to say that I'm not a scalper or anything, I just like looking at the prices of the cards I have. I'm just curious as to what the supply/demand balance is here and why prices for the etb are so high.",

Sold an item earlier this summer, USPS had delivery delays while the item was in USPS possession, buyer asked eBay for a refund, eBay gave the buyer a refund, then the item was delivered. The buyer confirmed receipt of the item, the USPS tracking number shows the successful, but delayed, delivery. eBay said the dispute was ruled in my favor. Assumed everything would be paid out from there. Been calling eBay customer service every 10-15 days after delivery and they keep saying they'll send payment by way of the appeals department but no payment received. On a recent call I asked to elevate to management and the \"eBay Customer Service Leadership Team\" assured me nothing can be done to get paid for this delivered item. This person informed me that they were the highest level and proceeded to hang up on me. Any else experience this and have success getting paid?

    "text": "Update on My Missing Mega Charizard X EX From Whatnot “Qualitypulls”– Not Satisfied Hey everyone — just wanted to give an update on my situation with the Mega Charizard X EX SAR 110/080 (Japanese Inferno X) that I pulled on Whatnot back on October 7. USPS tracking (92001903478427300484215881) still shows the package was never accepted, meaning the seller never shipped my card. I sent Whatnot all the proof — tracking, screenshots, video of the pull, and even other buyer reviews showing similar issues with this same seller. After weeks of waiting, I finally got this response from Whatnot (screenshot attached). They determined the “market value” of my missing card is $720, refunded what I paid ($48.23), and gave me $671.77 in Whatnot credit. Here’s the problem: • The actual raw value of my card is around $750–$900, not $720. • Graded, the same card sells for $2,000+ (PSA 10) and up to $12,000 (BGS 10 Black Label). • And worst of all, it looks like the seller still has his account active, even though there are multiple reports of him doing the same thing to others. I appreciate Whatnot for at least responding, but this outcome doesn’t sit right. The platform basically gave me partial value in credit while the seller gets to keep a potentially $2,000+ card. That’s not justice. Buyers — please be careful out here. Scammers are getting smarter, and even when you have all the proof, you might still end up shortchanged. Whatnot needs to do better protecting its buyers. We spend real money on this platform, and scammers like this ruin the trust for everyone.",

Returns have always been part and parcel, however, recently every return which is requested and automatically accepted now results in eBay holding the funds until it's returned / refunded. Once upon a time this never happened, and very rarely you would get the odd one where they would hold the amount. Obviously this differs from opening a case, which to my knowledge has always resulted in money being held. Does anyone know why this is? It's extremely frustrating for cash flow, particularly when the item isn't returned back after 30 days. Thanks!",

It was the launch of the \"Secret Scare Superdrop,\" a highly sought-after collection of premium, limited-edition card sets. But within minutes, that anticipation devolved into a now-familiar ritual of frustration, futility, and fury. Customers who logged on at the 9 a.m. PST launch were thrust into a virtual queue, with wait times ticking into hours. The most agonizing part, however, wasn't the wait. It was the false hope. Multiple players reported the same crushing experience: after finally getting through the queue two hours later, they would successfully add the desired $40 bundles to their cart. They would proceed to checkout, enter their payment and shipping details, and click \"confirm.\" Only then would they be met with an error message: the items were sold out. Their carts were empty.

    "text": "Bought a Fake Card Through eBay’s Authentication Guarantee – eBay Refusing to Help Hi all, I recently purchased a Pokemon card on eBay that was covered under their Authentication Guarantee program. The card was authenticated by PSA and arrived sealed in the tamper proof packaging. However, upon inspection, it's clear that the card is a fake, (Static holo pattern, holo matches with TCGPlayer, 1st Edition stamp is not lined up properly) despite PSA marking it as authentic. I did not do my due diligence prior to purchasing due to it being through the Authentication Guarantee, now I wish I should have. I contacted eBay immediately. They redirected me to another department and unfortunately, they refused to offer a return or refund. Their reasoning was that they trust PSA’s authentication process and won’t override it, even in the case of a clear mistake. Here’s where I currently stand: * I’ve contacted PSA directly and am awaiting their response as they review the case. * The card remains sealed in its tamper proof packaging - I haven’t opened it to ensure the chain of custody is intact. * I'm considering a chargeback as a last resort, but I'd prefer to explore all possible avenues before going down that road. It’s frustrating that eBay’s authentication program which is supposed to protect buyers seems to leave no room for recourse when the authenticator gets it wrong. And ironically, PSA’s involvement has limited my ability to open a standard claim under eBay’s Money Back Guarantee. Any advice on next steps, other contacts, or how to escalate this situation? Thanks in advance.",

I was ecstatic. kept that card for 20 years. I recently restarted collecting cards and noticed that everything changed. the price are out of this world, there are 200 different flavors you can buy. and they are all upper-deck. after some digging I came to pinpoint the culprit to be the diamond classification upper deck attributes to a dealer. this essencially killed the moms and pops card shop, now only huge stores remain where there is pressure to buy and where the kids can't afford sh1t all and are seen as a semi-nuisance. it got me somewhat angry.. I hated my experience, in fact I buy exclusively online now, I have not traded or sold a card since I restarted a few years back because there are no community, events or places where you can exchange about your passion, beside online forums with mostly trolls. kids cannot use ebay, or any of these trading apps. kids do not work, kids cannot generate 13$/day to buy a pack of cards. how the hell, is this hobby supposed to survive if it behaves like amateur radio boomers. the kids are left aside.. the future of the hobby is trampled on (and as a byproduct, the ",

The TAG certification itself was valid — but the alteration wasn’t caught during their process. I have since removed it from the market, but it’s an expensive lesson. It shows that TAG-graded cards may require extra due diligence, as alterations can sometimes pass through their authentication. I don’t fault zandgemporium — they confirmed the cert and grade before listing, as they always do. My issue is that this type of oversight shouldn’t happen at the grading level. Please be cautious when buying TAG-graded cards and always verify with multiple sources if possible. I have contacted TAG about this and they do not seem inclined to explain or engage.",

One of the most common, if not the most common questions being asked by any new collector is “How much is this card worth”. Knowing the price of any card is useful when buying, selling or trading.

The aim is to help collectors prevent underselling cards or overpaying when buying the cards.

Alternatively, one can also use any search engine by typing the name of the Pokemon and the set number. This will usually give an image match with which the other details can be found out.

I see a LOT of heated discussion related to how TAG should be comped- Eventually I got tired of the debate and decided to kill 3-4 hours to know for sure. **I understand that a lot of TAG sellers / vendors abide by a PSA 85-95% rule** \\- however more often than not, *to those that aren't TAG collectors, its not something known, or believed.* ***Can the data back that rule up?*** # Problem Outline: * *Lack of historical data (Normative Authority) on Ebay Last Solds causes friction between buyers, vendors, and graders at Card Shows, Ebay, Facebook Marketplace, etc.* * Variation in price or outright exclusion of TAG in PriceCharting, Collectr, CardLadder, and other aggregators causes uncertainty and inability to reach comp agreements. **I want to start this series with Charizard EX #199, because:** * Extremely Popular Modern / Charizard -> It has an abundance of Sold Data * High Value <$1000 -> Big Liquidity # Data Controls: 1. TAG & PSA data was pulled using Ebay Research Seller Tool (public) from \\[7/14/25\\] to \\[10/13/25\\]. 2. Pulled data ONLY for \\[TAG10's\\] & \\[PSA10's\\]. 3. Filtered OUT RAW, BGS, CGC, (and other weird combo deals), etc. **Please NOTE the limitations for Data Analysis:** * **Data is unable to contextualize seller TAT (Turnaround Time)** * Ebay marketplace does not encompass all market activity, and the 13-15% seller fee is considerable drag for people wanting to list to Ebay. * Consider that a LARGE proportion of TAG sales happen offline at Card Shows, FB Marketplace, etc, but IRL markets calibrate to last solds. (I know this is normal, but it's actually insane to think about.) # Major Key Insights (aka TLDR): * **TAG 10 Slabs fetch an average 89% to their PSA 10 counterpart.** * **(Pre-Mania) -** *observing prices pre-pump $1k, the relative TAG to PSA comp range was narrow (82%-98%):* * Normal Thou",

When tracking details show that the item is delivered, we'll issue a refund to the buyer on your behalf. This case will not affect your seller performance.”* I was very clear that I was NOT accepting the return in the case I opened because the buyer already took apart the device AND SENT IMAGES OF IT OPENED IN THEIR RETURN REQUEST!!! and my listing was overly detailed and what the buyer claimed is not as described is very much in the listing Second of all what the F- you mean eBay is issuing the buyer a refund ON MY BEHALF once it’s delivered. How is this even legal for them to automatically give the money back without giving me a chance to inspect they put the device back together properly!?!? Edit: I may add it’s been 3 days since eBay made their case decision but the buyer hasn’t shipped it back. Is there a time threshold where the case automatically closes?

Absolutely ridiculous AND they kept the 500$ selling fee so now not only do I have to give back the 2500$ payout but I need to somehow come up with 500$ to pay eBay or else they send it to collections.

    "text": "Most ‘I Buy Sports Cards’ Buyers Disappear When You Mention eBay Sold Prices 😅😭 I recently messaged about 20 local buyers who advertise that they purchase sports cards. I told them I have a large collection with many high value pieces. For several of them, I even sent photos of some of my better cards. Almost all of them asked whether I had cards of specific players (including rookies), and I said yes. In the end, I explained that my collection is very large I have cards from almost every sport and many players. I said if someone wants to buy in person, I’m willing to sell below market, roughly 70% of market value for most items, and I’d do my best to make a deal. I also said I would price based on recent eBay sold listings. As soon as I mentioned eBay sold comps, most of them lost interest. So I’m asking, do these people actually want to buy cards... or are they trying to pressure sellers into letting valuable collections go at unreasonably low prices? Unfortunately, scammers and predatory buyers are everywhere. Please be careful. My advice to fellow collectors _Don’t let strangers set your prices. Always check recent eBay sold listings (not asking prices) and use that as your baseline. _Know your range. If you need quick cash, decide your discount in advance (e.g., 70–85% of market depending on card/liquidity). Don’t let someone talk you down further on the spot. _Meet safely & in public if selling locally. _Be cautious with “I buy collections” posts. 🚨😅 Many of these buyers only want deep discounts far below comps. If someone refuses to use sold data, that’s a red flag. _Remember you have options. If you’re patient, you can sell online a little below market and still do better than a lowball local offer. Stay safe, do your own research, and protect the value of your collection",

    "text": "Warning to all buyers: my nightmare experience buying “fine jewellery” on eBay – and why you should never do it - eBay will screw you I want to share a cautionary tale that almost cost me over **$1,500**, to warn everyone considering buying jewellery on eBay. Even though I’ve been a loyal eBay member for 13+ years, I was left completely unprotected until PayPal finally stepped in. In August purchased a necklace on **eBay Germany** listed in the *Fine Jewellery (Echtschmuck)* category as **750 (18k) gold**. The chain itself was hallmarked “750,” which by law means 18 karat. However, when I received it, I did the responsible thing: I had it **professionally tested** by a jeweller — and it turned out to be *fake*. Not 18k, not even close. A counterfeit with an illegal hallmark. * In **Germany (Feingehaltsgesetz)** and the EU, falsely hallmarked gold is **illegal**. * eBay’s own Jewellery Policy states: “Gold, silver, and platinum items must meet applicable laws for stamping.” When I reported the issue and filed a case, eBay: 1. **Initially told me** I was protected under their *Money Back Guarantee*, and that the seller had to provide a return label. 2. The seller ignored all messages and never sent a label. 3. eBay’s own staff confirmed several times that I would be refunded once the seller failed to act. But then came the absurd twist: eBay closed the case in the *seller’s favour* because I had **tested the item**. Mind you I had the piece tested at a local jewellery store using XRF, a non-destructive method. In other words: * If I **don’t test** it, I can’t prove it’s fake. * If I **do test** it (responsibly and legally), using non-destructive method, I “void” my protection. A complete *Catch-22*. After denying my refund, eBay quietly **removed the seller’s account** — “no longer a registered member.” Usually sellers who want to close their account must wait at the minimum 6 months from their last transaction. Therefore, the fact that this seller being de-platformed",

The listing did not include a chain, and I have a specific disclaimer in my listings that anything other than the main item (props, other pieces of jewelry etc) are *not* included in the listing. I had some extra 925 nib chains, so I tossed one in as a free gift. Cause it's a pendant and a chain would be nice if they needed one, right? The item passed authentication but failed because it didn't match photos. Because of the free chain I added. This was verified by CS. The buyer didn't even have the choice to accept or reject, it was just automatically sent back. Maybe I'm just stupid or naive, idk. But now I've lost money and a sale in a very slow moving market.",

    "text": "Should I consider quitting day job to manage my Fathers auto junk yard business? So I recently bought a home closer to my father (due to wanting to be closer to him and cheaper cost of living).He also helped me with the down payment. I live in Stockton and I commute to Sunnyvale 3 times a week taking the train and I work from home Monday and Friday. My job isn’t stressful per se but there’s not a lot of room to grow and I’ve reached my full potential there. The biggest problem is the pay and I make about 4900 and 3700 after taxes and health insurance. My father said he can start me at 5k a month managing his business and up to 10k once I’m established and good. It’s hard to not take up the offer since I commute 2 1/2 hours each way and working for him it’ll only be 40 min. I’m just wondering if it’ll be a stressful transition considering I don’t do much at my job but I feel like I also don’t have a sense of purpose and it’s easy to be stagnant and complacent here. All my coworker friends moved on to different places and we only average 15 people in office when we should have about 40 people show up. Should I take my dad’s offer and start fresh? I’m also passionate about cars and I do DIY fixes here and there. He said he’s willing to let me work there for a month as a trial to see if I like it. TLDR:I should also mention I’m a subcontractor employee and don’t work directly with the company. I’m just torn about switching my career path to manage the business. Should I do it? My dad has always been generous with helping me financially and I see this as an opportunity to always grow since it’s a business. Update: it’s my first week and I feel like I’ve been learning everything really fast. From fixing the eBay listings to more competitive prices. To using our inventory software to add new parts and knowing which parts go into which container. I think within a month I’ll get the hang of things.",

It was in a one touch that had the Breakers logo covering the magnet. The sticker was put on all totally crooked and there was nothing on the card that it was an official topps autographed card. The guy got mad because I wouldn't take it. Later on that day I found out some company or breakers have the rights to buy signed sticker sheets and put them on cards. I had never heard of that. I am trying to show my boss an example of one of these cards. I found one from the same company on ebay yesterday while looking up the specific card I was looking at in the shop, but I can't find the listing now. If anyone can help me find the listing, I would be really grateful. Im pretty sure it was the base card #ra-jwo. It was still in the one piece with the breaker sticker and it had the crooked sticker like the one that was in my store. Being that was the only listing I could find it sort of justified my thinking that something wasn't right.",

First, the inventory doesn't seem to be as good as it used to be. Second, if anything is good it is often over priced trying to drive you to sellers web age. Third, if I do find what looks to be a decent auction I always seem to lose as \"second highest bidder\". This last one happens so often now it has to be something fishy (even though I don't have proof). I also used to frequent the CGC forum's, inventory also seems scarce there. Are people just sitting on big books because market is down? I know about ComicLink, MyComicShop, and Heritage but would prefer more eBay style auctions. I personally hate social media so don't do Instagram, or whatnot. The later I can't stand you can barely inspect the book before someone buys. I want good pictures, not someone holding it in front of a camera for 5 seconds telling me what the grade is. I want a chance to grade it myself. I just tried FB Marketplace but frankly good stuff is rare where I live. Am I missing someplace, where did all the eBay buyers/sellers go? Feels like the online market is splintered and while I hated eBay for fees, it was a pretty safe place for buyers and it was kind of nice almost everyone/thing was there.",

I sent in some pokemon cards to be graded through my local GameStop and was told it would take about 2.5 months to turnaround and come back. The problem started when my pro account attached to the submission was deleted and I was told it can’t be restored, it’s been over three months since I sent my cards in to be graded and they came back to the store around a month to a month and a half ago, the store says they cannot give me any of my cards because the submission no longer exists. They first told me they had to get clearance from psa (which never happened) and then told me they could transfer the submission over to another account so they could mark the cards as picked up. I was told the transfer to the other account would take around 48 business hours and it’s now been about 3 weeks since that conversation. I’ve tried calling them to discuss any other steps we could take but have been met with lukewarm responses or a “sorry there is nothing we can do”. I have honestly ran out of patience and would really just like the cards I submitted and got graded back. Is there anything I can do as the customer and owner of the cards? TLDR: I submitted my cards over 3 months ago and I’m not allowed to pick them up, what should I do?",

    "text": "Unearthed Gold Star Rayquaza from Childhood Collection I recently found my Gold Star Rayquaza from my childhood collection and I'm trying to figure out the best next step. I've seen recent raw sales on eBay for cards in what looks to be similar or worse condition sell for between $7,000 and $9,000. I'm weighing that against the pros and cons of grading. I'm considering the grading fees, the cost of insuring it for shipping (twice), and the stress of mailing a high-value card. This is before even considering the final seller fees on a platform like eBay. I've never submitted a card for grading before. Based on the photos in the album, what do you think the potential grade range for this card could be? What would you do in my position? Grade it, or sell it as is? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! UPDATE: Wow thanks for all the replies here. After receiving a lot of messages, and reading your posts here I decided to pursue grading the card. Special shoutout to [u/Dracanherz](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dracanherz/) for the IRL **'PSA drop-off event -> PSA Vault' strategy.** I'm running with that... as it removes the shipping concern I had. If I remember I'll come back here and update everyone what the grade ended up being. Thanks again!",

I couldn’t provide any input there because I am banned by who I have to assume to be paid shills as they refuse to allow any posts that are original or think outside the box in while admitting is not always 100% predictability of the discussion Please take a moment to read this post by Alex Rampell (@arampell) — one of the managing partners at a16z, which has been confirmed as a partner in the TikTok acquisition talks. https://x.com/arampell/status/1562557849128931328?s=46 Rampell describes how his team turned around a struggling company by doing three “unorthodox” things: 1. Promoted from within 2. Spun out a company via IRS Section 355 (tax-free dividend to shareholders) 3. Sold IP to unlock value The most interesting part? The spinout. By taking one product, wrapping it into a new entity, flattening prefs, and giving the team equity upside, they created a second exit where none existed. That example should immediately make us think of GameStop. 1. The GameStop OMSA — May 17, 2024 Thanks to u/Idjek on Reddit for digging up this filing. In GME’s Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies (Exhibit 1.1), the company explicitly defines Digital Assets as including: “...currencies, coins or tokens... whose ownership or transmission is recorded or verified by a distributed ledger (including a blockchain or DAG) or other similar technology.” Why would a videogame retailer hardwire blockchain/DAG language into its equity sale agreement? Not boilerplate. It looks like regulatory groundwork for tokenized shares or a spinoff entity. 2. The “New Class” anomaly (September 2024) Credit to @sboho on X for surfacing this, and shoutout to @TheBronxViking + @DominosJack for broker/vendor confirmations. Around September 9, 2024 (day before earnings), brokerages briefly displayed “GME Class New” shares. Schwab reps admitted this classification came from their q",

I can't help but wonder how many of these could be out there. There's very few sales of the first run with the GOAT promos, most coming from Heritage Auctions.

    "text": "ULPT: Ebay's 30 day funds hold and how to potentially get around it This is both a warning and a tip for those who weren't warned soon enough. Warning: Ebay lets you sell your first few items and receive payment upon delivery but after a few they then add you to their \"new seller policy\" which requires that your funds be held for 30 days, a rule they refuse to bend or break. If you are like me, unaware of the wait with bills coming up within those 30 days, this becomes a big issues. Tip: To get around this requires putting yourself out there and trusting a stranger but I imagine if you're desperate like I was it's worth it. You can simply message the buyer by going back to your inbox and say that though the funds processed you are still having and issue receiving funds due to policy and would like to discuss further it over email. Then you can ask them to request a return/refund and when they do you will choose the \"offer refund\" option so the buyer can keep the item. Once the refund is processed on their end they can then send you the money over venom or cashapp or whatever. I'm well aware that this isn't going to work every time and relies heavily on the kindness of strangers to not just get straight up robbed but at least its a potential solution where there was none (all of my frantic searching just showed a bunch of people saying there's nothing to be done). I personally am at a point though where I'd rather a random person screw me over than a mega corp and for me it was worth the risk. edit: read where i said this isnt gonna work every time and is reliant heavily on luck/kindness before commenting edit 2: man i forgot how cynical redditors are. yall have fun with that...",

    "text": "We built a portfolio tracker to solve our collecting chaos, and we're opening Beta to fellow collectors Dear r/collectors Community, We are three friends passionate about collecting (started with Magic cards, now we're into everything from Pokémon to sports cards) who quit our day jobs late last year to fulfill an old dream of starting our own company. After years of collecting and trading at events across the US, we kept encountering the same problems every serious collector faces. Tracking our collection values was a mess of spreadsheets. Organizing potential trades meant juggling eBay sold listings, price guides, and scattered notes. And we never really knew our portfolio's true performance over time. **Sound familiar?** So we built CardNexus - a modern portfolio tracker designed specifically for collectors who actually care about the value and organization of their collections. **What we've built so far:** * 🆓 A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch) * 💸 Real-time price syncing across multiple marketplaces * 📊 Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early * 🗂️ Custom lists for trading, selling, or just organizing your collection * 🌍 Multi-category support: TCGs (Magic, Pokémon, Lorcana) and soon sports cards **This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on collector feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 8 weeks ago with the TCG community, but we're expanding to serve the broader collecting world. Today, we're opening 200 beta spots for r/collectors ! We're offering a **$200 collectibles credit** (your choice - TCGPlayer, eBay, or whatever marketplace you prefer) to one lucky member who joins via our link, uploads their collection, and creates a trade/sell list! **Get your invite here** —> [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=collectors](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=collectors) Our marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker w",

I had all my cards from the 80/90s stolen but recently started to get interested in collecting a handful of my favorite players.

As soon as you have access to all 3 main areas getting the vault key fragments and doing the vaults should be your top priority. In total, completing all 3 vaults gives the following to your glide pack: - recharges twice as fast - starts recharging twice as fast - consumes 50% less charge Put together, this results in a massive boost to your mobility both in and out of combat. This is especially relevant when fighting enemies with the Centripedal modifier, as having 4 dashes instead of 2 makes it far easier to escape the singularities. The loot from the vault bosses is nothing special and they may be more difficult for you depending on where your build is at but they are also worth farming if you want a legendary class mod for your class as they have them as part of their dedicated loot pool.",

    "text": "No Update or Refund on Missing Beckett Grading Services Card Submission After a Whole Year. [Advice] Hey all, As the title suggest I submitted card for grading through Beckett Grading Services (BGS) and have not heard anything about them in almost a year despite me talking to multiple customer service representatives to work and try to resolve this issue. I will try to refrain from insulting BGS throughout this post. Back in October of 2024 I submitted my first round of cards to get graded. I decided to grade though BGS since they were attending a local con near me and it would be easy to submit in-person with first party BGS reps. I submitted 11 cards from the Stellar Crown set paid in-person for the base service w/subgrades and insurance. **December 2024:** I saw my order appear through the website and listed as \"pending\" so i assumed that they were received and in the process of being graded. **February 2025:** I emailed customer service and they said I had an outstanding balance on my account despite me already paying in person. I provided receipts and order form. They assured me that they would locate my order. and get back to me. **# of** **BGS reps investigating order : 1** **March-April 2025:** I submit multiple customer service tickets that receive no reply. Eventually my order disappears off the BGS website all together. I write multiple customer service tickets to BGS asking for an explanation but crickets. **May 2025:** I attend another con where BGS is in attendance and go and talk to a sales rep attending and explained the situation. The sales rep was able to confirm my order but was not able to explain what had happened to my order. The sales rep gave me their contact info and assured me they would investigate my order personally. **# of** **BGS reps investigating order : 2** **June 2025:** I email back and forth with the sales rep and they assure me that they are initiating a refund and that another customer service rep will me looking into my order ",

I know it’s real because my mom bought these cards back in 1999 and we’ve had them ever since. The buyer messaged me saying he peeled the top layer off and that meant it was fake, but then left negative feedback saying the card “showed up peeling.” His own words don’t even match what he posted. He also told me if I just refunded his money he wouldn’t leave negative feedback. When I told him I wouldn’t refund until the card was returned since he admitted to damaging it, he left the negative review anyway and still hasn’t sent the card back. After I pushed back, he sent another message saying he tried peeling an old Poliwag from the 90s and “couldn’t peel it with pliers” so that proves mine is fake. I’ve reported him to eBay for feedback extortion but I haven’t heard back yet. My questions: has anyone else dealt with a buyer peeling apart a WOTC holo and then claiming it’s counterfeit? Do authentic holos peel like this if someone forces it? Ive attached photos from my eBay listing, the pics he sent along with the messages.",

    "text": "PSA 6 turned PSA 10??? PSA I need clarity. Months ago I submitted a Zekrom & Pikachu Tag Team promo. At the time of submission, the card was worth around $550-$600 in a 10. Weeks after I sent it in, the explosion of tag teams happened and this card over doubled in price to $1400 in a 10. Being super pumped that my card was going to be a lot more than it was when I submitted it. I couldn’t wait for it to be finished. Time goes by, I received report that my card got a 6. I thought there was absolutely no way that could be true. When I received the card I immediately broke it out of the slab and examined it under a very expensive microscope for literally 2 hours straight. Nothing. Just a virtually “perfect” card to PSA’s standards. (Btw on the pics, the black spec on the back is not actually on the card) I made a post questioning why it got a 6 and said I’d be resubmitting for a 9-10. Fast forward to today, I got the report back. GEM MT 10. Nothing about the card was changed or altered. It’s the same exact card that received as a 6. The price is now down $350 from what it was a month and a half ago when I received it initially. As an effect of their “misjudgment”, I missed out on good money, (selling amount and grading fees). This submission was expedited. So in total, I’ve spent $100 on grading just this card alone. I’m severely unhappy with their judgement. As a long time PSA user, I’ve had multiple inconsistencies with them in the last 4-5 months. For the time being, I will no longer be using PSA. 100% Perfect cards will go to BGS, Near perfect cards will go to TAG. I understand TAG is very new to Pokemon and is still working on a lot of things. I will be experimenting with them. But it’s really about clarity and seeing what’s wrong with my card. Rather than getting told my card is a 6 and to give them money. Guess what? They paid me $1,017 for the same exact card they told me was “valued at $86”!",

    "text": "Pokémon card prices have reached an absurd level. A Pikachu Illustrator card was just sold on eBay for $4 million! These cards are considered the rarest of all Pokémon cards – they were released in 1998 as a prize for the winners of a contest in Japan, with a print run of just 41 copies. These days, the price of cards depends on their condition, and the one just sold graded a PSA 9, which is very close to perfect (PSA 10). It's worth noting that just a week ago, the exact same card in the same condition was sold for \"only\" $625,000. And it should be added that four million for a Pokémon is still not a record, as in 2022, the -popular vlogger Logan Paul paid $5.25 million for an \"Illustrator\" card. That card, however, was in perfect condition. >More about games in our community.

However, one card has been stuck on \"shipped to PSA vault\" for a long time, and I have not received the confirmation that the card is \"Vaulted\" by PSA. The other problem is that this card never said \"To Vault\" in the PSA app like most cards to when in transit, though it did automatically appear in my collection. I contacted PSA about this issue and they gave me a canned response saying that the card is indeed secured in the vault, but attached to the wrong email. They suggest I make an account to link ebay to PSA, but I have obviously already done that. I used the same ebay email and everything (which is done automatically) that I always do, this cannot possibly be my fault. I'm waiting on their response, but this does not seem promising.

I do weekly payouts and they’re usually $1300-$2500 per week. My last payout was $800. It’s Sunday today and as of now this week’s payout will be maybe $400. I’m still listing new items, about 5 per day. My inventory has not changed very much and the things I normally sell multiple of per week (a lot of my inventory is multiple quantity, ie 1 listing with 200 available) aren’t selling at all. The only thing that has changed (my metrics are still outstanding) is I have an open eBay international return that’s about $300. The item was fully operational, sold through the international program. After shipping I get an item not received 2 weeks later. eBay received it and shipped to customer but it was still en route. 2 days later customer opens a return. I don’t know the reason for the return since eBay is handling it. When I click on details it only says eBay is handling it. Part of me thinks the customer opened the return before receiving since there were shipping delays. eBay will end up paying the customer back the $300, not me. Is it possible this return has throttled my sells or is it just a coincidence. It’s strange they coincided with one another and I just can’t see any other reason. Anyone experience something similar. Lastly, the sells I am getting are all really low value. $10-$20. I usually get a few big ticket items ($150+) per week. That hasn’t happened for weeks now.",

For those unaware a 30 yr old can will not be full i feel like it’s common sense but also “science” Of course eBay sided w buyer wo even contacting me. I sent this message: It’s astonishing that I even have to explain this, but here we are: a 30-year-old collectible Pepsi can is not something you purchase expecting a fresh, fizzy drink inside. Anyone with even the slightest grasp of common sense (or of how time works) should understand that after three decades, cans often lose their contents through natural seepage or evaporation. I accurately listed and sold a collectible can, not a beverage to quench your thirst. If you were under the impression that you’d be cracking it open for a refreshing sip of 1990s Pepsi, then the mistake is entirely yours, not mine. Next time, I suggest reading the description carefully and maybe asking yourself whether a 30-year-old soda can is meant for drinking—or for collecting.",

I shipped out maybe a month ago $250 worth of Pokemon cards to a buyer (who has very high ratings, trusted buyer) and they reached out about not receiving their package. So I did everything I could in my power to contact USPS and also contact EBAY. We all know how impossible both of these can be to work with as EBay is unresponsive and won’t even let you talk to them and USPS’ website is ancient doesn’t work half the time and I don’t think they will help me if the package officially says ‘delivered’ in their system. So even with insurance on the package, I don’t think I can get my money back from USPS. If I’m wrong about that point me in the right direction. I told the buyer to mark the item as ‘not received’ because EBay would not let me contact them or make any changes until a case was made. Which gave me 3 days to update tracking/talk to my buyer, which I did. The tracking on USPS’ official site says delivered and shows all of the tracking updates. eBay did not show all the tracking updates and just says ‘out to delivery to authenticator’. I don’t even know what an authenticator is or is needed for considering the cards are graded, and I’ve sold a 1k card and did not have this stupid process go on. Me and my buyer are extremely confused and feel like eBay just snapped up our extremely expensive purchase and is preventing us from working with them. I don’t know if somehow USPS is wrong when I feel their tracking is usually reliable, so I’m favored to believe EBay is messing something up on their end. They emailed me today that they sided with the buyer (clearly didn’t read anything about our case) and issued a full refund. Now I’m screwed out of my childhood cards and the cash I really needed. What the hell do I do. Update 1: Now I’ve received an over $40 charge to my bank account because that’s how much eBay decided to overcharge my b",

Searching sold listings will give you accurate comp prices that people are actually paying. **1/1 cards** For 1/1s you need to research card sales from the same player.

    "text": "How to find the value of your sports cards If you're looking for the value of a card, there are a couple simple resources to help with this. **Search on 130point** [https://130point.com/sales/](https://130point.com/sales/) Use any info you have about the card: Player name, brand, card number, year etc **Use eBay advanced search** [https://www.ebay.com/sch/ebayadvsearch](https://www.ebay.com/sch/ebayadvsearch) Make sure you tick the box for 'Sold listings' since people can list prices as whatever they want. Searching sold listings will give you accurate comp prices that people are actually paying. **1/1 cards** For 1/1s you need to research card sales from the same player. Look for other 1/1 cards with similar traits like brand, year, league, patch/auto etc. Then set a relative price yourself. \\---- Bookmark some of these helpful guides: **Determine the value of your trading cards** [https://sundocards.com/resources/determine-the-value-of-your-trading-cards/](https://sundocards.com/resources/determine-the-value-of-your-trading-cards/) **How to value your trading cards** [https://sundocards.com/how-to-value-your-trading-cards-a-beginners-step-by-step-guide/](https://sundocards.com/how-to-value-your-trading-cards-a-beginners-step-by-step-guide/) **Should I hold or sell?** [https://sundocards.com/resources/trading-cards-should-i-hold-or-sell/](https://sundocards.com/resources/trading-cards-should-i-hold-or-sell/) **Should I get this card graded?** [https://sundocards.com/resources/should-i-get-this-trading-card-graded/](https://sundocards.com/resources/should-i-get-this-trading-card-graded/) **Guide to PSA grading** [https://sundocards.com/resources/guide-to-psa-card-grading/](https://sundocards.com/resources/guide-to-psa-card-grading/) **Guide to refractors, parallels and foils** [https://sundocards.com/resources/the-complete-guide-to-types-of-parallels-refractors-and-holographic-hologram-trading-cards/](https://sundocards.com/resources/the-complete-guide-to-types-of-p",

    "text": "I’m pretty new to magic, I started last month with a friend and we’ve been enjoying it so far. He got into it cause of arena and the collabs, while I got into it because I love Final Fantasy, especially FF7. So because of my love for FF and FF7, I naturally want to collect all the FF7 cards. So I went onto tcgplayer and looked at the Sephiroth cards. I saw the full art Fabled Soldier and instantly fell in love with the look of the card but the price threw me off. $70 for a card seems so insane to me that I threw away the idea right away. So fast track to today, I go to a card shop to just go look around and maybe get a commander set or a few singles and that’s when I saw the full art foil borderless Sephiroth Fabled Soldier. I asked how much it was and ofc it was $75. I said that’s a bit much for me and went home. When I got home I was talking to my mom about it and how I don’t understand why cards are so expensive. Just normal talk yk. Well she went out to get groceries and without me knowing, went to the card shop and asked about it. Well she bought it, she bought the $75 card. I’m very grateful and I was extremely happy but now I feel guilty. I don’t like that she bought it because it bothers me that she spent $75 on a card when that money could’ve been used for something else. I’ve been thinking of returning the card and getting her money back because even though I love the card, I can’t even touch it without feeling wrong. Ik it’s just a card and in all reality it’s not that deep but I bothers me so much that I would much rather shred the card than keep it at this point. What do you guys think? Do you think I’m overthinking and overreacting? TLDR: Mom buys $75 card and I want to return it because spending that much on a card makes me feel terrible and the fact I didn’t buy it using my own money is eating at me. (Edit) I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did. I am having trouble answering all 600+ people in the comments but I want everyone to know that I app",

    "text": "Just wanted to share my negative experience with \"Break'n Bad\" on fanatics live as an FYI to others. Since July I have spent over $925 with that shop purchasing various online cards breaks including one where I paid a little over $37 for a Topps Chrome Jumbo pack. I received the package on time but it only contained cards pulled from other orders I placed with them and no Jumbo Pack (I did receive a second Jumbo Pack I bought in a separate purchase/shipment just fine the same week). I messaged them through the fanatics site, got a couple replies including \"our shipping team may have just missed including that pack\", but its now been a week with no follow-up or resolution from them. I just filed a complaint with Fanatics, hoping they can help get this resolved, but its a let down to spend that much money with someone only to end up getting ignored when things go wrong. That's not the customer service someone would expect when a company drops the ball. Until this point, my experience with them was otherwise positive, but when someone doesn't fix their mistake that's a deal breaker for me, so I will not be purchasing again from them and will likely stop the whole site altogether, if fanatics can't make it right. Update 9/16/25: I filed a claim with Fanatics-live as previously stated (who responded very quickly) and received an update from the shop shortly thereafter (not sure if it was cause-and-effect or not). Just got a replacement jumbo pack from the shop, so they did ultimately make good on their end. Overall, its good to see both the shop and fanatics provide resolution, but it did unfortunately result in having to jump through several extra hoops on my side.",

    "text": "Dear r/mtgfinance Community, We are three friends passionate about Magic (and a few more TCGs since then) who quit our day jobs late last year to fulfill an old dream of starting our own company. After years of playing Magic competitively and trading cards at events across the US, we kept running into the same problems. Tracking our collection values was a mess of spreadsheets. Organizing trades meant juggling TCGPlayer tabs and scattered notes. And we never really knew our portfolio's true performance over time. So we built CardNexus - a modern portfolio tracker designed specifically for serious TCG players and collectors who care about value. **What we've built for MTG:** * A free collection tracker that will always stay free (no bait and switch) * Week-on-week portfolio tracking - see how your collection's value changes over time * Real-time price tracking synced with the two major marketplaces * Daily/weekly movers dashboard to spot trends early * Custom lists for trades and deck building * Support for all MTG formats and sets (plus 5 other TCGs if you're diversified, such as Sorcery, Flesh and Blood, One Piece, Lorcana, and Pokemon) **This isn't just our weekend project.** We've been heads-down for 6 months and are shipping updates weekly based on user feedback in our Discord. We soft-launched 7 weeks ago and have started sharing our tool with the smaller TCG communities but we feel that the time has come to share it with the MTG community. **Today, we're opening 200 beta spots specifically for the** r/mtgfinance **community.** **The hook:** We're giving away a $200 MTG booster box (your choice from TCGPlayer) to one lucky member who joins via our link, uploads their collection, and creates a trade list! Get your invite here: [https://cardnexus.com/?utm\\_campaign=mtgfinance](https://cardnexus.com/?utm_campaign=mtgfinance) Our marketplace launches end of the year, but the collection tracker will stay free forever.

    "text": "So I bought a sandworm... Yeah, there it is one of those LJN sandworms from the 80s. These are rare you hardly ever find one in a box and this one was still new in boxes as you can see, he’s still tied down. When the box arrived, it was open. The glue seams had separated, and when I looked inside, I saw the age spotting on this sandworm I contacted the seller to ask if he happens to know anything about this and he spent an hour and a half threatening me and berating me in messages. I shouldn’t have been surprised, but I kind of was - I mean I’ve come to expect the worst in people, especially in recent years, but this guy was really upset and at one point he said - I will fight a return on this Also, and this is important he didn’t offer a photo in the auction of the worm inside the box. The box clearly was open. He could’ve done so. I felt he might be trying to hide the age spotting, though I didn’t say so, and I didn’t accuse him of that . Well, he had been so rude that I thought I’ll just open a return, so I did and I explained and here’s photos, and I uploaded 10 photos and I selected that the item was damaged on receipt and 10 minutes later, the buyer closed the return and eBay didn’t do anything. I’m assuming I should’ve selected item not as described and that’s why this happened and I doubt that there’s anything I can do at this point, I’m out several hundred dollars if so, - but it is a rare LJN sandworm it’s still tied down in box. The box is still there. There are worse things. This impolite fellow said he’s had this thing since he bought it new in the 90s. As an eBay seller who’s been at it for longer than most I am never rude to a customer in messages. I never argue. I never threaten. I don’t use four letter words. I don’t use 10 letter words because sometimes too many words are hard for people to deal with and I doubt people read very well when I write these messages in the first place. They certainly don’t read descriptions or look at photos very well. ",

(i will post the convo in comments below) i know ebay isn't going to do anything about it so i at least want to warn other collectors because they've already sold 71 of these and not one person has left a review confirming or denying authenticity. good luck out there, and peep the photos of this product listing & our conversation below",

They gave it to me and it led to a BGS Charizard 8.5 1st edition. Okay checks out right? Oh wait, but then I notice that the sub grades are different than the one in the listing! Look for yourself. 3rd: BGS says THICK STAMP. Listing says THIN. 4th: They were in the UK. I’ve seen other posts of fake cards coming from there. Probably makes getting money back + returns harder. 5th: Listing only had one photo. No back photo. 6th: Sellers past items have never been cards. Last review was from over a year ago. If I was scamming, I would probably buy an old account that has a positive feedback history instead of a new account. Anyone have any thoughts? Are these red flags not valid?",

    "text": "I tracked every penny on 50 card sales. eBay's \"13.25%\" fee is a lie, and it's costing you thousands. Hey everyone, Like many of you, I run a side-hustle flipping sports cards. For months, I've had this nagging feeling that I was working my tail off for profits that just didn't seem to add up. I got fed up with the guesswork, so I ran an experiment. I took a batch of 50 mid-value hockey cards and decided to track *everything*. What I found was grim, but it provides some clarity on why so many of us feel like we're on a hamster wheel. **Part 1: The Time Sink is Real.** Just tracking the raw time to get 50 cards from a sorted box to \"sold and shipped\": * Photography: 2.1 hours * Research & Pricing: 2.5 hours * Listing Creation: 3.3 hours * Packaging & Shipping: 2.9 hours * **Total: Nearly 11 hours of actual work.** That's over 13 minutes of pure labor per card. By day three, I was so burned out on the operational grind I couldn't even look at another card. **Part 2: What I actually paid in fees was 17.6%** This is the part that should make you angry. I took one of my better sales—a **$35 card** where the buyer paid **$5 shipping**—and broke down every single cost: * Started with **$40 gross revenue**. * eBay's Final Value Fee: **-$5.67** (They charge 13.25% on the TOTAL including shipping and tax, which is how the number gets so inflated). * Per-Order Fixed Fee: -$0.30 * Promoted Listing Fee: -$1.07 (Basically mandatory to get seen). * Actual Shipping Cost: -$5.00 * Packaging Materials: -$0.75 After all that, I had **$27.21 left from my \"$35 sale.\"** The advertised 13.25% fee is total BS. My **True Effective Fee Rate** on the revenue I received was **17.6%**. Nearly one in five dollars vanished into a black box of fees. I'm laying this all out because I'm tired of guessing. I'm working on a better way to handle all this, but I wanted to share the raw numbers first. I'm curious if this matches what other high-volume sellers are seeing. How are you guys tracking this st",

Based on whatever card you hit, you can vault it, do an immediate sale which is usually very fair on more “liquid” cards. NO NEED TO MAIL IT TO YOURSELF TO TRY TO SELL IT AND WASTE A LOT OF TIME. immediate sale! if you link your GameStop and psa account, your collection will instantly show up on the psa app and you still get psa offers too! You can sell directly on there too or just list it for auction or buy price on eBay! love how GameStop is modernizing card collections and chases. In my honest opinion, much better odds of hitting decent cards compared to opening packs of Pokémon! PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GIVE IT A TRY! WISH YALL THE BEST OF LUCK!",

    "text": "New collector looking for help! Back when the first chapter came out I bought 2 starter decks and some packs. Didn’t pull anything amazing but still had fun collecting! Then life got real busy and my cards collected dust. Fast forward two years I saw all the cool new sets and want to start collecting again. My goal is to have a mostly complete binder for each set (minus the enchanteds and expensive legendaries and promos). I’ve already placed 2 cheap orders from TCGplayer. One with 60 commons, uncommons, rares from the first chapter to help fill in gaps in my collection and one with 2 d100 cards with nice art! I’ve compared prices between eBay and tcgplayer and it seems buying singles from tcg is much cheaper with a better selection! I know some basic rules like make sure the seller has good reviews and a decent amount of sales. Is there anything else I should know about the website to avoid fakes and get good value? I’m not looking for future resell value but I am trying to not overspend and get the best bang for my buck since I have a lot of catching up to do. I know to not buy sets right at release and wait for the market to settle. I’m familiar with the timing of the sports card market but this is a whole new world lol. The store championship Mirabel enchanted caught my eye since I loved encanto but I’m wondering if $~17 is a good price for it? It seems it’s continued to fall ever since release. With it being a rarely played card will it continue to fall lower and I can get it for $10 in the future? Or with store champs for that set over and all copies being given out will it rise back up? I know things are hard to predict but any guide/tips are appreciated! Thanks so much for reading",

    "text": "How I turned a 400$ commercial zero turn to 2,000$ (my 4th mower flip) Picked up this 2007 Yazoo Kees Mid Max commercial zero turn mower after talking the seller down from $750 to $400. It wasn’t some blown-up, hopeless project, the motor already ran fine. The seller just couldn’t keep it mowing because it kept shredding belts (likely from improper routing). When I got it, the mower was dirty and unable to move under its own power. The motor itself ran strong, so I figured it was worth the gamble. I ended up replacing the drive belt and putting on a deck belt, swapped in a new ignition solenoid and 25A fuse (one-time issue I tracked down), added some fuel stabilizer/cleaner to flush out old gas gunk, and eventually had to put on new rear tires after puncturing one while mowing my own yard (previous where already tubed and dry rotted, but did hold air) Total labor was maybe 6 hours spread over a weekend. After cleaning it up and putting about 8 hours of mowing on it myself, I listed it and sold for $2,000 cash in just two weeks. The numbers worked out great: purchase price was $400, total parts and supplies were about $400, so I was all-in for $800. Sold for $2,000, which left me with a $1,200 profit. This was my fourth riding mower flip, and honestly the smoothest. And I’m nowhere near done so expect to see more from this page!",

She spent decades amassing this mega-collection of Beanie Babies, ranging from the ultra-rare to run-of-the-mill and everything in between. I never saw a single beanie baby in her home, I don’t know where she was storing them all those years, all I know is that a few years ago I inherited a room-full of plastic bins containing about 2000 (mostly) mint condition beans, and their fate was now intertwined with mine. Beanie Babies have never been a passion of mine, but knowing how much time and research - and money, omg - my grandmother invested into these, I felt I had to do my homework and figure out what I had on my hands here. It took a long time, but I catalogued, photographed, and re-binned each and every one of them and checked price guides and eBay sales to note general price ranges...I know that those aren’t always reliable but it gave me a general sense of what was rare vs common. After cataloguing, I’d say this collection is about 75% standard-issue beans (which I’ll split up into bulk sales and donations) and 20-25% mid-to-high value beans, including a number of authenticated rarities. I’m starting the long, slow process of selling these little bean-dudes (who I have to say, I’ve grown some affection for), but I haven’t gotten past the point of picking out an eBay account name (I went with There Will Be Beans, but BeanRunner2049 was really close). Actually creating all of the listings and managing shipments and everything seems completely overwhelming to me. Also, most of these are being stored at my parents’ place in Florida. I shipped a few hundred of them back to my apartment in California so I could start the process, but even moving through selling this first batch feels like a huge undertaking. We’ll see how it goes! Any recommendations or advice would be appreciated, but mostly I just felt like I needed to share this saga with some folks who might",

These damages were very clearly not there in the seller’s photos, but were present when it was delivered to me. This is a one-of-a-kind card, so there is no possible dubious swapping going on. Ebay has suggested essentially that I relist and sell the card in an auction on the site, and that they would reimburse me for the differences in what I paid and the proceeds from the sale. They will not allow me to just return the card. Has anyone else ever experienced this? It just seems odd to me, and I question whether I can trust eBay to follow through with their side of this. How they’ve treated this so far, I don’t feel confident in their processes. EDIT: upon re-reading their recent message, they’re actually only offering to reimburse me for the fees to resell it. Which is definitely a lose-lose situation for me.",

    "text": "Three AGS-101s: Repaired In order of difficulty: - The green/blue reshell (right) I just slapped together from spare parts. The motherboard booted games with sound, but would not charge, and both triggers did not function. Turns out it was a failed IPS/mod victim; (pad Q12b had evidence of a wire), and there was a *massive* fail in someone trying to replace the R/L triggers- They ripped the L traces clean off, and lifted/shorted out some legs on the SRAM (!) trying to remove R trigger, so I had to fix all that. The non-charging ended up being F1 blown, which I replaced. I used a spare brand new repro Chinese 101 screen I picked up a few years back from a batch with stuck pixels- and the stuck pixel disappeared after a few minutes of play so it paid off. The repro shell was supposed to be Surf Blue, but it sort of isn’t and feels a bit crappy- oh well. I’ll probably find an OEM one later. - The Starlight Gold (left) is AUS/SE Asia: It arrived booting games, however no sound, no charging, and non-functional R trigger. Turns out it had terrible moisture damage all across the ports and top of the board, and the R trigger was basically fused to the traces. Once I cleaned/repaired the ports and triggers, it charged successfully and sound emerged but almost inaudible- A recap fixed that. The original screen looks perfect, no ‘halo’ at all. The shell I thought I’d have to throw away, since most of the screws were totally rusted down- some are still stuck in it, but I at least got the shell off without breaking it. It’s a rare-ish color so I’m keeping it that way (and am annoyed at the non-matching silver battery cover, have already found and ordered a correct Starlight one). I’m satisfied how the AUS stickers list a production year (2007- my second favorite year). - The Pink Pearl system is another one I basically assembled from spare parts. I bought the motherboard maybe ten years ago for like $15 , to fix my first AGS-001 ; me ten years ago didn’t bother to check to confi",

[[Explore Top Rated larry walker rookie card on Amazon.]](https://blogs.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=larry walker rookie card) ## Key Features Analysis The larry walker rookie cards are available across several different brands and sets from the late 1980s,each with its own unique characteristics and collectibility. **1989 Donruss #33** The 1989 donruss card features a classic design of the era,with walker pictured in his montreal expos uniform. The card quality is typical of donruss from that period, which means there can be centering issues or soft corners sometimes. The card itself is relatively abundant, making it more affordable for many collectors. **1989 Fleer #548** The 1989 fleer card showcases walker in a batting stance. The fleer sets of the late 80s are known for their occasionally poor quality control, especially with print defects.This particular card, while common, can fetch a premium if it's well-centered and free from any markings or damage. **1989 Score #404** The 1989 score card presents walker in an action shot fielding a ball.

Figured I either get a good deal, or worst case get my money back. I buy the item. Tracking provided. All good. Except for tracking it said 2 items were in transit. That raised an alarm as only one item was bought. Anyways item finally “arrives, except it didn’t. I live in a house, and tracking says delivered at front desk. I knew right then and there it was too good to be true. I contact eBay for a refund. They deny it. I appeal it, they deny it again saying seller provided proper documentation... Finally I call eBay and get a hold of an awesome lady who said she has seen this more and more and sellers price stuff under $750, because no signature or picture is required for drop off. I then had to sign a declaration stating I never got this and lying could result in perjury charges... but I finally got my money back. What a nightmare though.",

I feel like I’m over paying for these cards. I was doing the same thing with Pokémon cards ( paying $1/per card—lowest amount you can charge on Mercari ) for cards I later found out were worth .05 . I started learning the prices and would let the mercari sellers know and make them sell me it in bulk with the right pricing. But then I just started buying from TCG directly becus it was easier than having mto haggle with the ppl on Mercari and shipping was usually free after spending $5. I was wondering if there is a sports card site similar to this where they sell cards for diff prices depending on quality as well as way better prices that actually correlate with the market value and not just same made up amount like on eBay and Mercari.",

    "text": "Buying ungraded cards on ebay from Japan - delivery directly to vault/grading? Hi! I don't really understand the full grading/vault process if you are buying ungraded cards. Can I simply ship ungraded cards to the vault and they get graded? Can I even buy ungraded cards on ebay and have them delivered to PSA for grading/vaulting directly? Does PSA vault ungraded cards or is grading always necessary? Obviously apart from the fact that the tariffs probably make this impossible right now - in a normal world, what would be the procedure/options here? Thanks!",

What do you guys use as effective and concise storage that keeps large amounts of product safe and easy to access? 2. Shipping. What do you guys use to ship larger orders? Bubble mailers or just PWE? Are there any particular products you guys use that are good for sending multiple cards at once? Right now, with my larger orders being only 3 cards, I just send in PWE with a top loader. Also, do you guys tend to use stamps or do you go into the post office and pay for shipping there? 3. Pricing. How do you guys to price the cards and shipping?

Hype is high, but hard numbers are scarce. This launch is GameStop’s most substantial action in driving revenue growth, taking the company from stabilizing operations to growth focused. The goal of this post is to quantify the potential revenue if the feature scales, lay out every assumption in plain sight, and call out both the upside (PSA partnership, 6 % fee edge) and the obstacles (inventory, eBay’s dominance). **Key facts that anchor the model** |Fact|Why it matters| |:-|:-| |**5.6 M** paying PowerUp Rewards Pro members (56.7 M total)|Built‐in early‐adopter pool| |**600 k+** sports‐card transactions *per week* on eBay (≈31 M/yr)|The market share GME can nibble away at| |**$245 M** of June‐’25 hobby spend flowed through eBay (80 % share)|eBay’s fee load (\\~13 %) is Power Packs’ wedge| |**$211 M** collectibles revenue in GME Q1 FY25 (+55 % YoY)|Cards are already a core pillar—Power Packs just digitises it| |**$33 B** global trading‐card market, growing **22 % CAGR**|Plenty of runway| *(Sources: Shacknews, Chasing Majors, CLLCT, PR Newswire)* **Assumptions you can tweak** * Average selling price (ASP) per pack = $37 * Pack mix = 80% $25 | 15% $50 | 4% $100 | 1% $500 * Instant flip‐rate = 70% of packs * Instant‐sale fee = 6% of 90% cash offer = 5.4% of ASP * Shipping fee (when collectors withdraw) = $5 on 20% of kept slabs * Buyers per month & packs per buyer = see scenarios below **Twelve‐month run‐rate scenarios** *\\*Note: These numbers will take time to reach and the total revenue is for the full year.

I have been selling some of my things on my Ebay account to assist me with my bills recently. However, this morning Ebay put my payouts on hold while my account has a 'periodic review'. I spoke with Ebay customer service today and they told me that this review started because I had a noticeable increase in the amount I have sold lately & that it was a standard review. Ebay customer service said it would take likely 5 business days at minimum to finish this review and have my account hold lifted so that I can receive my funds. Since I am in need of these funds now to pay my bills, I am hoping that someone would be willing to loan me the money needed for my bills, and then I could repay them after my account hold is lifted. I am requesting two weeks to pay back the funds as I need to wait at least 5 days for my funds to be released from my Ebay hold and then I will need to have the funds transferred from Ebay to my bank account, which can take another 3-5 days. (Two weeks allows me the time needed plus a few ",

    "text": "Let's take a look at Courtyard and what this tells us about the future of Power Packs for our stonk... Just been digging into Courtyard as a useful comparison with GameStop's new Power Packs/PSA launch. So by way of background, Courtyard (\\[dot\\] io - not sure if I can post a link to it here) is an existing collectibles platform which has been around for from what I can tell just over 7 months. Auctioning a [quarter of a million dollar Charizard](https://www.cryptotimes.io/2024/12/06/rare-250k-charizard-pokemon-card-going-on-auction-this-friday/) on their platform seems to have been their first big go at publicity from what I can tell and only this week they raised $30 million in a Series A funding round. Here's what they have to say about themselves on a job ad: >Courtyard is the fastest-growing collectibles startup, ever. We are revolutionizing the world of collectibles trading by enabling instant liquidity and delivering a high-velocity, immersive experience. From trading cards to comics, we’re redefining how people discover, collect, and unlock value. >Courtyard is not just another marketplace. All assets are securely vaulted and fully insured, giving collectors peace of mind alongside unmatched speed and simplicity. Whether you’re investing, discovering, or curating your dream collection, we’ve built a platform that’s trusted, simple, and built for speed. >And we’re just getting started. We’re a remote-first company hiring across all functions to push the boundaries of what’s possible in collectibles and digital ownership. Anyway, so like our new platform, they let their customers buy, sell, and trade physical trading cards, comics etc. through their online platform. And it’s growing fast. This year, transaction volume hit 95,000 per day, and in February alone they reported $42.6 million in sales volume. They’ve reported $9 million in revenue and raised $37.1 million total in funding, including the $30 million Series A round previously mentioned. Their model is",

I want to preface this by saying im originally from crypto and over the last few months ive been rolling some profits into TCGs, but more specifically one piece, my strategy has been thus far half sealed product and half grails, now that i have probably finished accumulating, im going to share some rambling thoughts that i have. regarding sealed product ive been dabbling in only the strongest sets, romance dawn, blue and white bottom for obvious reasons being the first set, op05, op09 and prb01, bought a few cases of op11 aswell because its cheap and also has very good cards although i think this ones a slow cook because of how new it is AND bandai have definitely started printing more product then the earlier sets. Since prb02 dropped in japan and we found out there's probably no manga god packs, i even bought more prb01 as i feel it seems pretty obvious to me that lack of manga god packs will make prb01 even more highly sought after. regarding the grails, ive taken the same approach, mostly buying up the high value cards, being op01 manga shanks and some pre errata alt leaders, again first manga ever, card itself is not the best but it has provenance and that is important imo, gear 5 luffy from op05 but also the prb01 version, the oda sig luffy also from op05, this one has insane low available supply online despite a decent population count and very hard to get in english, tcg player prices for oda sig luffy are totally wrong simply because no one is actually selling them so old pricing cant be updated yet, ppl arent stupid and are obviously holding on to this card (everything im talking about is obviously english only, and i only buy graded (i dont dabble in jpy product, too much supply) regarding reprint mangas, for the most part i dont buy them, i stick with originals, however i do make an exception for g5 luffy prb01 reprint because its just such a good/popular card. Now we get to the card i think is the MOST mispriced, gold gol.d.rog",

I'm usually not much into speculation based off a video of a bunny but what the hell here we go: Alright, so looks to me like GameStop is going to have people trading in their PSA vaulted cards “Digitally” for a id imagine store credit towards a game on their website or potentially a cash payout through PayPal on Ebay then it’s a great way for GameStop to get more inventory to then sell back to the consumer at higher prices through their EBay store. If it’s the other way around flippers and scalpers will be playing Astro blasters and Snake to “win” a graded Togepi while camping out for the next Pokemon Set release. This creates an ecosystem and GameStop sells ad space to card companies who need exposure to like minded collectors. I will say it’s a decent expansion of the ability to take in graded cards. I imagine there is no “cash” option with the trade in digitally. Unless it’s through PayPal on their consignment service. Whether it moves the needle on revenue...we’ll see. Especially if they’re paying EBay fees. Their drawback to in person is there are only a few participating stores where you can sell your graded cards. Doing it digitally opens up WAY more volume to the people that don’t have a certified store that takes submissions. The National Card show in Chicago starts on Wednesday-Sunday. I imagine if there’s any big announcement from GameStop it happens during the show. Edit 1: For anyone that thinks Gamestops push into digital re-packs with Push Start Arcade is groundbreaking. I got news for you: Courtyard IO and Arena Club have already been doing this and it's somewhat profitable (millions) a year. Sure, Gamestop can scale the business. Arena Club's annual revenue: Estimated annual revenue of $5.6 million. Annual revenue reached $15 million as of July 2025. Revenue range of $10 million to $50 million. Revenue of $20 million.

    "text": "Sealed Collecting: Is it dead? This is my personal story of the last 5 years of sealed collecting, investing, and selling. Part 1: Going in hard, and getting in way way to deep. 5 years ago it was the summer of 2020 and I was on vacation sitting in a pool somewhere in Georgia and youtube fed me a video. I had returned to MTG in 2018 with Dominaria and I was still in full excitement mode seeing some of my old cards from the 90s had appreciated in value. The supply chain FOMO of 2020 and 2021 was just setting in when a video on Youtube got me psyched about building a cardboard empire. The guy was wearing a green visor, standing in front of a wipe board and talking about box prices going to the moon. I had done pretty well in the 90s buying sealed boxes of ice age, alliances and mirage cracking packs and selling singles to pay for the hobby. It seemed like sealed was the way to go. My optimistic and incredibly naïve plan: Buy a case of each set, wait the 5 years for it to double, sell half the case and have a free sealed collection. My goal was to spend about $2K per year on draft plus some extraneous stuff like commander decks and bundles, then after 5 years have about $10,000 invested worth $20,000. At the 2x mark I wanted to start selling to achieve a $10,000 set of sealed products for free. 5 years later did it work? Well sort of... Here are some things that have changed: · Specialty sets that cost 2x-3.5x a normal set (I’m looking at you commander masters) · Regular sets skyrocketing in price 50% from $80 to $130 a box · The pace of sets – No more 3x 1 case per year. · The amount of different product lines – collector, set, draft, play, commander decks etc · Universes beyond Needless to say, the idea of just spreading a little bit of money out and waiting became almost infinitely harder. MTG added set and collector boosters? Unsure of which to buy, I bought a case of each. Double masters came out and VIP boxes were $80-90, with draft at $300. I bought some cases o",

    "text": "Very important rule for EBay buying If you purchase a bag that is final sale but authenticity guaranteed, do not assume the money back guarantee will cover you. For example, my bag had damage that I was not contacted about. When I tried to get a return, they said no because the authenticity guarantee finalizes the final sale. When I questioned their mistake, they said their team doesn’t make mistakes and said my pictures were too blurry to tell if there was damage. The pictures weren’t blurry and you could clearly see damage. I filed a chargeback and they told my credit card company they were willing to take it back, but I wouldn’t return it. I have 3 messages from reps saying no I couldn’t return it. So here I sit in limbo land hoping I didn’t get scammed out of $700 from EBay. From EBay “What buyers need to know about returns Some purchases inspected under Authenticity Guarantee are considered final sale. eBay Money Back Guarantee does not cover final sale purchases on the basis that the item doesn't match the listing. Returns for final sale purchases are only eligible for coverage under eBay Money Back Guarantee when: The item was damaged during shipping, or The seller doesn't honor their stated returns policy”",

Here’s how to sell smartly: Step 1: Pick Your Platform For speed: Try CardSell (app) or eBay (auction-style, but fees eat profits). For max value: Negotiate P2P (OfferUp, Craigslist). Insist on secure payment (Zelle/Venmo only after verification). Safe trade: Reddit’s r/giftcardexchange or r/GCTrading(Always check the trust and scam lists) Step 2: Price It Right Physical cards fetch 5-10% more than e-codes. Bulk discounts? GiftCardBin buys large quantities (e.g., corporate leftovers). Step 3: Safety Checks Never share PINs before payment. Use escrow services (like Bisq for crypto-minded folks).

ATM I am trying to get back into the game with sports cards starting with Panima NBA cards with Prizm and Totally Certified right now and considering using eBay right now. This is my plan: 1. Try to get Hobby boxes sometimes retail packs or boxes every month, not like real expensive.. no more than and less than $200 a month. 2. Trying to buy hobbys or retails without getting whole bunch of extra junk cards. Junk cards I consider are ones that has no real value and just takes up space. 3. Get good ones that I see that has been selling for good prices get PSA graded. 4. Known names that has been playing that sells well in the market with same cards like ones I have now LeBron James, Kevin Durant get them graded, go long term invest.e t then prob sell those in 20 years or after they retire and go to HOF. 5. Keep 2024-25 rookies I have now for long term investment growth in case they stand out within next 5 years., get em PSA graded if their stats meets my standards like All-Star appearances, awards, etc.. 6. Right now try to eBay sell the cards I don't want to keep(like my junk cards), may have to throw in deals like buy one get one free deals, sleeves, cases,, etc.. -This will also be a good way to for me to setup an eBay store, maybe one day turn it into a real LLC online business, who knows.",

Sometimes it’s flagged for review sometimes it just takes longer than usual for no clear reason. I made a couple changes to try and smooth it out. One thing that seemed to help was switching to a US based account fron Adro banking that can receive ACH and wires directly. Since doing that I think things have felt a bit more stable and I think it’s made my seller profile look a bit more established to the platform. I also started reviewing my return policy and shipping settings to see if anything there might be triggering hold ups especially for new buyers. Cleaned up some of my product listings too just made them a bit more US market friendly with clearer shipping times and localized pricing. Still figuring it all out though.

You walk in, insert your Pokémon, MTG, or sports card into a secure machine, and within minutes it’s scanned, graded by AI, slabbed in store, and added to your GameStop wallet on the blockchain!

Think about what that unlocks: * Instant grading using high-res imaging and machine learning to assess centering, corners, edges, and surface * Secure encapsulation (slabbed right in front of you) * Real-time blockchain registration - card is in your account and verified on-chain * You could trade, sell, or vault it the same day through GameStop's marketplace or wallet This solves multiple pain points in the collectibles space: 1. Grading delays and shipping risk 2. Trust and transparency in card condition 3. Difficulty onboarding casual collectors into the ecosystem It’s also a massive opportunity for GameStop: * Increased physical foot traffic from a new customer segment * Recurring kiosk revenue (grading fees, encapsulation, etc.) * Onboarding costumers into their Web3 wallet ecosystem through a real, tangible asset not speculative JPEGs * Tying all of this into a collectible trading platform would instantly set them apart from eBay and Whatnot No, they aren’t doing this yet. But the pieces are there: * GameStop already partnered with PSA * They’ve built blockchain rails and a wallet which they could easily bring back * They’re sitting on thousands of stores that could house these kiosks * And the collectibles market is still red hot, especially among younger collectors People are still sleeping on how big the trading card market is, and how broken the grading experience still is in 2025.

I did. The seller, in the original listing, wrote: \"Houndoom H11/H32 Aquapolis Holo **in near perfect condition**. Kept in binder with minimal light exposure, minor curling due to age... **Card has almost no signs of wear**, only things a grader would look for. Definitely a great collector's item, looking to get rid of quickly.\" Evidently, his statements weren't true. Thankfully eBay intercepted this for me. Attached photos from communication by eBay (email/app), and eBay listing shots Just thought I'd share. Kind of feel a bit better buying a card this way, than from a less protected medium like OfferUp or Mercari.

It should be 1.99 x 13.25% = 25 CENTS FOR THEM IF ANYTHING not the fucking shipping label AND the item itself combined to take A WHOLE DOLLAR WHILE I GET CENTS!!! 0.87$ is what i made when realistically it SHOULD HAVE BEEN 1.25 or A FUCKING DOLLAR AMOUNT!!😀😀😀 im about to switch over to actual comic book websites cause atleast (i think) their honest about the fees they’ll charge and take. Don’t give me the “ohhh its ebay thats just how they make their” THEY MAKE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO JUST TAKE THE DAMN QUARTER ANS GIVE THE SELLER THE DOLLAR THAT HE IS RIGHTFULLY OWED!!!!

I fully support every individuals right to list items as they please: price, condition, whatever. Do as you will. I am not upset or disgruntled in the slightest, I just have observed a trend ( this trend has gone on for years). When a given item is listed at a bloated price and a customer decides he will pay that bloated price for the item all sellers of that particular item jump on the bandwagon and mark up prices. It doesn't matter if the item is easy to find and plenty on the market. I was at a local used book store and purchased a copy of The Complete Druids Handbook in excellent condition. I paid 30 USD when taxes were factored in. I looked on eBay to see what the rate was and I wasn't surprised to see countless seller listing this book at 60 + in most cases. Many books to be had, not a rarity at all. The eBay market is a quite a ride. I suppose people just want to get paid. This is one of my shipping inserts for clarification on cost of shipping. The buyer picks up the fee but eBay does have it's seller fees to contend with. https://preview.redd.it/l4e79z7wyocf1.jpg?width=770&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a0b0a12908950c9bd9b01383357c6a87442dd4be",

    "text": "Dear camera sellers: used means it *works* I can’t take it any more. Dear eBay camera sellers: If you’re selling a film camera on eBay and you don’t know whether it works, *please* stop listing it as “Used” with “READ” in the title. If you list it as “Used,” that means it works. Not “it looks ornamental”, not “it might be but it’s your problem now,” it means it *works*. That’s not an opinion. That’s eBay policy. It doesn’t matter if you buried a disclaimer about how you found it at an estate sale and it looks fine, or you didn’t have film so you couldn’t test it and therefore its buyer beware, if you chose used, you chose to categorize your listing with other *working* cameras. If the shutter doesn’t fire, the meter is dead and affects the exposure, the film advance doesn’t move, or you just didn’t test it because you don’t have film, if I get it and it doesn’t work, that’s not a working camera. That’s a parts camera. Which means. I’ll be shipping it right back as Item Not As Described, because there’s a category for nonfunctional items. It’s called “For parts or not working.” That’s the one you should be using. It doesn’t matter what you write in your disclaimer. It doesn’t matter that you put “READ” in your description. The condition you chose overrides it. You can’t select “Used” and bury “I’m not sure” halfway down the listing. If you don’t want to represent that the camera works, there’s a simple solution: *don’t*. So please. If you don’t know if it works, and you don’t want the item back as INAD, use the “For parts or not working” option. Stop dusting your listings with hopium, and let me filter you out if I don’t want to waste my time and energy on your “it might work” listing. Rant over. On behalf of tired photographers everywhere who just want to use the filters on eBay. ETA: I know there are folks on here who for some reason assume that because these are film cameras that they are vintage listings. They are *not* vintage listings: if they were, they wouldn",

    "text": "PSA Vault Review Pros and Cons !! Hello everyone, I know there was a post a couple months back on getting started using the vault, but I wanted to give my in depth review along with some big pros and cons that you may not be aware of if you arent an active user. I have most of my collection stored there and have been using it pretty much since it started up. Hope this helps some people. The Good: * One of their biggest selling points on the vault is being tax free, since it is located in DE. If you withdrawal early you will still have to pay a fee, but it is negligble compared to the taxes you would pay on high end cards. After 90 days of being vaulted you don't pay this fee. * You can receive cash offers from within their PSA network. Zero fees with immediate payment. The offers can range from laughable lowballs, but occassionaly you might get a really strong one at 90-100% market. For reference I have only accepted two offers this way. From what I understand the \"network\" is mostly businesses trying to obtain inventory, I am guessing they have to pay some sort of subscription/prove they are an actual business to join, but Idk. If someone here is part of it and has more insight would love to know. * You can change listings in real time. This market is changing faster than ever and extremely volatile. If you have sent a consignment with BIN pricing other places, that same price may not hold up by the time it is listed, not an issue with the vault. * You can ship directly from your vault to a private buyer. * For older Certs they will give you the high res scan if one dosent already exist. * Liability is not on you anymore. I know many of yall have sweated watching the tracking of something sent out, Ik I have. * They also provide really convenient data with recent solds, may not always be 100% up to date or accurate approximations of value, but can be helpful as a starting point in figuring out how to price. * The fees are cheaper than selling a card by yourself on ",

    "text": "Your State’s Consumer Protection Laws and Windows 11 Key Refunds # Understanding Your Refund and Replacement Rights for Windows 11 Keys: A State-by-State Guide Purchasing a Windows 11 key online or in-store should be simple. But what happens when the key doesn’t work? Whether the code is invalid, already used, or fails to activate your system, your right to a refund or replacement can vary depending on the laws of your state. This guide breaks down the key consumer protection laws that impact how Windows 11 key disputes are handled—and what you can do if you’re sold a faulty license. --- ## 1. Not All States Offer the Same Protection Each U.S. state has its own consumer protection statutes. While most align with the **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)**, some go further by enforcing **stronger refund or warranty rights**. * **California**: Leads in consumer protection with the **Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act**, which requires all retail products—including software—to carry an implied warranty that they will work as expected. * **New York**: Applies general business law that includes protections for digital goods, with clear mandates for issuing refunds if an item is defective or not delivered. * **Florida, Texas, Illinois**: Follow UCC provisions but require buyers to notify the seller promptly and provide proof of defect before claiming a remedy. * **Delaware and Wyoming**: Offer minimal consumer protection and rely primarily on seller policies or federal law. --- ## 2. What Counts as a Faulty Windows 11 Key? Here are some common activation issues that may qualify as a defect under consumer law: * The key has **already been used** or activated by someone else. * The product is **not as advertised** (e.g., OEM key sold as Retail). * The code is **incompatible** with the user’s hardware or region. * The seller refuses to support or replace the key after failure. In most states, such issues can entitle you to a full refund or a replacement product—**but only if you a",

    "text": "First time sending comic for grading. Im going to get a comic signed at a local horror convention. No CGC representative will be there so i know i wont qualify for a signature series book but i still plan to apply for a CGC/JSA authentication. I have a dew questions regarding this as i have never sent a comic out to be graded before. What kind of provenance do i need if any? Pictures of the signing proof etc. i know JSA will do their thing anyway. Is it best to ship it myself or find a local comic shop to see if they will ship it for a commission fee or whatever since they probably have a good way of packaging things off safely. The Comic im regarding here is a limited series and comes with a Certificate of Authenticity, can they put it behind the comic in the capsule so it wont be separated if i made a note of it somewhere or should i just display it in a frame together? Any other suggestions/tips for going about this would be appreciated!!",

She also has a bunch of the shadowless (second printing I think) I’m not super experienced with grading, but I’ve been looking through others posts here and been thinking about possibly sending some in to be graded with the intent of selling them to get my mom some extra money. I’d love your help figuring out which ones might be worth actually sending in and what grading company is best for these cards. I see so many opinions on CGC vs PSA and I've been trying to look up sold comps on ebay but tbh its all very confusing to me. I’ve attached some photos so you can see some of the cards. Most have been stored in sleeves or binders, but are in really good condition considering how old they are. If anyone can give advice on which ones are worth grading for value vs selling as is, that would be amazing. I appreciate any advice to get the ball rolling on this. Thanks so much!",

I now realize that there are two keys to realizing that this is a fake. First, this fake label pretends to be generation 8 label, but the real generation 8 label doesn’t have this PSA logo on the top of the label. This PSA logo is bolder than the real one, and I suspect a scammer made it according to generation 9 label(the PSA logo of generation 9 is bolder than the one from generation 8). Second, generation 8 label doesn’t have this type of holder. As far as I know, PSA began to use this type of holder with generation 10 label. But the holder itself doesn’t look fake. So I think the scammer reused the real holder to make this. As I said above, it took me a lot of knowledge and time to realize this was a fake, so I post it to share with other collectors and want to help them avoid fakes. Thanks for reading.",

I am sure all reading this are aware that TCGplayer is very problematic in 2025 and you have a high chance of getting screwed nowadays. Just happened to me too, I ordered a display of 1st edition Yugioh decks and received 2 loose decks instead of 10 shrinkwrapped, a roughly $700 delta between what I paid for and what I received. I am not sure why everyone seems to think this is the place to complain when your TCGplayer purchase goes wrong? Why not the tcgplayer subs or the main magic sub? This sub was much more useful and interesting when it was discussing card and sealed specs, online sales/shipping discussion and strategy, card investments and portfolios, ya know mtg finance stuff. Nowadays its reading like a TCGplayer complaints box and I don’t think it’s very constructive for us to be naming and shaming unscrupulous sellers one at a time, which will achieve approximately nothing, when really the whole platform should be boycotted so they adopt better policies and protections for both sides. Not to mention their seller interface is still basically 90s internet, which is why I haven’t sold there for years. Anyway I love you all fellow mages just want to see the quality of this sub back to what it was, and to stop seeing yall get ripped off, so lets take our business to another platform! Thanks for reading EDIT: I forgot to mention in the original post that the actual data on problematic sellers can be useful if properly organized into a sheet, I made that sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-ETZRIbg7_68_W44ozD7MromwudIRucRPpUCwtpOXXI/edit?usp=drivesdk).

    "text": "How I failed my first 3 months in eBay dropshipping (and then turned it around) When I started eBay dropshipping, I wasted a good 3 months doing it completely wrong. I was trying to find the perfect products, spending way too much time researching items, analyzing competition, trying to reverse engineer what other sellers were doing. I maybe had like 50 listings up and I was getting like 1 sale every 3 weeks. Looking back, I realize I was just overcomplicating everything. The turning point for me was when I stopped looking for “winning items” and just focused on volume. Instead of guessing what would sell, I started listing as many items as possible every single day. I use Amazon as my supplier and list the same products on eBay with about a 100 to 105 percent markup. Once I shifted into that mindset, things started to move fast. I went from barely any sales to getting multiple sales per day. And now I’ve got over 10,000 active listings and I’m consistently doing between $1,000 and $3,000 in profit each month. No ads, no complicated setup. Just raw volume. Most people underestimate how powerful that impulse buyer behavior is on eBay. People just scroll, see something they like, and buy it. They’re not checking if it’s cheaper on Amazon or thinking too hard. They just hit buy now. So if you have enough listings live, you’ll naturally catch those eyeballs. I usually list about 100 new items per day. It sounds like a lot but once you get into a rhythm it becomes second nature. I also optimize titles so the listings show up in search, but I keep it super simple. The main mistake I see people make is thinking you need to be clever or find secret products. You don’t. You just need to play the numbers game. That’s what finally worked for me.",

    "text": "UPDATE/PT. 2: Optic Downtown MHJ Automatic PSA Grade thru EBay is complete. Took 12 days (!) total What a roller coaster ride. I DO NOT recommend doing this at all. Probably no surprise to you all, but the difference between the quality in the EBay listing photos & the photo PSA took before grading was pretty significant. I started to worry I would get a bad grade so I’m taking my 9 and running. The silver lining is, albeit for one card, this was fast as hell. 12 days from purchase to completed grading - I imagine the EBay pipeline helped with that. A couple people commented their turnaround time was lighting when they used this, too. PURCHASE MADE: June 8th REACHED PSA: June 16th GRADED & FINALIZED: June 20th Drop any questions I’ll try to answer them here. Likely not selling this card btw, I’m sure there’s better priced PSA 9s than what I’d part with it for after this emotional ordeal.",

I have used Royal Mail for the past 5 years for every sale in my busisness, have sent well over 3000 large letters/parcels in the UK and sent around 200 units abroad to 20-30 different countrys. Never had one item not arrive, had the odd delay here and there but apart from that, not one problem. i'm a Royal Mail loyalist because of the perfect delivery rate. Recently switched to 'Tracked 48' for every sale due to Ebays new policys around payouts, and sent this parcel at my usual branch on Tuesday 10th June around 7.30am. However, since that day there has been absolute no movement and is stuck on 'sender despatching item'. Every time i read about this, most people blame the seller \"oh that means they have just bought a label but not posted it\". But i did post it and have a proof of receipt. So where can i go from here? Can any RM employee give me an insight into what might have happened here? And do i have any hope it will be updated/resolved? Many thanks",

    "text": "What to do with the last of my dad’s collection? Hi everyone, I apologize if this post goes against the rules at all (tried to educate myself but I unfortunately am not a baseball collector, so most of the terms are hard for me to understand lol). I am feeling overwhelmed and uncertain of what to do with the last of my dad’s baseball card collection. He was born in 1940 so he collected most of these when he was a kid. He had a pretty sizable collection, most of which I gave to an auction house to sell off a few years ago, but we held onto these. I assume he originally pulled them and kept them ever since, but unfortunately he passed away in 2020 and is no longer around to ask. I am experiencing a lot of financial stress and absolutely do not have the funds to pay upfront for grading (I think I saw it was about $400 to grade a card worth $10k or more through PSA). I have also noticed the values fluctuate immensely depend on the grade the card receives. I want to maximize the proceeds I get from these as it would help immensely with my debt, and I wouldn’t want them to sell for far less than they are truly worth. I understand selling on something like eBay or through an auction house would take a significant portion of the funds, but if that’s still the best route for me, I could do that. Please, if anyone could advise on what I should do, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much :)",

It’s the clearest truth we’ve seen since the first DRS form was filed. GameStop is no longer a retailer. It’s the seed of something bigger: A decentralized Berkshire Hathaway for the digital age. One born from meme power, forged in financial fire, and sharpened by thousands of minds aligned on Superstonk. I. The Backstory: Timeline of Seeds 2019–2020: GameStop is dying. Short interest exceeds float. Enter Ryan Cohen (chewy co-founder) and Keith Gill (aka DFV). Retail begins accumulating and noticing abnormalities. 2021: GME squeeze explodes. Robinhood halts trades. DTCC exposed. DRS movement begins. Superstonk is born. Keith Gill becomes a folk hero for modern investing. 2022: RC makes a surprise move: invests in Babies. Offers to buy for $400M. Publicly says “Buy Baby is the real value.” DeepEffingValkyrie and RC both had animal with four legs stock history. Their vision overlaps. GameStop tests \"WhoopRing\" (have to change everything due to anal rules from this community MODS) (zkRollup-powered NFT wallet). Timing coincides with NFT boom... and bust. 2023: GameStop confirms 4,100 PitGoins on balance sheet. Silent but strategic. WhoopRing disappears from chatter. Rumors say “something bigger is being built.” Towels goes bankrupt. Overstonk buys Bye Bobbie branding. RC’s creditor status remains unclear. Possible bond or rights holder? 2024–2025: Ghost signals emerge: conditional BB Bobby orders cancelled. u/advocado and other coded accounts reappear post-RC tweets. Knicks game appearance. Ryan Cohen seated with MSG owners? GME returns to headlines. Volume spikes. PitGoin rises. II. The Thesis: What Is GameStop Now? GameStop is not a store.

    "text": "Anyone else struggling with reconciliation between eBay payouts and supplier transactions? Hi everyone, I recently started an eBay dropshipping store and quickly realized how painful the reconciliation process is. eBay gives me payouts, and I need to match them with every single supplier transaction. But the supplier side often has delays or missing entries, and manual reconciliation is super time-consuming and error-prone. To save time, I built an automated system that parses and analyzes both sides and flags discrepancies or missing data. It’s made my life a lot easier. Here is the screenshot: [EBay payout screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/qtX4Q7D) I'm curious: * Are you facing the same problem? * Would you consider paying a monthly subscription for a tool that automates this process? * What features would be a must-have for you? Would really appreciate your input — trying to understand if this is a broader pain point in the dropshipping community.",

    "text": "So I had this interesting situation come up on TCGPlayer recently. I ordered 3 QCSR Emergency Teleport from a seller in April for around $11 each. The expected arrival date came without receiving them, so I messaged seller asking if they had a tracking number (as they should for an order above $30 IMO.) They said they didn’t but offered right off to send me 3 new copies if I still wanted them. I did, so I said that would be fine. Since they offered this right off, I suspected they forgot to send the cards—but whatever. A couple weeks later, still no cards and still no tracking so I opened a case with TCGPlayer before it got too far past the order date where I was able to do so. But I messaged the seller and told them that if the cards ended up still showing up, I would reverse the refund (because I try to be an honest guy). Seller doesn’t respond so I go ahead and just buy another Playset from someone else. Now today (9 days after I opened the case) the cards do arrive—but I see they weren’t post-marked until 2 days AFTER I messaged the seller telling them I would reverse the refund if the cards still arrived. So clearly they finally only sent the cards after I opened the case—so they could force a sale—after they failed to send the cards either of the previous two times they were supposed to. I obviously don’t need the cards anymore. I said I’d reverse the refund—but now I’m just extremely frustrated with how the seller handled this, both by never using a tracking number and by only sending the cards after I opened a case and didn’t need the cards anymore. Would you go ahead and reverse the refund? Would you send the cards back? Negative feedback? Neutral feedback? Some other option? I don’t want my own irritation keep me from being reasonable here.",

My apologies if this situation is common for most of you. The seller in question is small. Only 15 items sold and 6 current listings. Among them are a few comics valued between $40-80 each. I won at auction the most valuable of these comics for under $30. Seller then cancelled and refunded payment due to “missing or damaged item.” They then preceded to re-list for auction that same comic, but this time with a starting price double what I just paid. They didn’t even wait a few days! They put the book I won back up for auction immediately after claiming they’d lost it and couldn’t honor my win. I’m so sick of stuff like this. I’d never think of treating my buyers like this. I’ve only been buying and selling for a few months now, and this is the third time something like this happened. I reported it this time cause it was so brazen and insulting. Does anyone know if eBay takes these complaints seriously? It’s upsetting that I can’t leave feedback on this exchange. Seller only has a 89% rating with only 15 sales though. So I’m not the first person they’ve screwed with. Sorry. Rant over. That item has been on my list for years now. I was excited. Now I’ve got emotional whiplash and I’m trying to avoid going to bed angry. Thank you to anyone who read this far. I hope you’re getting a better site experience than I have lately. EDIT: Whoa. This blew up a bit. So sorry I haven’t responded to you all. I’ve been on the road for work and didn’t think this would generate so much discussion. I’m grateful to everyone here, and I did manage to find a way to leave feedback eventually. Took me till 3am to figure out how, but I was motivated. And I’ll definitely be checking out seller reviews more thoroughly in the future. Thank you everyone.",

    "text": "(Soft Guide/ Discussion) Making repros work for you! Before we get any of the standard \"but...\" comments, this is for a specific set of people, if your not one of them, thats great I still hope you learn something. What You Will Need: 1. GB/GBC Pokemon Repro Cart (Haven't worked with gen 3 yet) The one your looking for usually has a 2017 on the back of the board (seen easiest on crystal) You'll know you have one if the game freezes and the music stops for more then 5 seconds when trying to save. 2. Soldering Iron and the skill to use it (Seriously burns suck) 3. Gameboy Cart Flasher (Tested this method with the GBX and \"Flash Boy\") 4. CR2025/CR1616 Batteries (Tabbed) (Tape and wire if you are working on gen 2, as the 2025 batteries are larger than the board tabs) 5. Rom of the game (Obtained however). What We're Doing: We are trying to remove as much \"jank\" from these as possible to make them more playable and accessible to anyone who either doesn't want to sell a kidney, wants to get a copy of green working, or just wants more copies to trade/hunt on. We will be soldering a battery to the board, and flashing the proper rom, so it will properly use the battery and SRAM (This will work with FRAM too, this is just not the guide for it.) Let's Do It! : 1. Solder the new battery to the board, (For Gen 2 you will need to solder wires and tape down your battery). 2. Clean the board, you never know how dirty the rom and ram chips can get, and pop it into your flasher. 3. Flash your game and test it, save the game and reset to see if it holds, if it did congrats you have a fully working game with much less jank and didn't have to sell a kidney. Questions I Expect To Hear (If this post stays up): 1. Why not just use FRAM? You can I prefer the authentic feel of the original gen 1/2 games with the time limits of the batteries, and have the tools to replace them. If you would prefer FRAM, follow a guide on youtube as your not alone, and people have done it before. 2. How do I m",

    "text": "My nephew stole my Pokémon Cards Recently I've finished my collection of every prime Pokémon card and have been working on my illustration rate collection from SV base- Surging sparks. Both collections have sat in binders in the corner of my room untouched for a month or so. 2 nights ago I decided to admire my prime collection that I worked hard going through eBay auctions and going to multiple card shops trying to collect every card. Upon opening the binder I noticed the center piece (Meganium Prime) was missing . I panicked wondering if it fell or if it slid behind one of my other cards but it was gone . Decided to look through my other binders I had stacked and of course my ceruledge IR , tapu bulu IR and eevee IR promo we're missing aswell. Checked my wifes binder to see if she had cards missing and of course some of her Raikous that she's been collecting have been taken specifically her amazing rare raikou that started her collection. We were heart broken but then it dawned on us that my 11 year old nephew has been secretly coming down stairs in our living space when we leave to go to work . We caught him once cause he thought we weren't home but my wife was there . After telling his mother the situation what exactly was missing and how much the cards were worth she told me he had admitted to them being taken and that he had a handful of cards at school in his desk that belonged to me. I wish the story ended with him returning from school with all the cards he had stolen from us but unfortunately my sister returned home with a stack of cards found in their desk and not a single one of them belonged to me just a bunch of common and uncommon cards worth about 2 dollars. It hurts to know that these cards I spent my money , pulled with friends and had watched on auctions for days be traded away gone forever. I know I can always get them back but I'm so hurt that it even happened in the first place and just wanted to share what is happening and how I'm feeling with ",

    "text": "[Community groups] The mole people of Edge Hill - secret underground tunnels, pointless infighting and financial ruin in Liverpool Most people know the UK city of Liverpool for The Beatles, their three football teams (including Tranmere Rovers) and having an accent that can be nearly incomprehensible to outsiders. Almost no one knows Liverpool as the site of one of the largest, most impressive, mysterious and bizarre complexes of underground tunnels in the world - but it is. Edge Hill is an unassuming and somewhat deprived area sitting on the eastern edge of the city. Once home to the first intercity railway in the UK and a thriving, wealthy merchant population, it is now full of student flats, abandoned factories and tyre yards. Even the university bearing its name has long fled 13 miles north to Ormskirk. But in the 1800s, Edge Hill was a desirable area, away from the pollution of the Industrial Revolution, allowing the elite to look down upon the city that was building their wealth. One of the people responsible for this was the person who built these tunnels - Joseph Williamson. It's also home to obsessive groups of people fighting - often with each other - to understand who he was, why he built these tunnels, and just how many more of them there are, waiting underground to be discovered. Disclaimer - I am not involved with any of the groups I've written about here, although I have entertained thoughts of signing up - but I don't think it would work. Many of the volunteers are of retirement age and have much more time on their hands than me. I'm just someone who loves underground structures, went on a few of the tours, chatted to the volunteers and became obsessed with the tunnels, the story, and the strange, dedicated people who are trying to bring them to public attention. I think this sort of story is like a moth to a flame for a very particular kind of weirdo, and I recently learned that I am definitely that type. As many of those types exist on this subredd",

They charged my buyer a tax...ok but then decided to make me pay a fee on that tax? (Money that’s not even mine) so now the fee naturally increases on the money I do get. Ummm I don’t need to report $16 to the IRS. Also I don’t seem to remember paying taxes on used items a few years ago. What gives? Why are we constantly being overcharged for everything and anything 24/7 😩 I don’t really use eBay for this reason. I have another platform that doesn’t charge a tax fee. It’s just harder to sell books on that platform. EDIT: everyone is arguing that everyone is required to pay a sales tax in their state. That’s fine but why am I being charged a 15% fee on THEIR sales tax that is going straight to the government? This just makes the money I make on my item go down more.",

So I figured this one was fake... until I tried to find anything and came across a PSA authenticated version not numbered (slide 4) I read the description (slide 5) of that goldin sale, and it says something about some sort of redemption for a signed Jordan record breakers card. And some of those have UD stickers on the back . Mine does not have a sticker on the back, but it also mentions these could’ve been signed at a basketball camp or another sort of event. So maybe that’s why there’s no sticker. (IDK) I personally think the autograph looks pretty good. But Reddit I need some help in finding any info on this card and just opinions on it in general. I’m likely gonna send it in and hope for the best.",

The listing did not say eBay guaranteed but the seller via a message said it would go to the authentication center. I was quite surprised when it showed up at my door a few days later. Should I be worried? I have been scammed in the past and I’m a bit paranoid. The card condition fits the grade, crease by the left ear. seller had good feedback. Any thoughts would be appreciated.",

    "text": "I bought 16 boxes of Innistrad looking for a serialized Edgar. Here are my results (finally finished selling the cards). I got 5 boxes for free due to Amazon points, and I bought 11 boxes, so I paid about... $3,210 on Innistrad Remastered Collector boxes. I've been selling the cards via TCGPlayer, and I offloaded the bulk for $10 at a LGS. Here are my results! This was just a fun experiment, I wanted to chase a serialized Edgar, and see how much of the value I could recoup. Also: I saved a handful of cards for my own commander decks, and I saved a set of foil poster cards for my own collection, so there's probably about \\~$200 in cards that I'm keeping for personal use. Anyhow... * Cost: \\~$3,210 * Bulk card sale: $10 * Rest of cards sold via TCG: \\~$2,140 * Total: $2,150 / $3,210 = 67% So I made about 2/3 of my money back overall. Granted several of the boxes I got for free, so it would have been less if not for that. I did not get a serialized card unfortunately. I ended up buying one later, so yes... it would have been financially smarter for me to just buy the serialized and not bother opening boxes. However: opening boxes was fun so whatever. Fun experiment. Probably will not do it again unless I stumble into some \"fuck you\" money. Thanks for listening to my ted talk.",

    "text": "PSA lost vault card purchased on eBay. Reimbursement offered is under purchase price. EDIT: They are “now” reimbursing full value. TLDR: I bought a rare, low pop slab already in the vault from PSA on eBay for $830. PSA lost it en route to me when I “withdrew” it from the vault the same day. They are now only offering $500 due to comps in the form of a check or credits. Apparently my own comp of $830 is not sufficient. PSA can up charge us all day for card values and what not, yet when it’s time to payout for loss, they’re stingy. My problem with this is the disconnect between eBay and PSA in a short amount of time. I understand the two entities are separate and provide different services, but when they are so heavily advertised as being a seamless experience, it should be handled differently. To preface, I’ve sold AND bought dozens if not now over a hundred items back and forth to the vault and through eBay authentication. I’ve either bought/sold a slab directly in the vault, or had something shipped from the seller/myself to the vault to save on taxes. This is the first time I’ve ever had an issue. I understand that when something is held in the vault for a while, it may rise or diminish based on current comps, but when something was withdrawn from the vault on the same day of purchase from eBay, I think that should be handled differently. Had I purchased something shipped directly from a seller or even in the case of the authenticators, eBay would have reimbursed me the full amount, which I’ve already had happen before. In this case where the sale was initiated on eBay, but the loss was WITH PSA, I am screwed with a comp $330 less than my purchase price, and apparently my own comp is not sufficient.",

    "text": "Does eBay always hold funds? Does eBay always hold funds for sellers? I thought after 30 or 90 days they don’t hold the funds until 3 days after order delivery? Here was my response from eBay when asked about it. I have 100% seller feedback and 44 sales for a total of around $7,400 in around 100 days. Just making sure this is true and not a line of BS. From what I have read, holds are only supposed to happen for 30 days..sometimes longer..up to 90 days. That’s why I reached out to eBay. Below is the email response from eBay: Hello Christopher, Thank you for contacting eBay Customer Service regarding holds on funds. My name is Abhishek. I understand you wish to know the reason why it is still 3 days. I am more than happy to assist you. First of all, I am really happy to know that you have been doing really good in terms of your selling performance. I can see that you are becoming truly a great seller day by day. There are numerous reasons why funds may be held temporarily. We use holds to encourage best selling practices and to ensure both the buyer and the seller have a safe and smooth transaction. Funds are placed on hold to ensure transactions are completed successfully. In some situations, this means allowing extra time after the buyer has received the item – even if they have left feedback – to review their purchase. This also means funds are available to sellers if they need to accept a return or provide a refund to the buyer. eBay must adhere to certain legal and compliance obligations, outlined in our Payments Terms of Use, which require us to place funds on hold in certain circumstances. We must also ensure eBay remains a safe marketplace for both buyers and sellers. This means we may place a hold on funds for some transactions. These 3 days time is actually a normal time line for every sellers to get their funds, there are cases where funds can be hold for longer than that. But, you have been on eBay now for 100 days there are very less chances to getting l",

    "text": "This isn't meant to continue the fight about whether breaks are good or not. We all know they're controversial. But it's about an email I got and whether it might indicate something about the future of breaks. I broke with Chomps a few years back. No shade to them (save for that superfractor burning thing). It was a reasonable experience. I still get the marketing emails from them, though. Got one yesterday that said they're scaling back a bit. They have been selling a lot of breaks simultaneously (like 30 filling at any give time) but they've had trouble filling them up. Things have slowed down. So they're going to fill fewer at a time, as well as implement some changes to ensure things fill in a reasonable timeframe. I bring this up cause I'm kinda wondering if maybe this slowdown is widespread and maybe something that continues for a while. Or, maybe, Fanatics Live is getting the monopoly that Rubin wants. I kinda hope breaks are slowing down overall, so maybe that'd relieve some price pressure on boxes. I do break occasionally with a group that I've come to trust, and at times it seems things are slow to fill lately. So that may back up this idea that things are slowing down. Or maybe everyone is just temporarily broke from the Skenes craze. Or, you know, \"breaking?? In THIS economy?!?\" Anyway, not sure if anyone else got that or had any thoughts on it. Could be a sign. Or could be nothing.",

Problem is we used a double wall box and the entire thing had 6\" of bubble wrap around the case. With the machine inside a hard case inside all of this. Buyer opens a return immediatwly upon receipt of unit, and the pics buyer sent show zero damage on the box, it's still perfect. The pics of the \"damage\" on the unit is one panel that he removed and zero damage. The machine was mint when sent out, and the buyer immediately wants a 200.00 partial refund or he will return it. We deny and say send it back, it shows up today in the thinnest, most terrible beat up, old small box. With not even an inch of packing material. The machine is now covered in oily handprints and has parts falling out, so clearly the buyer, WHO RUNS A BERNINA SEWING MACHINE COMPANY. Took parts out and our unit does not function any longer so its obvious. Any way wife will be home later and I want to make sure she gets the best outcome possible, despite being so upset she got scammed. I thought she could deduct 50% as a top rated seller, but I cannot find where it lets me do so when I hit report buyer, ot just gives an option to refund. Should she call Ebay tomorrow as the package just showed up this afternoon and try to get them involved? Or will she just lose a case, most likely, and pay an extra 20.00 if the case does not close in her favor? Your thoughts please, she is pretty upset and I want to help her the best way possible based out what you all think is the best guaranteed/likely positive result. Thank you for your input with your past experiences! Edit: Ebay sided with my wife, they released the hold on her funds and she gets to keep all the funds for the entire sale.

    "text": "Micro SD Express Card Guide for Nintendo Switch 2 Nintendo Switch 2 comes with 256GB of storage right out of the box. However, if you own/buy a lot of games and would like to upgrade to a higher capacity of storage, you'll need a **Micro SD Express card.** These are different from normal Micro SD, Micro SDHC, and Micro SDXC cards, denoted by the **EX** on the card. Normal Micro SD card speeds range from [2-312MB/s](https://www.kingston.com/en/blog/personal-storage/memory-card-speed-classes). However, to bring Nintendo Switch 2 somewhat closer in line with speeds that the SSDs that PS5 and Xbox Series consoles use, the system requires the use of high-speed \"Express\" memory. These speeds are upwards of 600-900MB/s. The good news is that your Nintendo Switch 2 games will load faster. Both the system and cartridges for Nintendo Switch 2 utilize the Express technology which have led to the high prices of these cards for publishers and the creation of the \"Game Key Card\" to avoid this extra cost. But overall, new games for the console will load much faster. The bad news: **your old Micro SD cards that you've been using for Nintendo Switch will** ***NOT*** **work on your Nintendo Switch 2 for storing game data**–inserting your current Micro SD card will only show your screenshots and videos, but you cannot play games off of them, be it Switch 1 or Switch 2 games. Micro SD Express cards are relatively new, but you can find some already on the market if you'd like to purchase one for Nintendo Switch 2. The small variation in the speeds of these cards are a miniscule difference and likely won't matter in everday gaming use. ***Note - be careful you buy an \"Express\" card, and not an \"Extreme\" card, as Extreme cards are not Express.*** Again, look for the \"EX\" on the card itself.

    "text": "What I redeemed vs. what I ended up getting I started with the biggest Cardinals card that's ever been made. I bought it on eBay after selling a huge Yankees card from Triple Threads Topps decided they couldn't make the card. 3 of the 10 guys on it have now passed away. It's not unreasonable, but they substituted the first card here without even an email or a question, despite multiple emails saying I did not want a substitution. A Shohei auto /199 die cut. It's dope, but it's not even close to what I wanted, despite it being worth almost the same as what I paid for the redemption originally. I called Topps and spoke with a dude named Jesse. He was floored at the names on my original redemption. He sent a message to the redemption team requesting some Cardinals stuff to make up for failing to produce the card I desired so much, but made no guarantees. Fast forward a week and a half, and I had another shipment coming from Topps. They sent me a Gilded Collection Pujols auto /10 and a sweet Goldy relic /10 from Diamond Icons, I think it's a piece of his elbow guard. Jesse, you're the man. This isn't what I originally wanted but the extra swag you convinced the redemption team to send me softens the blow quite a bit. At least I have a couple sweet PC cards to put in my display case and may end up selling the Shohei to make my money back. Topps sure as hell ain't perfect, but they made this right, and I appreciate it. Hope y'all had a great Easter and enjoy seeing these beastly cards!",

    "text": "PSA for sellers that like to reuse boxes I've been a buyer and a seller. My account is in time-out now bcause f\\*ck eBay and their Buyer Protection for people that can't read a complete item description. Anyway, this has to do with me being a buyer. Was helping a family friend (senior citizen) with their older digital camera. Researched and the camera only took up to a 512MB card. I didn't have any cards that old but I found an eBay seller that did. Bought the card, and when it was it was delivered (I wasn't home but my wife was) USPS knocked on our door and had her write a check for the balance on shipping. So I get home, and I message the seller. He tells me he used eBay shipping (yes) and I confirmed the label on the box. Asked him why I had to cover part of the shipping when I thought it was all paid up front, and he had no clue. Took the box, contents and all, to my local USPS and as soon as I got to the counter the clerk says Clerk: eBay? Me: Yeah, eBay. I got charged extra and I... Clerk: That's our box. We recognize those anywhere. Me: Looks at box, and the seller had cut a USPS box open and turned it inside-out and taped it together. \"Ok, I see that.\" Clerk: That's a flat rate box. eBay postage didn't cover the whole rate, so you had to pay the balance. So I opened a case with eBay to recover the extra postage because it's not cool to surprise a customer with an extra charge. USPS had written a note on the box label about extra postage being needed, so I uploaded a pic to eBay but also made it very clear I just wanted a partial refund to cover the extra postage. Seller got the notice and messaged me asking me to close the case and said they weren't in the wrong. I message him back explaining that I shouldn't have to bear the cost of surprise postage, and that he should be upfront and honest with shipping and also shouldn't try to take advantage of \"free\" USPS boxes. He didn't agree of course. After some back and forth with eBay and making it very clear I wa",

    "text": "My little story About 9 years ago I got the sudden urge to relive my childhood and hopped on eBay to see what I could find. I wanted to buy an older pack to get that pure dopamine rush of being a kid, ripping open a pack and the beginnings of my gambling addiction (if you know you know) I found 2 Japanese booster packs for $17.52 a piece (now worth around $600 a piece) I said screw it and ordered 2. When they came in, I just sat there for almost a week looking at them thinking what could be in those packs. Do I chance it and open them??? Or do I keep them sealed like an asshole?? No chance. I was sitting on my couch and had my dog (Cowboy) next to me god rest his soul and when I opened the first pack and got the wiff of that 1996 air I instantly knew this was the right move. I sifted through that first pack and when I hit the rare card I saw this and immediately jumped off my couch making caveman noises as loud as humanly possible. My dog started losing his shit in the process (he was happy too 😂) it was literally like hitting a lottery ticket. This was the one we all wanted and I never got to actually find as a kid. From that point on I’ve kept the passion alive and continued to collect. So in a way this card was what got me back into the hobby. I always told myself for years I was going to get it graded so I can keep it preserved forever. A couple months ago I finally had the chance to do that when I saw GameStop was doing PSA submissions and got it back a few days ago. I couldn’t be more happy and this is one I will have forever.",

The seller messages me to cancel it, telling me it will come in. I didn’t cancel it and he messages me, calling me conniving and callous.

    "text": "How I pre-grade my cards before submitting. A guideline to getting 9s and 10s more frequently. So there was a request to go into more detail about pre-grading so I thought I would follow up with what I personally do. Im sure there are plenty of other ways people do it. This is my method. First thing is I will create 2 piles of cards that are contenders. I do a brief scan, look for obvious whitening and off centering. 1 pile is cards I think are strong 10s, while the other pile is 9's + I start with centering first and foremost. Its the most obvious to see so I will scan the cards, and the front of the card is more strict than the back, so I look for pretty much 45/55 centering on cards, and if you arent sure, take some time to look through PSA 10 sold listings on ebay. PSA does make occasional mistakes but it will give you an idea for what good centering looks like. The second thing I will do is look at the back, centering on the back is more lenient but the main thing im looking for is whitening. You can still get a PSA 10 with 2 whitening spots if they arent too bad, 1 is still a 10, and none is even better. Than the next thing I look for on both sides of the cards is any dents, dings, any type of damage what so ever. It will automatically drop your card to a 5-7 even if its a tiny ding you can barely notice. It has a HUGE impact on the grade. The next thing I look at is edges, sometimes the cards have bad edges and its hard to tell but when you compare it to other cards you start to notice that some are clearly worse than others. Its hard to tell sometimes since its so thin, but sometimes it seems like entire cards have these micro dents along the edges and it destroys the gradability and is pretty hard to notice. The last thing I look for and I look real close at multiple angles is any surface issues and scratches on the card. Print lines still happen, scratches still happen. Lately ive noticed random scratches on the backs of the cards more than usual. I suspec",

    "text": "A brief outline of grading pokemon cards. When,what, and why to grade. I see a lot of questions being asked about card grading and a lot of bad information and misconceptions. I will spare you guys a whole book and keep it as concise as possible. In the hobby no matter what shop you go to, what card show, what message board you stumble upon, or which youtuber you watch, it seems like having graded cards is essential to participating in the hobby. While grading is quite popular in pokemon due to the hobby being 90% collectors and investors, in other card games that are built more of players, grading is virtually non existent with the exception of a few cases like vintage magic and numbered cards. Pokemon is completely fueled by hype, and has always been since the day the cards came out. We all had Beckett collector and pojo magazines to research the prices of our cards, and since day one its been a very collectible and value driven card game. Grading got popular during the logan paul boom from the poketubers of the time showing how it was a very profitable money making method and it was as simple as buying a raw card from a shop, grading it, and making profit. Obviously as the popularity grew with logan paul and the insane values of the cards like the 20k bulbasaur(/s) everyone decided to start grading cards, which led to the infamous 1 year + bulk turnaround time on PSA. In this day and age in the hobby grading is so well known and so essential that PSA 9's in a very large amount of cases are worth about the same as the raw cards. The price disparity shrunk rapidly as more and more people starting grading for profit to the point where it is right now which is either psa 10 or bust. Now the main reason to grade a card is to 1, authenticate, and 2 maximize the price discovery. Authenticating real cards is important for obvious reasons. Take a 1/1 card like the one ring in magic for example, even if its grades a psa 5, its important to know its authentic and its offici",

    "text": "Pricing: a guide(ish) A fair amount of the questions in this sub are about pricing, and I thought I’d put together a short guide to help newer bookkeepers navigate this aspect of things since pricing can be tricky. The most common piece of feedback I’ve seen given here by experienced bookkeepers is that you don’t have enough information from the client. It’s not enough to know the number of accounts and number of transactions. You need to know the COMPOSITION of those transactions. If a client has 300 transactions, are those 10 invoices via direct ACH deposit and 290 simple expenses via credit card that can be sorted via auto add rules? Or is it a cacophony of 147 invoices in a POS system where fees need to be entered manually or via a clearing account, 16 returns, 4 credit card credits, 34 checks that need to be verified against the bank statement, 8 transfers to PayPal, 10 owner’s draws, 2 random AR in Quickbooks because the POS wasn’t compatible with a few client payments, 6 loan payments split between principal and interest, 8 payroll transactions (4 for wages, 4 for taxes), 2 charges for little Betty’s soccer camp that should’ve been on the client’s personal card instead, 15 purchases of fixed assets (via accrual basis, needing original cost and depreciation sub accounts created for each one, each time a new asset is added to the books), and 47 simple expenses (i.e. monthly software subscription costs, utilities, etc..)? To give the right pricing, you need to ask the right questions. Does the client want to track individual invoices per customer name or are they okay with recording more general bulk sales deposits? Do they want to track by location, by project, by product line (class and location tracking). Do they want receipt tracking? How is your client currently keeping their books? Will you have to transition them into new software or are they already set up? Do they accept USD only or do they accept 14 foreign currencies? Do they sell on just Etsy? Or Ets",

Known issues: * Still has trouble matching some cards to the correct one, will have to tinker arround a bit more * Prices are not retrieved live and based on last data ingestion (date is shown on results) Further plans / improvements : * Leverage Ebay api for pricing * Train model to detect slabs and find pricing based on that * Allow editing incorrect detections / matches * Add the option for people to send in images that have false detections to further improve training of AI Model If you want to try it out, feel free: [https://tcgscanner.tech/](https://tcgscanner.tech/) Still improving things, so feedback, ideas, or bug reports are always welcome.

I am a long-time collector of this hobby that recently came back after taking a break when the Sun and Moon era ended, and I despise this hobby. First, I can't even get new product because people keep buying it out and it is so frustrating, because I do NOT want to support scalpers on eBay. I hate prismatic evolutions with every fiber of my being, and I think that this is one of the most overhyped and \"FOMO\" sets in the history of this hobby. I can't go to one card show without these new-gen modern only vendors that started last month shoving eeveelution cards down my throat. No, I DO NOT want to buy your color dog for 2 grand, and I'm sorry I won't sell my cards at 40% because you've \"never heard of a rainbow rare\" and \"it's not expensive enough.\" I want to make up for lost time so badly, but I cannot fathom how people justify that a CARD THAT IS STILL IN PRINT (umbreon ex psa 10) is more expensive than a decently conditioned 1ST EDITION BASE SET CHARIZARD (which is obtainable with some wear on the card). Next, the Pokémon community's social setting has deteriorated as a whole, especially the people that represent this community. A lot of the Youtubers that have been with this community for years have bought into the hype and have turned out to be pieces of shit. Leonhart especially pisses me off, and that \"trade up\" video he posted really rubbed me the wrong way. Whatnot has also gotten much worse (although in my opinion the platform wasn't the greatest) with these giant streamers inflating the prices of singles even more, with their massive toxic fanbases buying into their mindless ramble. I know the Pokémon Company isn't at fault entirely for the scalping of the modern sets, but I wish that they prepared a little bit better for it. A longer waiting period between sets would be welcomed with open arms if they had more time to stock up o",

I won an auction for this card (a little over $100), seller being PSA and the card listed as being in the PSA vault. That was 2 weeks ago. I originally messaged because it had been like 4 days and never moved from paid to shipped, and they responded quickly and just said it has not been shipped but should arrive within the window of time. Now it is well past the window with no update (2 weeks). I have messaged 3 more times over this last week with no response. I opened a case with EBay that the item has not arrived. Funny thing is I won 2 other PSA auctions around the same time and both of those were processed and shipped normally. IDK if there is anything to be done at this point. EBay says they will step in on April 1. I’m guessing this ends with me just getting a refund but I want to know what BS is going on PSA / PSA Vaults end? Like did they lose this persons card and now can’t complete the sale and just went dark? Or does the original owner that had it in the vault have to OK the sale? I left negative feedback but obviously that is no real repercussion for them.",

    "text": "Value Help a.k.a How much is my card worth? Half the posts I see on the sub at this point are asking what the value of cards are. There’s a few different ways that you can find values online. 1. (130point.com) This site takes data from a bunch of different auctions and various websites all over the Internet. (eBay, goldin, Etc.) you can search by recent sales and a few other parameters. 2. (eBay completed/sold items) more or less the same as the first point it just gives you this information right on the eBay website. 3. (Local card Shops/Shows) Another great way to find out pricing is to go to a local card shop or a card show and see how much things are selling there. The market varies, but since Star Wars is not like sports where players can get hurt, the value rarely drops. 4. (Ask the sub) If every single method above has been used and no similar cards can be found then I think it is appropriate to make a post about it. I completely understand if there’s no similar cards out there, but I see a lot of people asking about cards that can be easily searched online. Cheers! Happy collecting",

The one that did me in was a streamer selling a 2024 Allen and Ginter base mini Jackson Chourrio and was overly pissed at the chat that it sold for “only” $6. Blatantly lying to the buyer that they “printed money” on overpaying on a base card (last sold for a $1.49 a few days ago on eBay) Not to mention one streamer was adding Wander Franco cards randomly to auctions for no reason.

    "text": "(NOT A DEAL) An attempted guide at buying EVERY Scarlet & Violet set online at retail in 2025 Hey r/PokemonDealsUK ! Firstly, apologies for a post that's not really focused on a good deal. Please forgive me! As we all know, the hobby has grown in popularity significantly over the last few months which has been great to see. We've got more budding collectors and shiny cardboard enthusiasts than we've had for a fair few years in the UK now, but the consequence of this which we've all learned the hard way is that actually finding product to rip and good deals to save money is becoming increasingly difficult. Now over the last few weeks, I've experienced far too many people from brand new collectors to stressed parents complain in public, on this subreddit or over on r/PokemonTCG_UK about how they can't find stock for any set anywhere. So that's basically the inspiration for this post. I imagine most frustrations will understandably be aimed at Prismatic Evolutions, but I figured I'd create this post to highlight how you can buy any set from the Scarlet and Violet era of Pokemon cards. If this post can even help just one person out, then my work is done! Before getting into it, a few potentially pointless things to note: - If you'd like to try your luck in public, your priority stores are places like: Smyths, WHSmith, Waterstones, GAME and HMV. Supermarkets can be good too but stock has dried up a lot from my own personal experience. - I've not checked every single online store, so if you can find even better deals, that's great! - Extending on the above, I've not checked Amazon as their URLs are too long, same for eBay too. But a few sets have Booster Bundle Boxes available. - While the standard retail price of a single pack is £4.29 (not counting special sets), these prices differ for other sealed products like Blisters and Elite Trainer Boxes and the price per pack (PP) is higher. Just chucking this in to be safe. - For a couple of sets, it was basically impossible t",

    "text": "Who’s in the wrong here? (Card show drama) I was at the Dallas card show last weekend, and on the last day, I spotted a card I really wanted for my personal collection. Before I made an offer, I overheard the vendor telling a friend that he hadn’t sold much at all he’d mostly been buying and he was complaining about there being too many flippers and not enough true collectors at the show. The card itself wasn’t super expensive, but it was an RPA of a player most people have forgotten, and I love collecting him. These cards rarely pop up, so despite the vendor being about $130 over the last comp, I still agreed to pay his price. I even offered him a trade, where I’d give him a much more liquid (and more valuable) card in exchange for his, but he valued my card at only half of what it was worth while he was still charging about 75% over comps for his own. Ultimately, I just decided to pay cash outright. We shook hands, and as I started counting out the money, he said, “You know what, seeing how much you want this card, I think I should just keep it.” I was in disbelief. I even tried to pay his full sticker price, which was $15 higher than our agreed amount, but he still refused to sell it. As I was walking away, I said, “I guess that’s why your case is still full.” He got really upset and accused me of taking a cheap shot as I left. I told him he was just being fragile, and he fired back that I was mad I didn’t get my way. I pointed out that we had a deal how was I not getting my way when we’d already agreed on a price? Things got a bit heated, but we ended up just going our separate ways. I just don’t know why you set up at a card show and someone’s offering you way more than you would get on eBay after fees and you still won’t sell a card no one wanted all weekend. Then get mad when someone points out your behavior as a reason as to why you haven’t sold anything. I think the guy needed a wakeup call. I don’t regret anything I said.",

    "text": "I am moving and have to get rid of all my stuff. What is the best way to get some value out of my cards quickly? So, I am moving to Japan at the start of April and need to liquidize as much of my stuff as possible as I no longer have a reliable storage option in the USA. I have about 2000 sports cards. I tried listing some on ebay but since I have a brand new account, I got no action. I have already spent hours separated my cards into these categories: * >$1.50 ungraded (only counting cards with recent sales and with some Mint 10 sales) * over >$1 (including over $1.50 without recent sales or mint 10s) * between $0.25 and $0.99 * worthless bulk I also further divided those 4 things weeding out HOFers and rookie cards. My top cards, imo: * 1986 Topps Jerry Rice rookie * 1986 Topps Bruce Smith rookie * autographed 1986 Topps Anthony Munoz * 1990 Fleer Michael Jordan * 1989 Hoops Michael Jordan * 1990 Skybox Michael Jordan * 2008 Upper Deck All-Star Lebron James, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, CP3, Kevin Durant * 2x Mark Jackson cards with Menendez Brothers (but not sure if the value is still there for them) * 1962 Topps Willie Mays * 1989 Bowman Ken Griffey Jr (which sadly is in awful condition) * 1992 Fleer Jose Uribe with birthday error (which for some reason has obscene value) I will try going to some comic and card shops in the area to see if they will buy them. I don't know if there is any consignment shop in the area but I will ask around. Google doesn't think so. There is a big sports card convention in town the first weekend of April but I won't be here for it but maybe I can convice one of the vendors to buy my cards at a low value? I am hoping to get about 50% value for my top cards, $0.25 cents a card for my second tier cards, and maybe $0.05 a card for the third tier.",

Then 2 different broncos cards back to back. Ok sure odds right? Then 2 of the exact same Paige Bueckers cards that went to the \"miscellaneous\" sport - same exact card. Then 2 hits for the rams. Then 3 vikings cards. 2 McCarthy cards he's hot right? Then 2 more dolphins cards. Another team hit 2x as well. So out of the 20 box break only 12 teams actually hit. With 3 sets of the same exact player. I get duplicates happen. But 2 of the same wnba cards is absolutely atrocious. Let me preface this by no I didn't skunk. It was just painful to watch. Got banned for calling out the breaker as well.",

    "text": "My wife went to the billiards store to get me a new cue as a birthday present... Luckily they told her it’s a real personal decision. So today on my special day when I came downstairs for my day off her credit card was sitting there with a note. I have been using a Star cue with a G-core shaft for the last 10+ years. Thought it was a decent cue when I bought it but also thought it was American made. Either way, it has been a great cue over the years but I haven’t played regularly again until recently as my 10 year old has shown some skill and enjoyment for the game. So I happened to be shopping for the last few months. I had decided between a couple McDermott cue’s but hadn’t ruled out other manufacturers. Wanted a carbon shaft, was thinking thinner diameter but wasn’t sold on it. I read through the cue guides here on this sub-reddit which helped me open up my criteria a bit. I had some cues saved on eBay as that seemed to have the most inventory. But after waking up to that note. I figured I’d open up my requirements even more and see what the local shop had. Now this isn’t a hole in the wall billiards shop. It’s a nice shop in a nice good sized city that sells nice stuff. They were going to be fine with or without my business, but that move with my wife sold me. I rode up to the shop thinking of those eBay Cue’s and how they were exactly what I wanted. I got to the shop and found 3 cues that matched my criteria. One Cuetec, one McDermott, and a wildcard Bull all carbon that was a winner on price. I was also waiting for the McDermott cue of the month as that would be another cool thing but this months cue was just announced and it hits zero of my wants (though the price is ideal). So that was no longer delaying my purchase. The McDermott happened to be this pictured SL10C cue of the month from last November and it was priced at the exact price of the eBay one I was watching. They had the exact cue I wanted at the same price as online! Happy Birthday indeed. It was ",

Thanks in advance for your help! I’ve read the pricing guide but it still leaves a few questions. First I’ll list what I have. Complete Sets of Series 1,2,3 in both holo and non holo - all blue label Complete Sets of Mewtwo Strikes Back and Pokemon 2000 in both holo and non holo - all blue label Additionally I have (all complete sets): - series 1 holo black label - series 1 and 2 non holo blue label - series 3 holo blue label - non holo pokemon 2000 blue label. My biggest question is that I am wondering how to go about pricing and selling all of this. I’ve checked recently sold on eBay and have comps for some.of it, but not all. I’m also curious if it might make sense to list the entire Blue Label complete set as one item, then list the duplicates and extras on their own. It’s all been in binders, sleeves, cases or sleeves and top loaders since about 2000, most of it is LP-NM, some of it is mint. I added some pictures of some of the pages / top loaders etc for reference. Thanks again for taking the time to read this post :) Also - I have some miscellaneous duplicates and bulk of all these sets, holo and non holo, that I’d be happy to send off to someone if they were able to help me get this all ready to sell!",

Gamestop needs to scale it's insurable value to provide a market for collectors to submit higher dollar value cards beyond $200 TCG and $500 Sports..

I wanted to list a working 16TB hard drive, eBay suggested BIN of $11. eeeehhhhh????? Even a non-working 16TB HD is more than $50 so I have no idea why eBay thought this specific brand and model should be sold at $11. I sell LEGO set that I pick up locally at clearance sale and had a couple of 76419 that I picked up for $80 new, they normally go for $170 retail price and a few on eBay for more than $100 used. What did eBay suggest for my 76419, new in box? $22 each!! I really wish I can turn off suggested price permanently because it's using unreliable AI that can't account for condition and/or completeness, and may have grabbed data off someone's replacement firmware chip for the hard drive or a gold colored minifig out of that LEGO set and assumed it represented the whole thing. PS multiple choice listing sucks too. $100 item with $0.99 microfiber cloth makes them show up first when sorted by cheapest. Also keep out of stock listing sucks, they show up weeks and even months as OOS to draw buyer who would think look at seller's other item and end up with a much more expensive item.",

Most people already know everything about the product! This isn't Amazon! For example, old digital camera listings will say that a 6.0mp camera is “crisp” and “high tech” even though people will buy something like that for a “vintage photo” look.

Ive had this happen too many times now and i had to make this post to get it off my chest. I just had the 102/108 mega blastoise from evolutions i purchased on ebay come in bent to sh**, totally ruined and creased. No top loader or cardboard used in packaging. Ive been looking for a clean copy of this card for weeks now and this one looked great, ZERO whitening on the back edges or corners. What a shame. This particular seller has over 900 items sold and 99% feedback so even some experienced sellers slip up. Ive been selling cards on ebay for a couple years now and wanted to give some tips for anyone wanting to sell cards online. I feel its really necessary to sell some cards, at least for me, to be able to continue collecting. I remember being intimidated going into it so I hope i can help even just one person out there reading this. Here is what i do, and i know a lot of people have different methods that work as well. This is just what is easiest for me, and what i feel is easiest for the buyer when they have to unpackage it. #Step 1 - Put card in sleeve. Pretty simple, i would go get brand new sleeves if youre wanting to sell a decent amount.(You can get 100 sleeves for $1-2 at your lcs, target, etc)You want your buyers to feel like theyre opening something of quality even down to the sleeve. Old/used sleeves dont look good and can have little specks in it that can actually damage the card in transit, especially in envelopes. The envelopes are run through usps machines that are very thin and can press the card down against any particles and leave damage on the card. #Step 2 - Put card in toploader. Top loaders can be found almost anywhere that sells trading cards. You want the thinnest top loaders possible for pokemon, which is 35 pt. I personally get 100 for $11 online. I also have some 55pt and 100 pt for card lots. Again, i prefer to use brand new ",

    "text": "I bought a perfume from an Ebay seller. It's a counterfeit so I returned it. The seller has now taken $100 off my return because \"it's been used\" I bought a full-size bottle of perfume from an Ebay seller a few weeks ago. Looking back, this was a dumb decision. The seller had about 30,000 sales and a 5 star average review. Still, I should have looked into this more. This was my own dumb mistake that I won't be making again, however... As soon as I received the item I got a bad feeling it was a fake. There was a sticker on the plastic wrap of the box saying it was made in China. When I took off the wrapping, the box was a bit dented and scuffed. The inside of the box was discolored as well. The bottle of perfume was slightly scratched and the cap to the bottle was scuffed up. I gave the seller the benefit of the doubt, though. Maybe this bottle had fallen off some truck and still could be authentic. However, I have a sample of this perfume already and I sprayed this bottle all of 1 time and it smelled nothing like the sample I have. I know this is a fake. It was sold as a new, sealed box authentic item. I immediately requested a refund, which was immediately accepted. The next day I dropped the package off at the post office with all of the materials I received included in the package (plastic wrap, sticker, bubble wrap, etc.) I just received an email saying the seller is only giving me half of my refund ($90 out of a $180 purchase) because \"it wasn't returned in the original condition\" and \"the item was opened used by the buyer\". This seems a little harsh to me considering a) this is a counterfeit item that I could not have known was counterfeit until I opened the box and sprayed the perfume, and b) the only difference between the condition I received it in and the condition I sent it back in was some opened plastic wrap and 1 spray out of a 75mL bottle of fake perfume. I'm wondering if I have any recourse for this. I know I can \"ask Ebay to step in\" by basically su",

    "text": "Toxic buyers make me want to quit eBay Sold a collectable statue back in January, buyer paid, I shipped, and I thought everything was cool. Then about 2 weeks after it was delivered buyer opens a claim to return stating it was \"not as described.\" Claimed a \"mold smell\" and a dented box. Ok fine, I'm not going argue. I accepted the return, buyer sent it back, issued a refund, done. I thoroughly inspect the statue to investigate the buyer's claims and surprise, find nothing wrong. Ok, wait a couple weeks and resist it. Sold again package it up and ship it out, delivered no problem. Lo and behold the same buyer bought it the second time around. I didn't realize it until he opens another return claiming the exact same thing. WTF?!? I know there is nothing wrong with it because it was inspected multiple times by multiple people including myself. So what the hell is this guys goal here other than to mess with my listing's and ruin my reputation with eBay. He's a reseller so it's feasible that he's trying to eliminate competition.",

    "text": "For this post I used the prices from TCGplayer. I have played Master Duel since day one, I know how to play the game, I haven't spent a cent on the game and I have practically all the decks I want, but I recently thought about starting to play the Physical Format, I knew that buying all the staples (ash, imperm, called by, etc) would be expensive and coincidentally I found out about the New Blue-Eyes Structure Deck, but what took me by surprise is the volatility and speculation of the **secondary market**. It's true that I could buy 3 Blue-Eyes Structure Decks for about USD 33, but to play the deck optimally I need to play the Primite Engine, and 1 copy of \"Primite Lordly Lode\" costs USD 129 and as a comparison a AAA game costs USD 60-70. Four months ago that card cost USD 3-4. I'm only interested in playing the game, I don't want to have to keep track of secondary market prices every time Konami announces new cards or a banlist, or every time a random deck performs well in a big tournament. It's true that I could settle for playing budget decks, but I don't think I can after playing Master Duel and Duelingbook and experiencing the freedom of playing any deck I want. For example \"Fiendsmith Engraver\" costs USD 56 but in Master Duel it costs 30 UR Crafting Points, and all cards are Free in Dueling Book. Waiting for current prices to drop won't solve anything because new cards that are equally or more expensive will appear in the future thanks to the powercreep. It's not feasible to play the game physically without interacting with the secondary market to a greater or lesser extent. Konami could solve this problem by printing the new cards in multiple rarities just like they do in the OCG, although it is possible that this will cause other problems since the Western and Eastern markets are different. The game recently celebrated its 25th anniversary, I'm not going to say that the game is dying or anything like that, I'm just going to say that every game needs a contin",

    "text": "Opinions on where to set up shop online? I have a shop, website (currently under construction to speed up processes, ease of checkout and better inventory system) as well as an eBay store where I mainly sell basketball cards; but have a little of everything. I decided to open the eBay store 3 years ago to try and widen my audience to help get rid of some basic cards that were taking up too much room, but still selling all my graded cards or even raw cards worth money that had been pulled. So basically a decent balanced selection....I’ve been a Top Seller on eBay since month 3 of my store being opened. I had to upgrade my store within the first year, because I was expanding so quickly with the amount of cards, memorabilia, and sports card products. At this point, I’m still a Top Seller and everything was going smoothly as I have around 1K cards or listings active right now. February marked my first month of not being a Top Seller, but Above Average due to eBay hitting my metrics with stuff like “tracking not uploaded or updated”, “Not shipped on time”, and a refund to a customer who lives outside the US and used a reshipper to get his card via PWE and complained within the first week and then on week two opened an “item not received request”. I’ve contacted eBay about all kinds of issues and it’s just circle talk, they won’t allow you to speak with a supervisor. They just put you off on someone else in the same department and won’t answer any questions or issues as an actual human. They just circle back around again.....so I’m ready to close up shop and set up on a different platform where I can still bulk upload, and hopefully bulk edit. So, ridiculously long story short....if you were going to or have started from scratch on a platform with 1K cards or so, what platform would that be? I’m a member of a lot of platforms, some that are semi-private and the rest wide open to the public. All fine with me. But I hate eBay so much right now and have since around October-",

I’m planning to visit a card show in June and I saw that the card show has what they call « on site grading » which I assume will be PSA and Beckett since they seems to be sponsoring the event. So here’s my question, how does this work? For PSA exemple, can I have economy service or it’s just premium that they offer on site? Can I just bring my card leave it to them and they send it back according to the service that I paid for? Something more specific for Canadians, since the card show is in Canada, I assume that this could be a really good way to go to save on shipping and custom paperwork? Thank’s!",

    "text": "Grading Fee Question(s) Never knew after all those years as a kid, my son would come across cards that have some worth and should be graded. But I’ve never done any sort of submission to PSA, so here are my questions. Basically, trying to figure out what to pay for cards that are on the borderline of a 9 and a 10 and the PSA fees are much different. One card in particular, the value of a 10 is around $3000. Drops to a 9 and we’re looking at $500. What happens if it’s determined to be a 9 and I paid the fees that valued the card at a 10? Will I get a refund for the difference? And what if I were to go the self assessment route of a 9 grade and it’s determined to be a 10 PSA? I’d be asked to pay the difference (?) which I’d absolutely be willing to do. Is it better to pay more and be safe? Also, there are a bunch of cards that I’d like to get graded, I understand you need to do one submission per card but can all the cards be shipped in a box to PSA? Finally, shipping. Do you take insurance out on the shipping or no?",

    "text": "Frustrated I submitted my first card to PSA this past weekend, a 1996-97 Topps Chrome Kobe Bryant. I only dabble every now and then in the hobby but I bought a box of Topps Chrome in June 1997 and pulled that card and some other nice ones like a Jordan and Ray Allen RC I don't know the ins and outs of grading but I think the Kobe would grade out to about an 8. No greening, sharp corners, but a little off-center top to bottom. I say \"would\" because I got a call from Fedex today and they said PSA refused delivery because the box had been tampered with. A flap was said to have been opened and retaped. So someone probably swiped the card. I'll find out for sure soon enough as the box is being returned to me.",

The Question i have is why didn't psa grade it is it because its a regular silver prizm with a sticker auto added on and a beckett authenticated sticker on the back? Also Would any other companies grade it such as BGS/SGC? I'm thinking about sending it to BGS and see if they will grade it but wanted to know if anyone has had this happen to them or had any recommendations! *Pics of Silver Prizm Sticker Auto Herbert Card Below - https://gyazo.com/27302c55ec0032c757daf2bbd5332764 *Beckett Authentication - https://gyazo.com/a267419dfe3499a2e8f112e1bd87b2ba",

I'm not rich, I live in Canada, I want a hobby that gets me to local events outside of my house. Everyone told me to look for cheap decks and build off those etc. Fine. I am in Canada. Now I chose teach because I like the character a lot and his crew, and at the time people said it might not be the best but it's servicable. Fine. \"shouldn't cost more than $20-40 to build entire deck.\". It took me months to actually acquire all the cards, and all the prices are wildly more expensive than what I expected. Where I am told a card is 0.12 cents in canada it's minimum 45, and often even 1.25 because every local store in Canada knows I have no other choice. So I end up spending like $100, which includes the starter deck, to build everything except the last 4 cards I needed which I ended up having to order from Ebay as a 4x and it cost almost $40 alone for those 4... now they've been shipping for over 2 weeks from the states. Finally almost here, want to go to local event. Trying my stuff on sim now for weeks and I have not won a single game in 50 games, I constantly get 1 turn from win and lose everytime. I am not that bad, I am a grown adult who can critically think, it feels unfair and no fun. I tried to build a green zoro deck at the same time and every single person told me its cheap and effective. Great. I got all the cards I needed for I'll admit relatively cheap. Then I needed 4x perona and 4xmihawk. Great. Everyone says they're like $2.50 each so another $20 isn't SO bad. Wrong. I can't get a Perona card now for under $12.00 for ONE CARD, same with Mihawk. I am looking at $100 for 8 cards, in Canada, to finishin a deck of which I have 43 cards for already. I constantly ask for help to see if I can replace those cards with others, n",

    "text": "People as a species have always been drawn to the \"Get Rich Quick\" idea. Remember the Publisher's Clearinghouse Million dollar giveaway after the Superbowl every year in the 90's? I bet you or your folks bought a magazine or 2 in hopes of increasing their chances of getting on TV live holding a giant check with Ed McMahon. Same thing with the national lottery, the higher the booty gets, the more people participate. Whenever someone asks you if you got your ticket you always respond with the same question: \"why, what's it up to?\" So it's human nature to be eager to grab wealth as easily as flipping a light switch... In 1991 a guy named David Hall decided to expand his business of coin numismatics into the trading card industry. He saw an opportunity to make money that required no capital, no sweat and tears, no inventory. In fact people would line up to give him their money, in hopes that he would grant them the privilege of being able to charge more for a card then the market decided it was worth right out of the pack. He would declare, based solely on printing quality, what \"score\" a card should receive. More about him in a bit. Today Collector's Universe, Inc.-aka PSA aka BGS aka SGC aka Goldin Auctions aka Card Ladder aka well you get the point. Collectors sits at the head of the table that not only decides what a card’s quality is, but where it gets sold, and how much it is now worth as a result. The term “stranglehold” comes to mind when thinking about how much control of the market he, and his clever assortment of companies have today. In fact it's an 80% grasp of the entire industry. That's, well, a problem. So our buddy David is no longer with PSA. But he's not done making money out of thin air. He now runs Hall of Fame Exchange, a company that grades graded cards. That's not a joke. He will take a look at your PSA 10 and give it an additional grade, from “strong 10” to “weak 10”, and reslab it in a HOFE holder with his seal of accuracy on it, for this servi",

    "text": "Headline: Do not buy Booster boxes, and overpriced cards. Do not fall for these new financial posts from scalpers. What the data suggests right now (Feb 2026) (I will highlight in bold interesting points) \\- Sales have not stopped, but they look “thin” on the top chase cards. For example, on PriceCharting (which states it updates prices based on listings that sold on eBay and other marketplaces), some **Fusion World chase cards show \\\\\\~1–2 sales per week volume.** \\- **There’s clear evidence of price inflation vs reality on certain listings.** On one chase card page, PriceCharting shows a big gap between an “eBay price” and a “TCGplayer price” (and then lists recent individual sales). That kind of spread is exactly what you see when listings get pushed up aggressively but the market clears at more varied levels. ￼ \\- Recent sold comps look volatile (**not a smooth upward trend.** For another chase card, the recent eBay sold entries shown include multiple sales in a short window at very different prices (example range shown roughly around the low hundreds up to the high hundreds depending on the specific sale). That pattern usually means the market is being set by scarcity + **speculation rather than steady collector demand.** \\- **Cardmarket “price trend” signals can show sharp cool-offs after spikes.** One Cardmarket listing snippet shows “From” pricing far above the “Price Trend” number (example: “From: 499,99 €” while “Price Trend: 109,90 €”), which is a classic “asking got silly, trend reverted” shape. ￼ So... are DBS prices slowing down, and was it scalpers? Best read based on what I can see: For the hype items (chase alts, markers/promos, manga-type product), it looks like scalpers/speculators definitely played a role in pushing ask prices up quickly, and the **market is now more selective, with patchy volume and wide spreads between listings and sold comps.**",

    "text": "I sell cards frequently across eBay, reddit, and facebook marketplace. I recently sold the Gold Mega Charizard Ex 130 from Phantasmal Flames on facebook for $515. I crossposted it on reddit as well, and was downvoted to oblivion by salty users, saying tcgplayer market was $348 and that my item was overpriced, despite selling for ask within 15 minutes of listing and had multiple ready buyers at $515. This post is a disclaimer for buyers and sellers to explore more than one way to comp their items as I've often found tcgplayer's algorithm for determining market price is often laggard to the accurate market sales. It's very often that I'm \"lowballed\" by those choosing to go based off tcgplayer as reason to price their items and I want those to avoid using that as the golden standard for pricing. Most LCS use tcgplayer pricing as well. **Card (NM copies)** |**tcgplayer** |**AVG of last 6 sold** |**pricecharting (eBay)** |**AVG of last 6** Mega Charizard X 130 |$350 |$377 ($27 difference) |$450 |$445 ($5 diff) Team Rocket's Mewtwo |$376 |$406 ($30) |$403 |$425 ($22) Umbreon 161 |$840 |$957 ($117) |$999 |$1073 ($74) Giratina V 186 |$658 |$598 ($60) |$570 |$559 ($11) Dragonite V 192 |$394 |$371 ($23) |$358 |$350 ($8) Mega Charizard X 125 |$637 |$712 ($75) |$784 |$886 ($102) As you can tell, the difference between market price and last 6 sold for tcgplayer is much greater than ebay. This data was not cherry picked, i just chose popular modern chase cards off the top of my head. I included the Mega Charizard SIR to show that \"market\" on tcg is $637 but there's sales today on eBay at $1000 raw. Often only one sale every few days, compared to eBay's multiple daily I would personally choose to comp based on eBay as there's more sales volume as well as actual images. The centering of a modern card is heavily weighted into the card's price and this is taken out of the equation for tcgplayer, thus leading to lower sales prices. Vintage being the exception, where there are very dis",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I used Claude to help write this post. If that bothers you please close your eyes. Ain’t no fucking way I’m writing a post like this from scratch, but I do think it’s a good pitch and should be considered. I’m here for good DD, if ai can help, why are we limiting ourselves from discussion? **TL;DR:** Collectors Holdings CEO sits on GameStop’s board for free. PE investors (including Steve Cohen’s family office) need an exit after 5 years. GameStop has $9B+ in cash. The same Steve Cohen who bailed out Melvin Capital in January 2021 may have no choice but to sell Ryan Cohen the dominant force in collectibles authentication. ----- ##The Board Seat That Doesn’t Make Sense (Unless It Does) In November 2024, GameStop appointed Nat Turner—Chairman and CEO of Collectors Holdings—to its Board of Directors. One month earlier, GameStop became an authorized PSA dealer. Ryan Cohen’s board is tight and hand-picked. You don’t get a seat for a dealer agreement. Turner receives no compensation for his board role. He’s the CEO of a company valued at $4.3 billion, sitting on GameStop’s board for free. **Why?** Because when this deal closes, he’ll be one of the largest GameStop shareholders. ----- ##What is Collectors Holdings? Collectors has quietly consolidated the entire collectibles authentication industry: |Brand |Category |Position | |-------|----------------------|-----------------------------| |PSA |Trading cards |#1 globally, 71% market share| |SGC |Trading cards |Acquired Feb 2024 | |Beckett|Trading cards & comics|Acquired Dec 2025 | |PCGS |Coins & currency |Industry leader | |WATA |Video games |Industry leader | |Goldin |Auction marketplace |Premium collectibles | According to GemRate, PSA graded 18.3+ million cards in 2025. **Combined with SGC and Beckett, Collectors now owns 79% of all card grading.** They don’t dominate the market.

    "text": "**TLDR:** There are no easy ways to get Pokemon cards without spending a lot per pack, sorry. But since a lot of people keep posting and asking, this'll break down what else you can try. **Why cant I find cards:** \\-2025 Popularity Surge and Price Bubble - Starting late 2024 Pokemon card popularity began to once again surge, with the surge came scarcity as product was unable to be fulfilled to meet demand. This unprecedented demand was met with surging prices as well beginning a ridiculous value increase spiral that has caught the eyes of not just the general public but also big money investors. The more money that gets focused into the hobby, the more people start to hear about it, and unfortunately the more people try finding opportunity to make money from others in the hobby. \\-Scalpers - These are the people who follow around card vendors, buy everything they can so that others cant get it, then flip it for 2x or 3x price. If you are dedicated and thorough you can make some serious money doing this BUT IT IS HIGHLY RISKY. One bad buy could tie up thousands and waste your time trying to sell. \\-Cardshops - In response to the popularity and scalpers, many shops have taken to raising prices themselves to take in as much profit while the market is hot. Some may be scalpers themselves hitting up stores to stock their own store, or they can be in cahoots with scalpers buying at just under market price to resell above market price since its still tough to find cards. Its a two way street that never benefits the general buyer. \\-Grading - You pay a company (hopefully reputable) to assess the condition of your card. This is usually done for 2 of the many reasons, protection or resale. Since factories are pumping cards out in a mad rush, quality control is terrible. If a card is assessed at Gem Mint condition (usually listed as a 10) then it is likely in the top percentage of condition for that card, this gives it a massive premium. A card worth $100 normally can jump to ",

    "text": "Pay with Consignment Alt Auctions May 30, 2025 Buy Now, Pay with Future Consignments In case you missed it, we introduced a new way to make buying on Alt even more flexible: now you can use a cash advance from upcoming consignments to help pay for auction wins. Whether you’re looking to upgrade your collection or score a grail, this program lets you tap into the value of cards you plan to consign—before they even sell. How It Works Eligible customers can apply the cash advance from their future consignment directly toward the cost of a recent auction purchase. If the cash advance doesn't cover the full amount, you can pay the remaining balance through our standard process. Who’s Eligible? To participate, your consignment must meet these criteria: Cards must be graded or factory sealed Accepted grading companies include: PSA BGS SGC CGC Single-card consignments must be valued at $250 or more If your consignment only covers part of the purchase , the remaining balance must be paid within the standard 14-day auction window Step-by-Step Reach Out to our Alt Experts Contact the Alt Expert team within 5 days of your auction ending to initiate the process through email (support@alt.xyz) or the chat icon in the Alt app. Get a Quote The Sales team will evaluate your cards and send you a batch quote, just like a normal consignment. Approve & Send Once you approve the offer, you’ll receive a cash advance amount. Ship your consigned cards to the Alt Vault within 14 days . Settle the Remaining Balance If your advance doesn’t cover the full purchase, CX will add a charge to your account for the difference. You’ll need to pay that off before we can complete the transaction. Receive Your Cards Once your cards are in and your balance is paid, we’ll transfer your auction winnings to your Alt account. ⚠️ Important: If all steps aren’t completed within 14 days of the auction ending, the purchased cards will be re-listed. Example You win a card for $20,000 . You consign a group of grade",
