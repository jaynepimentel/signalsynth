I recently purchased a collectible card a Dodgers x One Piece card that was described as being in NM/Mint condition. Upon opening the mail, I noticed a massive dent and crease on the bottom right corner. This card is nowhere near NM/Mint condition, as that damage completely destroys its value. I ve been an eBay member for 15 years, with hundreds of 100% positive reviews. This is the first case I ve ever opened. eBay has stated that, because the card went through their authenticity program, the item cannot be returned or refunded. This suggests that either the seller was aware of the damage, or the authenticator failed to properly inspect the card meaning eBay likely skimmed through the process without adequate authentication. I ve tried contacting the seller multiple times but haven t received a single response. I also took numerous photos and even recorded a video of myself opening the sealed mail from start to finish, clearly showing the damage to the card. I spent $1,200 on this card before the Dodgers won the World Series, so there would be no reason for me to damage it myself or attempt to return it afterward. Again, I have full photo and video evidence and want to bring this issue to the public s attention. Since this was such a significant purchase, I m willing to take this further even reporting it to the news if necessary. Yes, I m willing to spend additional money if it means proving my innocence in this purchase. This is incredibly shady business and not how proper authentication should work. Authenticators should take clear, detailed photos of the card front, back, corners, everything. I am appealing this case, and I refuse to lose it. If anyone has any advice or suggestions on what else I can do, please let me know. I truly appreciate everyone who took the time to read this. CASE NUMBER: 1-499645782094",

This is to say that I'm aware people will claim a package was never delivered or stolen to dupe eBay into refunding them and keeping their item but it would make no sense for me to do so on this item when my account history is solid. To keep things short but simple: Either ways the seller told me to contact ebay and I did. Ebay promptly told me the seller provided tracking information that said the package was delivered and so I would not be receiving a refund. I do not want to do a chargeback only because I don't know if Ebay would ban my account or not and I'd rather not lose it over $60. I just wanted to know is it likely for Ebay to eat the cost and just refund a customer that hasn't had any suspicious account history for a relatively cheap item during an appeal? I'm also hoping the seller doesn't have their funds pulled because I recognize it's not their fault at all.",

It s been an up and down year to begin with but I imagine it s the strike that s causing my current slump. I see video games and have more quailty, sellable items than I ve had all year. I did not go into vacation mode. I set tracked shipping to more popular items and increased my handling time (I have started to drop the handling times again for my tracked shipping items). I have also started to sell on FB. It is annoying but I have sold a few things. I m just listing bulkier items for now. There s no fees of course but I can t get the same prices I get on ebay so it doesn t really matter. For shipping I have mostly been using Chit Chats. I just tried Stallion but apparently they couldn t scan my label and charged me $2 to print another one. I was butt hurt about that. Chit Chats has always been reliable but they don t service everywhere. That s fine, you just don t know until you get an order. If they don t service an area the next courier that does will probably be more expensive again, in my experience. So, how s everyone else doing?",

I just want to know if I should still contact ebay or not, dont want to get my sellers in trouble for the delivery man's mess up 🤷🏻‍♀️ thanks a ton!!",

But I *really* struggle to find economic readily available supplies of specific-size large/heavy duty boxes & internal foam/large bubble wrap/polystyrene sheets. I don't have space to hold these shipping supplies in bulk & the items I sell are all a bit randomly sized so I need to order in a specific box and wrapping whenever I have an order. I appreciate this makes it a bit more expensive than holding bulk supplies in advance, and that's fine, but the cost is currently too high for me to make it economically worthwhile. For example, I have a carpet cleaner I want to sell for ~ 50 (which is a fair price). It weighs ~10kg and needs a large padded box and lots of thick padding to prevent damage to the motor/plastic external parts. The courier will be 5- 10 so to make it worthwhile I need to get the shipping materials for ideally under 10 or no more than 15 comprising a large box of the right size & enough internal padding to protect it (either polystyrene / large bubble wrap or some kind of cloth padding etc). But whenever I look on ebay/amazon these things if ordered specifically cost 20- 40 making it not worth my while to sell the carpet cleaner at all. Obviously, I could trek round local shops to try and find a large box of the right size, but that takes too much time/effort and is unreliable/slow. Are there any London-based shops or online suppliers people can recommend that I should check to solve this problem? How do other ebay seller on here deal with packing up large/heavy items quickly & easily for shipping? Are there any internal padding solutions I'm missing? Or do people just take a chance on chucking items in a pooorly padded oversized box (but that seems destined for disaster with unhappy customers)! Any advice/other suggestions? Thanks!",

    "text": "my subreddits There's a seller on eBay I've been buying things from and they sent me the incorrect item a couple weeks ago. I was messaging back and forth with the seller (who would take DAYS to respond!!) & asked her if she had some other items similar to the one she originally advertised. Turns out she did & had some other things I was looking for on a list I had sent her. I said don't worry about a return on the incorrect item she sent to me I would just keep it and said just waive the shipping fee on the new order or something for the error- since I was very grateful she went looking through her collection & found other items I wanted. This has been back & forth for almost weeks I keep asking her to close the deal. She keeps saying \"I will send you a private auction\" ?? Which I had never heard of before. I kept checking my bids and offers my cart- nothing. Last night around 1:00am she sends me 3 links and they 2 led me to eBay \"this page no longer exists\" and 1 led to a listing that had SOLD this morning at 3:54am! It was the items I had asked her for! That wasn't a \"PRIVATE AUCTION\" she listed the items publicly on her page and someone else bought them!! Now she isn't responding again to my messages and I am so frustrated!! I am not sure if the seller isn't good with eBay or something but I am SO beyond angry! I have been going back & forth awaiting responses because she had some collectible items I have been searching for! She offered me a special price given the screw up for the previous order issue last month-- and now someone else bought the items I had her go look for! What the heck can I do? Is there any way to reach someone faster than through the messaging platform?",

    "text": "my subreddits Hello Everyone. I've been hoarding cards for decades and decided to pull some boxes out today. I've been hearing about GameStop working with PSA and selling PowerPacks that now include baseball cards. While scrummaging around the boxes this Nolan Ryan caught my eye since it was wrapped.

I've been hearing about GameStop working with PSA and selling PowerPacks that now include baseball cards. While scrummaging around the boxes this Nolan Ryan caught my eye since it was wrapped. I looked into values on EBay and saw some double printing of this same card for high values. Did a double take at my card and it looked a bit blurry. Snapped a photo and zoomed in only to find what looks like a double printing with the pink lines. Would this be considered a double print? If so, would it make sense to send to PSA for grading? Thanks. Topps 250 Nolan Ryan",

I bought the highest PSA graded 2017 Panini Opulence Jayson Tatum Rookie Patch Auto /10. When I look at PSA, it is highest grade of every variation as this is only 9 in existence. And is POP 1 of /10 with no 1/1 PSA graded yet. Basically I saw a listing for this at $3k, but I offered $1.8k and it was actually accepted! Regardless of what the real value is. I actually love this card, and I offered a price where I d be genuinely happy. Tatum is my favorite player and honestly I don t think I d even wanna sell it unless it s an astronomical offer. I m sending it to the PSA vault cuz I feel like it s that high value to me at least. But the question I guess I am curious about, did I overpay?",
