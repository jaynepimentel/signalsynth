I can't tell you how many times its happened. I find a listing I'm interested in, go to the description, and its just \"This item is a quintessential addition to your collection. With a plastic construction and durable metal details, its sure to last. It is manufactured by this company, a well-known brand in this hobby. If features a green color and is suitable for ages 14 and up. This ready-to-play item is 1:45 scale and sure to capture your imagination in miniature form.\" I mean, honestly, can't people see how awful and fake that sounds? The description is there to tell buyers more about the item and help them see if its a good idea to buy it. What I don't want from an eBay description is useless gushing. Added to that, I doubt its even an AI powering it. Most likely, its just a template that fills in the information you give it. Because it all sounds the same. Like, exactly the same. I've sold quite a few things on eBay and I've written detailed descriptions for each and every item. Its not that difficult. And you're more likely to make the sale if you put in that effort. I tried the AI description once and I'm glad I read it before listing the item because it told the buyer nothing more than they could clearly see from the title and pictures. Am I the only one who views it this way? So many sellers use it now and its so dumb.",

Earlier in the year a seller listed one with a price 5-10 times the typical market value for these things. OK, sure, hopeful sellers exist. Then a while later another seller clearly sees that auction and lists one in better condition for 10-15X the normal price. After that, yet another seller lists one for 15-20X. You see where this is headed? Now at this point every single one of these on eBay is listed for hundreds or even thousands more than they've ever sold for. And this isn't like a rare machine part that a desperate factory manager will buy to keep the production line going. I'm wondering if a market can get permanently broken. At least until a brave seller decides to list one for $1000 less than their competition to actually get a sale going again.",

    "text": "my subreddits\nHello, I wasn’t quite sure where to post this, as I’m still in shock and disbelief. I recently purchased a collectible card a Dodgers x One Piece card that was described as being in NM/Mint condition. Upon opening the mail, I noticed a massive dent and crease on the bottom right corner. This card is nowhere near NM/Mint condition, as that damage completely destroys its value. I’ve been an eBay member for 15 years, with hundreds of 100% positive reviews. This is the first case I’ve ever opened. eBay has stated that, because the card went through their authenticity program, the item cannot be returned or refunded. This suggests that either the seller was aware of the damage, or the authenticator failed to properly inspect the card — meaning eBay likely skimmed through the process without adequate authentication. I’ve tried contacting the seller multiple times but haven’t received a single response. I also took numerous photos and even recorded a video of myself opening the sealed mail from start to finish, clearly showing the damage to the card. I spent $1,200 on this card before the Dodgers won the World Series, so there would be no reason for me to damage it myself or attempt to return it afterward. Again, I have full photo and video evidence and want to bring this issue to the public’s attention. Since this was such a significant purchase, I’m willing to take this further even reporting it to the news if necessary. Yes, I’m willing to spend additional money if it means proving my innocence in this purchase. This is incredibly shady business and not how proper authentication should work. Authenticators should take clear, detailed photos of the card front, back, corners, everything. I am appealing this case, and I refuse to lose it. If anyone has any advice or suggestions on what else I can do, please let me know. I truly appreciate everyone who took the time to read this. CASE NUMBER: 1-499645782094",

The seller messaged me and stated they could see the tracking info on their end. They sent screen shots that showed they mailed it out the next day following the sale. It arrived here to the state where I live, then it seems wires got crossed at the post office, and they rerouted my package to another part of the country. On Nov. 20th, the package finally showed up at my doorstep. I left positive feedback right away.  I mentioned the delay, how this was completely not the seller’s fault, etc. and how the seller worked with me to troubleshoot the delivery delay. On Nov. 21st, eBay sent me a message that they were refunding me due to the seller not providing proof of delivery. This leaves me in a quandary. The seller has reached out to me asking how we’re going to settle this. I feel bad, but my concern is that they reached out to eBay and as a buyer, I don’t know what eBay does for the seller on these cases. In other words, if I go outside of eBay to make the seller whole (Zelle, Venmo, etc.) and eBay also makes them whole.",

    "text": "my subreddits\nI had my package stolen. Within 20 minutes of getting the delivery notification I went downstairs to my mailbox area where the package was said to be left and there was nothing. No images attached because USPS delivered it. I've been using Ebay for several years and have no issues with any purchases other than one where the package was being sent to a city that I did not live in and the seller refunded me because of their mistake. Ebay support wasn't used in that case. This package was a clothing item worth $59 and I've bought plenty of things on ebay worth a lot more. This was probably of the cheapest items I've purchased through the site. This is to say that I'm aware people will claim a package was never delivered or stolen to dupe eBay into refunding them and keeping their item but it would make no sense for me to do so on this item when my account history is solid. To keep things short but simple: Either ways the seller told me to contact ebay and I did. Ebay promptly told me the seller provided tracking information that said the package was delivered and so I would not be receiving a refund. I do not want to do a chargeback only because I don't know if Ebay would ban my account or not and I'd rather not lose it over $60. I just wanted to know is it likely for Ebay to eat the cost and just refund a customer that hasn't had any suspicious account history for a relatively cheap item during an appeal? I'm also hoping the seller doesn't have their funds pulled because I recognize it's not their fault at all.",

I'll paste my other reply here: \"I only contacted the seller because that is what Ebay prompts you to do when you initially go to them for support. I didn't even go into messages to contact the seller. When I went to Ebay for help, there was a text box that asked me to describe the issue and that message was sent to the seller when I though it was going to Ebay. Ebay said to wait until today to contact them if there was no resolution.\""

    "text": "my subreddits\nI've recently come across many (thousands+) of sports cards from my childhood that my mother had kept.  She passed about a year ago.  They're in great condition, in books, sleeves, breaks, etc.  In just going through some, for example, I have a many good Jordan, Montana, various decent rookie cards, etc. I've looked into getting some of these graded and it seems as though psa is the \"top\" or at least most used service out there.  Have any of you used this and how does it work?  Do I send my cards to PSA and they grade them and hold them until sold?  Is this secure?  Does anyone have experience with this? Really curious as in looking at pricing, the grading process can get pretty pricey pretty quick.  The payoff can be great, but out of pocket up front can go from $50 to $350 once it gets to them if I have a good card.  For the Mods, I have googled and checked on eBay a few times; cannot seem to get a detailed idea of what EXACTLY the process is (definitely may be me).  Feel free to remove if you can point me in the right direction with a link or info. **Yes, I have an active eBay store as well as some other channels for eCommerce.  :) Thanks!!",

I have to create a new account on eBay with a US based address and then create a new PSA Vault with that same email. Even if I used the dotcom version of the website it won't work because my account is still Canadian based. All this according to eBay support. Btw, most of eBay support don't even know what PSA Vault is and what I was asking. I ended up just paying shipping so PSA shipped the cards to themselves.",

This is of course a high value item - The card recently sold for $1,495 on Christmas Eve - just to give you some perspective. The buyer pounced on the opportunity and bought the card. Since this was obviously a mistake, I called ebay to see if I could cancel the sale and they said it was not possible. Even though you can cancel any regular sale for multiple reasons, sales for items on the ebay vault can't be canceled. Their advice was to message the buyer directly and see if he would ship the card back or pay me via paypal for what I think it's worth - this of course is a lose lose situation for a small business like mine since the buyer doesn't have to be a decent human being and not make any attempt to make me whole again. I messaged the buyer and told him the same, and as you can expect, the buyer is only willing to pay me the value of what the raw card is worth. This means in the range of $200-$300.... What a surprise! This is off by miles, but what can I expect? Someone to be decent these days and compensate me half of what the card is worth?!? Not a chance! Moral of the story: Don't be like me. Don't be stupid and double check before you list an item on the eBay vault. Take your time, review the listing multiple times if you have to, and then list the item. If you don't YOU WILL GET SHAFTED AND YOU WILL LOSE MONEY!",

I tried going into settings and after I update the phone number is says “Sorry there was a problem with your request “ or something like that. I called customer service and they walk me through other steps and it leads to a verification code. But the verification code goes to my old number. They also said because i’m signed up for the vault they can’t do anything? Even though I never used it. I tried calling multiple times and they told me every time that I would have to create a new account. So it’s either keep my account that I can only log onto my phone or start a new. I can’t believe I can just update my phone number. I keep asking why it gives me that error message and they are clueless. I been trying for months. It’s ridiculous. Anything else I can do?",

I see that \"Buyer’s premium fees\" and \"Submission fees\" are waved until 2024, but those are not shipping fees which happen after you withdraw the card, so you want to look at the \"Withdrawal fees\". And, no, insured shipping fee is not separate from a shipping fee. You will need to pay for shipping, and it will be insured, you have no choice."

    "text": "my subreddits\nThis just arrived in my inbox from ebay uk We’ve listened to your feedback and made Simple Delivery optional for more items priced £20 or less. This includes items in categories like Trading cards, Coins and Stamps, which are typically letter or large letter-sized and 100g or under. It’s an update that gives you more choice. You can choose a low-cost, untracked delivery option when protections aren’t essential, or stick with Simple Delivery to benefit from prepaid labels and automatic tracking, all at competitive prices. Simple Delivery comes with more protections There’s full coverage from the moment your item is scanned by the courier until it’s confirmed delivered. You’re also protected against loss or damage, and you won’t need to handle buyer claims yourself. If delivery issues come up, you can even request that neutral or negative feedback is removed through Seller Help. Best of all, late deliveries won’t impact your seller performance standards or service metrics. Improvements to Buyer Protection that support your sales As a reminder, we’ve recently reduced the buyer fee from £0.75 to £0.10 to make your lower-priced items more appealing to buyers. You’ll notice the greatest impact on items priced £10 or less. The updated rates will appear automatically on your listings. The fee is still included in the item price, so there are no surprises for buyers at checkout. You can now also use our live calculator when you list to find out what price buyers will see. Just enter a price to see the Buyer Protection fee in real time. We’ve also made some changes to how the buyer fee is broken out from the item price, so you’ll know exactly what you’ll receive when making or reviewing offers",

I ship to the EIS hub (in IL about 15 miles from me) using UPS ground, then as soon as it’s scanned as delivered to the hub, I’m done and out of it. I’ve had 3 this year now where buyer claimed INR on an EIS shipment.  eBay just emails me as a courtesy to let me know that they buyer has “opened a claim, but we’ve got it from here”.  I get to keep the sale and the money, and they refund the buyer. All 3 times, the item has showed within a week of refund.  They keep the item, I keep my money and the sale, they have their money back… Direct international shipping is bad news.  You’ll lose these cases every time.  I couldn’t believe they sided with you in the first review based on my experience shipping directly.",
      "Thank you for this comment! Very helpful and I will only be shipping EIS from now on. Got lucky that none of my items were claimed at all for the past 5 years but this is definitely a secret weapon!",

The seller offered 50% refund (so now they can do refunds?) or that I can return the item once I get it for a full refund. While I don't mind returning the item, I also wasted enough of my time on this. So what do I do? can I tell the seller to open an intercept with USPS and ask them to return to the sender.

    "text": "my subreddits\nI collect vintage computers, and I was scanning that section of the site a week ago and found a listing I was interested in.  It was a NOS part that the seller had a bunch of, and was selling as surplus.  The price was good, but the shipping felt high, so I wishlisted it and decided to think about for a couple of days.  The next day, the seller made me an offer that was about 10% off - not a huge discount, but enough to offset the high shipping, so I accepted the offer and paid. A day or two later, I got a voicemail from a number I didn't recognize.  The caller didn't identify themselves, mentioning no name or company, and just said they were calling about \"the eBay order\".  No order number, no item name, nothing.  I don't communicate outside of the platform, so I did not call them back. Last night, the seller canceled the order, with a reason being that \"the item is defective or no longer available\".  And, to be clear, I'm getting a full refund.  But I thought it odd that this would be sold out already, so I went back to the item page, and it's still listed for sale, with \"more than 10 available.\"  So this reason is bogus. My thinking is either the seller wasn't happy with the offer they made me, and wanted to back out, or perhaps they are not above board, and wanted to upsell me or pull a bait-and-switch outside of the system.  Since I didn't respond to their call, it didn't work. I reported the listing to eBay, but it seems impossible to get the attention of an actual human being over there, and I just got the standard AI response that they didn't find any problems with the listing.  While I got my money back, I didn't get the item I wanted, and I'm genuinely concerned that this may be a deceptive seller, and I'd feel better knowing that an actual person reviewed this situation.  Do I have any escalation options here?  It appears that I still have the ability to leave feedback for this transaction, so should I just leave negative feedback on this and call it a day?  I appreciate any advice folks can offer, thank you.",

    "text": "my subreddits\nTL;DR I ordered what I thought were original postcards but received modern reprints on post card stock. Should I give positive feedback or neutral? First things first, I didn't read the listing properly to understand that the seller was selling scans of postcards printed on modern post card stock and shipped from a 3rd party supplier. The seller had in their description things like high resolution licensed print and all postcards digital printed on postcard cardboard. They don't explicitly say that the post cards are not original despite the fact they have received negative feedback on the issue. So yeah, I missed all of that and normally I'd say that I messed up and give the normal positive feedback. Here is why I'm considering neutral feedback despite my mistake not reading the listing all the way. I assumed that the seller was just cutting and pasting the same description since they list 1000s of post cards so the description rarely gives any meaningful information.  With post cards, the photo/scan of the post card is everything that really matters. I have been buying a number of post cards recently on a similar subject and these cards were priced similarly to the others I've purchased that are 75 to 100+ years old. Maybe slightly cheaper than I would expect but not by much. The post cards themselves are also not quite the same as the photo on the listings, mainly the text that identifies the image was shown on the listing photo but not printed on the actual postcard. Most postcards have text identifying the subject but these do not. The postcard looks good and the image is as good as can be expected of a scanned and reprinted old postcard. I just don't like the idea of giving positive feedback to someone who basically has a bunch of postcard scans then orders them to be printed on demand and shipped to the buyer by a photo lab. I'm sure I am just overthinking all this and just looking for confirmation that I should just do the positive feedback and not worry about it. (I'll be sure to read the description better from now on too)",

I don’t know what’s happened, I don’t know what to do - I called my mailing place (who by the way, has new employees as of a month ago, so that’s what I’m worried about) and all they said was “yeah contact USPS.” I already refunded the first one and I literally can’t afford to refund the second item right now. I don’t know how to find proof of eBay’s shipping coverage to submit to USPS. What do I do?? Edit: I just remembered I had started putting my eBay payouts in savings in case of something like this, so yay for past-me. Thanks for everyone’s advice and anecdotes, and for not judging my panic attack (at least, not outwardly!) - I know now to pay for insurance, especially on higher-priced items like these. I was using this place because some of my non-ebay items are UPS, so it was easier to go to a “one stop shop”…but it’s clearly better to make the trip to the post office and UPS store, from now on.",

On top of that, he sent eBay a completely different product and is trying to convince eBay that is what I sold him. The package was brand new/sealed, stapled down, and bundle strapped. Here is what I think. The buyer lost the case on eBay but then filed a chargeback with their institution. However, his account says \"No longer a registered user.\" Either he got banned or just deleted his account. The funds are stuck with eBay and is ready to be released to either side. Question is: what do I provide for eBay? I already have QR code scan saying it has been picked up. Order number matches as well as order ID. Exact price that he bought it for (including fees) just to match his transaction history for the card he used. I can only provide 5 photos and  I am need of dire help. Mind you, the item is close to 5 figure. The item was sold via local pick-up. UPDATE: eBay released the funds to me earlier today and it had cleared. I’m still going to challenge the dispute for my well-being.",

How are you moving items that typically send lettermail? My sales have been way down. Frustratingly my sales are also down to the US, which would be unaffected by the strike anyways. It’s been an up and down year to begin with but I imagine it’s the strike that’s causing my current slump. I see video games and have more quailty, sellable items than I’ve had all year. I did not go into vacation mode. I set tracked shipping to more popular items and increased my handling time (I have started to drop the handling times again for my tracked shipping items). I have also started to sell on FB. It is annoying but I have sold a few things. I’m just listing bulkier items for now. There’s no fees of course but I can’t get the same prices I get on ebay so it doesn’t really matter. For shipping I have mostly been using Chit Chats. I just tried Stallion but apparently they couldn’t scan my label and charged me $2 to print another one. I was butt hurt about that. Chit Chats has always been reliable but they don’t service everywhere. That’s fine, you just don’t know until you get an order. If they don’t service an area the next courier that does will probably be more expensive again, in my experience. So, how’s everyone else doing?",

      "Just before the postal strike started I put Ebay on a 2 week vacation ...  I needed some away time from selling anyways so the break was great. I have always shipped mail as I sell a low cost item and always thought no one would pay higher shipping rates. After coming off vacation mode I set up Ebay discounted rated UPS and FEDEX and within a day was selling almost the normal amount from Canada to USA customers.  I was really amazed that this was the case --- If you have the right item and if a customer wants that item it seems that they will still buy. So when Canada post comes back I will set that option back up. However, I do think I will leave UPS and FedEx as options and each buyer can choose the courier they desire. I added this line to the start of my sale.... Due to a labour disruption with Canada Post, I am shipping via Ebay rate discounted UPS and FedEx (Please see options at checkout for the best shipping rate)",

I am an Aus post business member which means I get some discounts when I scan my QR code at the PO. I recently sold a record and the postage paid through eBay was $9.81. Postage charged at the PO was $11.15 minus $1.34 for being band 2. Luckily I have the business account or I’m losing money every sale. I have just got off the phone with eBay and they’ve said there’s nothing they can do and if I want those discounts I should be buying labels directly from eBay. This is not cool and I’m wondering if anyone has a workaround? Thanks",

      "I’m not sure I understand your question. Are you saying eBay’s calculated postage charged your customer $9.81 for postage, but when you went to pay for postage at the post office, it cost you $9.81 ($11.15-1.34)? But that is bad because it used to charge the customer the full price of $11.15?",
      "Yes that is correct. As an Aus post my business customer, I would receive the discount my end without the customer knowing, a bit of a bonus for me from being a regular with Aus post. I can choose whatever courier I want to to send parcels. Now eBay is charging the customer the discounted rate and quite often I’m paying any difference out of my pocket if eBay calculates it wrong. It’s been way off for a while now. I’m happy to cop it if I have to but just wondering if anyone has noticed this happening, surely it isn’t just me.",
      "Okay, that’s because eBay has started offering band 2 discounts via their eBay labels. This is what the eBay calculated prices are based off. You will need to change your postage business policy to something that gives you the buffer you need. Also, this wasn’t really a bonus for you. EBay charges fees on postage, so if the buyer pays $11.15 you actually only received roughly $9.70 (depending on the category and your store subscription/fee structure). So you really should make sure your postage prices have enough buffer to cover the fees."

    "text": "my subreddits\nI'm a small new-ish seller on ebay and for my smaller items I have no problem locating sensibly priced or free shipping supplies (I buy new/reuse old packaging sent to me & know a few local shops where they don't mind me taking their used boxes) and I can maintain a stock of supplies to send stuff out instantly. But I *really* struggle to find economic readily available supplies of specific-size large/heavy duty boxes & internal foam/large bubble wrap/polystyrene sheets. I don't have space to hold these shipping supplies in bulk & the items I sell are all a bit randomly sized so I need to order in a specific box and wrapping whenever I have an order. I appreciate this makes it a bit more expensive than holding bulk supplies in advance, and that's fine, but the cost is currently too high for me to make it economically worthwhile. For example, I have a carpet cleaner I want to sell for ~£50 (which is a fair price). It weighs ~10kg and needs a large padded box and lots of thick padding to prevent damage to the motor/plastic external parts. The courier will be £5-£10 so to make it worthwhile I need to get the shipping materials for ideally under £10 or no more than £15 comprising a large box of the right size & enough internal padding to protect it (either polystyrene / large bubble wrap or some kind of cloth padding etc).  But whenever I look on ebay/amazon these things if ordered specifically cost £20-£40 making it not worth my while to sell the carpet cleaner at all. Obviously, I could trek round local shops to try and find a large box of the right size, but that takes too much time/effort and is unreliable/slow. Are there any London-based shops or online suppliers people can recommend that I should check to solve this problem? How do other ebay seller on here deal with packing up large/heavy items quickly & easily for shipping? Are there any internal padding solutions I'm missing? Or do people just take a chance on chucking items in a pooorly padded oversized box (but that seems destined for disaster with unhappy customers)! Any advice/other suggestions? Thanks!",

For example, just this morning, here's an item in my watch list: It was also saying this at 8h 12m left, but I can't find the screen grab of that one But if you click on the item.... Suddenly it's £11 more expensive... Then look at the bids: Now it's back to £292.81 ..and finally return to & refresh the watch list: WTF? Whoa what? Now it's £13 more expensive than it was when I last looked at it!! It's not like it's had any more bids, or any bid revisions, in those few minutes. And if I refresh the watch list page a few times, it sometimes shows £292.81, and sometimes £305.21. The main listing page consistently shows £303.14, and the bids page is also consistently £292.81. I've noticed similar wobbly prices when I'm selling stuff. I joined eBay waaay back in 1999 when pretty much only people from America had heard of it. Actually the UK regional site had started a few weeks before i joined, which I didn't realise, and joining the \"wrong\" one has consistently caused me problems ever since... It used to be great, selling on eBay. But over the last 3 or so years, it's just got harder and harder - but at least buying was easy. Now it seems they're determined to screw that up too :( Also: Is this even legal? Seems to me it shouldn't be...",

I was messaging back and forth with the seller (who would take DAYS to respond!!) & asked her if she had some other items similar to the one she originally advertised. Turns out she did & had some other things I was looking for on a list I had sent her. I said don't worry about a return on the incorrect item she sent to me I would just keep it and said just waive the shipping fee on the new order or something for the error- since I was very grateful she went looking through her collection & found other items I wanted. This has been back & forth for almost weeks I keep asking her to close the deal. She keeps saying \"I will send you a private auction\" ?? Which I had never heard of before. I kept checking my bids and offers my cart- nothing. Last night around 1:00am she sends me 3 links and they 2 led me to eBay \"this page no longer exists\" and 1 led to a listing that had SOLD this morning at 3:54am! It was the items I had asked her for! That wasn't a \"PRIVATE AUCTION\" she listed the items publicly on her page and someone else bought them!! Now she isn't responding again to my messages and I am so frustrated!! 🤬🤬 I am not sure if the seller isn't good with eBay or something but I am SO beyond angry! I have been going back & forth awaiting responses because she had some collectible items I have been searching for! She offered me a special price given the screw up for the previous order issue last month-- and now someone else bought the items I had her go look for! What the heck can I do?

    "text": "my subreddits\nHey flippers. I’m having some weird things go on with my eBay postage prices, it has been happening for at least a month. I am an Aus post business member which means I get some discounts when I scan my QR code at the PO. I recently sold a record and the postage paid through eBay was $9.81. Postage charged at the PO was $11.15 minus $1.34 for being band 2. Luckily I have the business account or I’m losing money every sale. I have just got off the phone with eBay and they’ve said there’s nothing they can do and if I want those discounts I should be buying labels directly from eBay. This is not cool and I’m wondering if anyone has a workaround? Thanks",

      "I’m not sure I understand your question. Are you saying eBay’s calculated postage charged your customer $9.81 for postage, but when you went to pay for postage at the post office, it cost you $9.81 ($11.15-1.34)? But that is bad because it used to charge the customer the full price of $11.15?",
      "Yes that is correct. As an Aus post my business customer, I would receive the discount my end without the customer knowing, a bit of a bonus for me from being a regular with Aus post. I can choose whatever courier I want to to send parcels. Now eBay is charging the customer the discounted rate and quite often I’m paying any difference out of my pocket if eBay calculates it wrong. It’s been way off for a while now. I’m happy to cop it if I have to but just wondering if anyone has noticed this happening, surely it isn’t just me.",
      "Okay, that’s because eBay has started offering band 2 discounts via their eBay labels. This is what the eBay calculated prices are based off. You will need to change your postage business policy to something that gives you the buffer you need. Also, this wasn’t really a bonus for you. EBay charges fees on postage, so if the buyer pays $11.15 you actually only received roughly $9.70 (depending on the category and your store subscription/fee structure). So you really should make sure your postage prices have enough buffer to cover the fees."

I ship to the EIS hub (in IL about 15 miles from me) using UPS ground, then as soon as it’s scanned as delivered to the hub, I’m done and out of it. I’ve had 3 this year now where buyer claimed INR on an EIS shipment.  eBay just emails me as a courtesy to let me know that they buyer has “opened a claim, but we’ve got it from here”.  I get to keep the sale and the money, and they refund the buyer. All 3 times, the item has showed within a week of refund.  They keep the item, I keep my money and the sale, they have their money back… Direct international shipping is bad news.  You’ll lose these cases every time.  I couldn’t believe they sided with you in the first review based on my experience shipping directly.",

    "text": "my subreddits\nI won an item in an auction for a decent price ( a bit under its value, about $10 under from actual value) During the auction the seller was very communicative and answered questions. Once I won the seller went AWOL, did not ship and did not answer any follow ups. After the estimated delivery date (7/23) I opened an INR case and specifically selected the I would want a refund option and not the item. I was/am required to wait until 7/29 before I can ask ebay to step in (not sure why so long) Today (a day before I can ask ebay to step in) the seller decided to send the item, and answered the case claiming that they saw my request for a refund, but could not issue one due to facing errors on ebay site and claiming ebay refused to help, sounds like BS They shipped the item tracked and it is supposed to be here by 7/30 (only one state over) I told them shipping it is not acceptable as they specifically knew I don't want it from them, and they are just trying to avoid a refund by now shipping it. The seller offered 50% refund (so now they can do refunds?) or that I can return the item once I get it for a full refund. While I don't mind returning the item, I also wasted enough of my time on this. So what do I do? can I tell the seller to open an intercept with USPS and ask them to return to the sender. I really don't want to drive to the post office scan the package (as I don't want them to pull and BS)? Will ebay help now that they shipped at the very last min?",

Please help! Does anyone know of any other way to escalate these issues, or can I reach out to ebay as I am concerned my 100% approval rate will tank because of this. Package 1: - Dropped off June 2 at USPS 6855 S Dayton St, Greenwood Village, CO - Never scanned by USPS, yet dropped off alongside three other packages that were all scanned. - Order value: $184.01 - USPS staff refused to check surveillance footage or offer any resolution. It's been over 7 business days. Package 2: - Dropped off June 2 - Tracking shows \"Moving through network\" with no updates since June 6. USPS has now verbally acknowledged this package is \"lost,\" but no official tracking record confirms this. Package 3: - Scanned June 9, later marked \"Undeliverable as addressed\" - Address confirmed accurate via USPS tools and with customer. - Label purchased through Pitney Bowes commercial account. Now returning to my home address. Package 4:  - Scanned June 9, later marked \"Undeliverable as addressed\" - Package billed correctly using USPS Ground Advantage with Cubic pricing (Cubic .50 tier). - Address and dimensions qualified under Pitney Bowes commercial guidelines. - Supervisor at the Greenwood Village location stated the package was rejected \"because it was billed as cubic.\" This is incorrect per USPS 2023 guidelines allowing Cubic pricing on Ground Advantage through commercial channels. Now returning to my home address. Package 5: - Scanned June 9, marked \"Undeliverable as addressed\" - Address verified accurate via USPS and customer. - Label purchased via Pitney Bowes/eBay. Supervisor said this package was labeled as only weighing one ounce, label clearly shows 13 pounds. Now returning to my home address.",

    "text": "my subreddits\nI collect vintage computers, and I was scanning that section of the site a week ago and found a listing I was interested in.  It was a NOS part that the seller had a bunch of, and was selling as surplus.  The price was good, but the shipping felt high, so I wishlisted it and decided to think about for a couple of days.  The next day, the seller made me an offer that was about 10% off - not a huge discount, but enough to offset the high shipping, so I accepted the offer and paid. A day or two later, I got a voicemail from a number I didn't recognize.  The caller didn't identify themselves, mentioning no name or company, and just said they were calling about \"the eBay order\".  No order number, no item name, nothing.  I don't communicate outside of the platform, so I did not call them back. Last night, the seller canceled the order, with a reason being that \"the item is defective or no longer available\".  And, to be clear, I'm getting a full refund.  But I thought it odd that this would be sold out already, so I went back to the item page, and it's still listed for sale, with \"more than 10 available.\"  So this reason is bogus. My thinking is either the seller wasn't happy with the offer they made me, and wanted to back out, or perhaps they are not above board, and wanted to upsell me or pull a bait-and-switch outside of the system.  Since I didn't respond to their call, it didn't work. I reported the listing to eBay, but it seems impossible to get the attention of an actual human being over there, and I just got the standard AI response that they didn't find any problems with the listing.  While I got my money back, I didn't get the item I wanted, and I'm genuinely concerned that this may be a deceptive seller, and I'd feel better knowing that an actual person reviewed this situation.  Do I have any escalation options here?  It appears that I still have the ability to leave feedback for this transaction, so should I just leave negative feedback on this and call it a day?  I appreciate any advice folks can offer, thank you.",

    "text": "my subreddits\nTL;DR I ordered what I thought were original postcards but received modern reprints on post card stock. Should I give positive feedback or neutral? First things first, I didn't read the listing properly to understand that the seller was selling scans of postcards printed on modern post card stock and shipped from a 3rd party supplier. The seller had in their description things like high resolution licensed print and all postcards digital printed on postcard cardboard. They don't explicitly say that the post cards are not original despite the fact they have received negative feedback on the issue. So yeah, I missed all of that and normally I'd say that I messed up and give the normal positive feedback. Here is why I'm considering neutral feedback despite my mistake not reading the listing all the way. I assumed that the seller was just cutting and pasting the same description since they list 1000s of post cards so the description rarely gives any meaningful information.  With post cards, the photo/scan of the post card is everything that really matters. I have been buying a number of post cards recently on a similar subject and these cards were priced similarly to the others I've purchased that are 75 to 100+ years old. Maybe slightly cheaper than I would expect but not by much. The post cards themselves are also not quite the same as the photo on the listings, mainly the text that identifies the image was shown on the listing photo but not printed on the actual postcard. Most postcards have text identifying the subject but these do not. The postcard looks good and the image is as good as can be expected of a scanned and reprinted old postcard. I just don't like the idea of giving positive feedback to someone who basically has a bunch of postcard scans then orders them to be printed on demand and shipped to the buyer by a photo lab. I'm sure I am just overthinking all this and just looking for confirmation that I should just do the positive feedback and not worry about it. (I'll be sure to read the description better from now on too)",

Presently, my workflow is: Template Scan barcode to UPC Auto-Fill Create listing title Set price List Next The biggest issue is UPC Not Found. Sometimes a code is for a niche product and that can't really be helped. Other times, it's because the disc may be Region 1 and not in the Australian DB or the UPC expired. I can list an item in under 60 seconds when I don't need to \"Sell one like this\". Blows my listing time per item out to 3 minutes (no stock photos, either!). UPC DB Lookup or other eBay listings sometimes have working UPC codes. There are also eBay Product ID Codes but they're only available to use via the API. There are a lot of options out there for listing suites. My computer is a little older and running Linux (to compensate for the age). In an ideal world, I would Scan, Auto-fill, Price, List .

I dropped it off to a local mailing place by me where I take all my packages - I just checked another item I sent out 2 days prior, and it also has not gone anywhere. It’s $200 worth of items altogether. Yet the other 4, smaller packages from that same day were delivered. I don’t know what’s happened, I don’t know what to do - I called my mailing place (who by the way, has new employees as of a month ago, so that’s what I’m worried about) and all they said was “yeah contact USPS.” I already refunded the first one and I literally can’t afford to refund the second item right now. I don’t know how to find proof of eBay’s shipping coverage to submit to USPS. What do I do?? Edit: I just remembered I had started putting my eBay payouts in savings in case of something like this, so yay for past-me. Thanks for everyone’s advice and anecdotes, and for not judging my panic attack (at least, not outwardly!) - I know now to pay for insurance, especially on higher-priced items like these. I was using this place because some of my non-ebay items are UPS, so it was easier to go to a “one stop shop”…but it’s clearly better to make the trip to the post office and UPS store, from now on.",

On top of that, he sent eBay a completely different product and is trying to convince eBay that is what I sold him. The package was brand new/sealed, stapled down, and bundle strapped. Here is what I think. The buyer lost the case on eBay but then filed a chargeback with their institution. However, his account says \"No longer a registered user.\" Either he got banned or just deleted his account. The funds are stuck with eBay and is ready to be released to either side. Question is: what do I provide for eBay? I already have QR code scan saying it has been picked up. Order number matches as well as order ID. Exact price that he bought it for (including fees) just to match his transaction history for the card he used. I can only provide 5 photos and  I am need of dire help. Mind you, the item is close to 5 figure. The item was sold via local pick-up. UPDATE: eBay released the funds to me earlier today and it had cleared.

It has improved greatly since then, however I still only make on average 7-8 sales per week. Which is way better than getting none, but when it’s only $3-$10 pokemon cards that are selling, you aren’t really making enough. I do sell other items too, but nothing else has really sold for the past month other than Pokemon cards so I stick with that for the most part. I mostly use variation type listings for my cards and I promote them all at 3%. I also scan my cards instead of taking photos of the cards themselves as that will take too much time. Most of the sales I get I noticed always have someone messaging for extra pics. It gets annoying honestly and I’m tempted to just put in my listings that if you ask for extra photos i won’t respond, but I’m afraid to do that since people asked that on all my card sales so far. I also put them on store categories so people can easily search for stuff in my profile if they go on it. I feel with all of this that I’m doing everything right, but it’s just still way too slow and I’m not selling enough. Is there something I’m missing or doing wrong?",

    "text": "my subreddits\nHave been selling on eBay since 2020, buying for much longer, but just had my first USPS package go missing! The long lines waiting for a dropoff receipt for a pre-paid eBay label always annoyed me, then a postal employee showed me the kiosk self scan and counter dropoff method about a year ago. Have sent a couple hundred packages this way with no issue, but about 8 days ago I scanned two packages at the self-service kiosk and left them at the end of the counter next to the postal workers. One, a $30 sweater, the other, a very expensive jacket which I added Signature Confirmation to. Sweater made it to the local distribution center that night, then its destination just fine a couple days later, but I started to freak out a little when the jacket still never showed any scans after 4 days. I frantically called USPS and they had just implemented a new policy that there is nothing they can do until there are no scans for over a week? Finally made it past that 8 day mark today and filed a Missing Mail Search, but I just know that package has got to be in my local post office (they claim there’s no way because they remove EVERY package every night) or the local distribution center. What are the odds that me adding Signature Confirmation tipped off someone behind the counter or working a truck that it was an item of value and they just took it? I will definitely wait in line for a receipt now (and have mailed 5 things since the incident and of course there was no issue) but I’m not sure that matters because I think it was taken by someone behind the counter or in the truck. TLDR - USPS package of high value has been missing for 8 days with no scans after counter dropoff. Am I S.O.L.? Will update if anything changes.",

Very brazen but I almost believe that more than a random customer walking up and taking it. And very likely it would have to be an employee that knew it wasn’t scanned in and came off the self dropoff counter.",
      "Chances are it just got damaged not stolen by a post office employee. Not everyone who touches it knows there is signature confirmation. I have shipped a package before through eBay that went missing for a month and then showed up severely damaged to the buyer eventually. I got reimbursed for the shipping but it wasn’t insured because it was a low priced item so I just refunded the buyer. But sometimes the severely damaged packages get returned to sender as well."

The shipping label was sent to me on 7/30 and the tracking has ever since just said \"shipping label created awaiting item\". The shipper says that the rims were in fact picked up on 7/30 and probably just didn't get scanned and that they should show up. I've been checking the tracking now for the last 10 days and it still hasn't updated. I submitted a missing mail search and haven't heard back from USPS yet but I'm pretty close to trying to file for a refund and order the rims from a different seller or have him reship. How long would you usually wait in this situation? its sort of funny cause I'm in Alaska and stuff never gets here by the estimated date in the first place. but it is pretty annoying having my bike out of commission for so long. Also if I get a refund and the rims eventually show up what happens then? Return shipping for the 3' x 3' x 1' foot box could easily be half as much as the rims cost (I have no idea how eBay sellers afford free shipping to here.)",

      "estimated free delivery was 8/5, though I'm in Alaska so that is never accurate THANK YOU for understanding this. Recently I had someone in Guam get annoyed that USPS took however long they take. like, surely you should be used to that by now... Anyway, you can file an INR claim anytime until 9/4 (30 days after the estimated delivery date). Personally, I would file it right about now. It would be extremely unusual for USPS to go 9 business days without scanning an item. In the lower 48, stuff is generally delivered within 6 days. USPS is having problems in the southeast right now due to the weather, but even if the seller's post office as affected, it should have at least gotten an acceptance scan by now (and I assume they would have mentioned it if their post office was destroyed by the hurricane or something). If the seller did drop it off, I have to imagine they put the wrong tracking number, or the label was damaged and not scannable. Also if I get a refund and the rims eventually show up what happens then? It's the seller's problem. You would not be required to return the item or the money, but if the seller got an insurance payout they may be required to give that back. I would be nice and refuse the package on delivery (or give it back and tell them to return to sender) so USPS sends it back for free. I have no idea how eBay sellers afford free shipping to here. This is why the cynic in me says they never shipped it and are hoping to weasel their way out of shipping it to you for the agreed price and blame the post office. USPS mail to AK and HI costs the same as from one coast to another (actually, from the west coast to southeastern Alaska is less than to the east coast). However, there's a good chance the seller priced the item expecting to be able to use FedEx or UPS Ground, which usually cost less for large items like this.",
      "Thanks I think if there is no update on the tracking by Monday morning I will probably order from an actual bike shop and start going through the refund process through eBay. Pretty annoying, was hoping to have the new wheel built by now.",
      "After I think 14 or so days of no sign that USPS even had the package it showed up, right after I submitted an item did not arrive report through eBay which I was able to cancel. Weird but oh well."

I have cards that range in price from $1 to $50ish with few that are more. Various Trading card games. Ive tried to search for the best way to ship these and I cannot find an answer that i feel helps me make a decision. eBay standard envelope seems like a disaster. Ive read of people that have used it for years and no problem. Ive read where the post office wont even accept them. Or buyers claiming DNR because the item never received a scan while in transit. I know ESE doesnt get an acceptance or delivery scan in the normal sense. Only the transit scans. Shipping PWE with a stamp. This is how i ship all my TCG cards under a $25. On there i dont seem to have an problems with DNR. Ive had 1 in 800 sales. I feel like with no tracking on ebay it just invites DNR though. Besides these 2 options what is the best option? If i select Ground Advantage shipping usually shows for potential buyers at $5 or more. Id appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or even rude remarks. I just want to be able to sell these cards effectively without worrying about it after it leaves my hands. Thanks.",

This seems to be self-explanatory but you'd be shocked how few bother. When it potentially impacts gifts, you don't want to make that mistake, as there might not be time for you to correct the issue. - Expect carrier delays Happened last year, should happen again this year. Check the tracking on eBay to see what it says first. If it's been scanned along the way, then be patient. The seller already did their part. They are not responsible for any delays nor do they have any extra insight into the tracking information that you do not. If it's been a long while, don't panic. The odds your package has truly been lost is remote. But do NOT open a case on the seller right away. That puts their funds on hold over something out of their control and puts a short time frame on potentially fixing the problem. Only do this if they are not responsive to your inquiries. Any seller worth a damn will put out a USPS Search and 99 percent of the time that gets the package moving again within a week. Communicate and give them the time. It's just as frustrating for a seller. - Note the seller's processing times Some sellers are able to ship same / next day. Many are not. The listings say this, so be sure to note that before purchase or at least before reaching out. I know ours says 1-3 business days. The sheer number of messages we get after 1 business day (or even same day) asking about shipping times is amazing. Listing says it won't necessarily make it out that fast in plain sight. - Shop EARLY. Like now. Right now. This is when the pro eBay sellers have their stuff up. If you see what you want, buy it. Don't wait days or weeks or later, expecting it to be there. Things start to move pretty quick this time of year and if you wait around, you'll miss it. I get messages every year from people who were watching hard to find items we had in stock, asking if we'll get any more. Odds are no, we will not. You should have bit then. This goes triple for this year, as retailers are expected to run short on all kinds of key gift items.",

It has improved greatly since then, however I still only make on average 7-8 sales per week. Which is way better than getting none, but when it’s only $3-$10 pokemon cards that are selling, you aren’t really making enough. I do sell other items too, but nothing else has really sold for the past month other than Pokemon cards so I stick with that for the most part. I mostly use variation type listings for my cards and I promote them all at 3%. I also scan my cards instead of taking photos of the cards themselves as that will take too much time. Most of the sales I get I noticed always have someone messaging for extra pics. It gets annoying honestly and I’m tempted to just put in my listings that if you ask for extra photos i won’t respond, but I’m afraid to do that since people asked that on all my card sales so far. I also put them on store categories so people can easily search for stuff in my profile if they go on it. I feel with all of this that I’m doing everything right, but it’s just still way too slow and I’m not selling enough. Is there something I’m missing or doing wrong?",

    "text": "my subreddits\nLast update: eBay refunded me the amount back! Seller never responded during the INR case. Their store for some reason has no listings anymore. Oh well. Update: Thank you for the speedy responses! I just started INR case with “I’d like a refund” option. Lesson learned to not wait too long and let eBay step in. — \nHello, I am the buyer in this situation. Remove post if not allowed but I’d like to see a more updated response since eBay and USPS changed a lot. I checked and googled. The responses vary (mainly from seller’s perspective but not buyer’s). For context, I purchased a card from a seller with good reputation. Shipped quickly but it stopped in NJ. Sept 19 Purchased Sept 22 Shipped from MI. USPS estimated arrival date is Sept 26. eBay estimated dates between Sept 24-Sept 30. Sept 27 Last location of the scan was in NJ. Sept 28-Oct 1 Statuses are “Arriving Late”, 12am each time. No updates since Oct 1. Oct 8 I messaged this seller about this delayed package. Oct 10 Seller finally responded and made Missing Mail Request. No updates since then. Today’s October 20th so I am close to the 30 days mark so I’d like to know the next step if I plan on getting eBay to step in. The package isn’t crazy expensive like I paid $38 ($34+shipping). I do know that INR cases will close if seller just copy and paste the tracking number which isn’t what I want it to happen. What should I do or should not do? Be specific if possible! Thanks! This is my first time dealing with this USPS mishap as a buyer. I’d really want the refund and buy the same card from another seller (and pray it won’t happen again lol…) Edited: Forgot to mention it’s USPS Ground Advantage.",

The photo for this one showed the comic with English text on the cover etc. However, the seller is based in Germany. The language listed for the item was “not specified”. I was scanning lots of listings and disregarding the non English ones but obviously “not specified“ didn’t catch my eye. The whole description and page was in English so it didn’t click to me that it might not be in English (how arrogant is that, assuming it’s the default language?!) The seller doesn’t accept returns. I know I can request one through the EBay Guarantee but would this be unfair of me? They should have stated on the listing what language it was in.

    "text": "my subreddits\nThis just arrived in my inbox from ebay uk We’ve listened to your feedback and made Simple Delivery optional for more items priced £20 or less. This includes items in categories like Trading cards, Coins and Stamps, which are typically letter or large letter-sized and 100g or under. It’s an update that gives you more choice. You can choose a low-cost, untracked delivery option when protections aren’t essential, or stick with Simple Delivery to benefit from prepaid labels and automatic tracking, all at competitive prices. Simple Delivery comes with more protections There’s full coverage from the moment your item is scanned by the courier until it’s confirmed delivered. You’re also protected against loss or damage, and you won’t need to handle buyer claims yourself. If delivery issues come up, you can even request that neutral or negative feedback is removed through Seller Help. Best of all, late deliveries won’t impact your seller performance standards or service metrics. Improvements to Buyer Protection that support your sales As a reminder, we’ve recently reduced the buyer fee from £0.75 to £0.10 to make your lower-priced items more appealing to buyers. You’ll notice the greatest impact on items priced £10 or less. The updated rates will appear automatically on your listings. The fee is still included in the item price, so there are no surprises for buyers at checkout. You can now also use our live calculator when you list to find out what price buyers will see. Just enter a price to see the Buyer Protection fee in real time. We’ve also made some changes to how the buyer fee is broken out from the item price, so you’ll know exactly what you’ll receive when making or reviewing offers",

I sold an Xbox and kinda just left the shipping part on eBay how it was and went into usps and scanned the item and shipped it.

If you don't, there's a good chance that the label you bought doesn't match the packqge you're actually sending. best case scenario is that you've overpaid for shipping, and you're not going to get a refund for whatever amount extra you paid. Worst case is you've underpaid. The post office could require the buyer to pay extra postage to pick up their package, they could return the package to sender, or they can electronically bill you through ebay. You have no control over which of these scenarios might happen.",

He paid UPS directly after they weighed it. It’s impossible for him to have under paid. Yes he overpaid because he missed out on the discounted shipping through eBay. But no chance in the universe did he underpay."

I had the card in my hands when I listed it and when someone asked about a possible issue with one corner. Stared straight at the things. Took pictures and yet, the authenticator reported a big crease across the middle of the card. I still can't see it in the image but someone said my scan wasn't high enough perhaps. I'm not even here to argue if it is there or the authenticators did it themselves. We're not in a position to know for sure. I sent a mortified message to the buyer, taking responsibility, even if I wasn't all that sure I was responsible. I didn't specifically offer to refund in that message as I was 1. shell shocked and 2. I assumed he would reject the card and the authenticator would send it back to me. BUt, the buyer accepted it. I thought maybe he jsut wanted to see for himself....I know I wanted to see it. But, it's been radio silence. There's no reason for a buyer to want a non-vintage card in poor condition. Why is he not returrrrrnnnnninng it!!! I\"m holding onto the money ($550) just in case, of course, but it's so weird. I had Pirate ship insurance on a package that stopped scanning for two months. They paid me for it, $1000. THey were nice, didn't ask alot of questions, great experience. Except a week after getting the check, the package started scanning again and was successfully delivered. I contcted them about returning the money. No response.....like....ok, now i have to hold onto that money until they pop up. I feel like all these shoes are in the air and i\"m at the mercy of when they drop, lol.",

    "text": "my subreddits\nGoing to preface this by saying I mostly sell a modest amount of old trading/TCG cards I used to collect on ebay almost weekly, and I make solid pocket change off it but nothing close to an income off of it. So my normal routine is listing items on Saturday and run the auctions for a week and then pack everything up on Sunday and ship Monday at my local USPS post office. My buyers pay for shipping and I pay for and print out USPS prepaid shipping labels, attach the bubble mailers and drop them off in the dropbox in the post office Monday. I've been doing this for several months with no issues. The items always show as scanned by no later than Tuesday and the item makes it to the buyer. However, this week I have an issue. It is now Thursday and none of my 6 dropoffs from Monday show as scanned yet and I'm getting nervous; one buyer already messaged me about this. Ebay guidelines say to ensure the package(s) has been on its way by July 10th (today). If none of the items change status today... what do I do? I don't see any options to start any kind of case for me as a seller. I know that I can tell the buyer to open a missing package case but I was under the impression there was something I could do as the seller as well. Is this not the case? Most of the time I would have a missing package case it's because tracking updates have stopped; in this case the packages have never even been scanned. And I know that this is a USPS issue but can I get reimbursed if these end up lost and what process do I need to engage in order to do that? These items this week made me a decent amount of money and obviously I shouldn't lose out on hundreds of dollars for an egregious USPS mistake but from what I've seen it doesn't appear there are protections for sellers. Am I wrong? One thing I do notice is that even though none of the items show as scanned, I see that ebay lists the funds as available and the orders complete. This seems odd. Why would this be? How do I proceed with this if there are no changes today? Thanks very much.",

      "Unfortunately the answer is \"cross your fingers and hope they get delivered\". I've had many packages that were never scanned end up being delivered, or get scanned somewhere along the process eventually. For the future it means taking your packages in on Mondays and taking them to the desk and asking for a receipt. That at least gets the packages their first scan in the USPS system and means you don't have to worry about that timing aspect of the eBay system biting you. Good luck!",
      "I should have typed that I figured this would be a response for going forward. But that said, for this instance now, is there any process I as the seller can initiate after today when the day passes ebay says to ensure the package like it says to? Or is the customer advised to open a \"missing package\" case when the items were never scanned? And what do I do to get reimbursed if these packages never make it? Obviously I need to have all my bases covered.",
      "Sadly there's not much you can do at this point. I would explain the issue to your customer that's asking, and ask for their patience through the expected delivery date. After that you can either just refund or have them open a case for a refund. If it were me I would check tracking for all the packages dropped off on the same day and look for scans (as an 'optimistic note' for the complaining customer - just to say \"another from the same lot has been scanned today so hopefully we'll see action on yours\" or similar). There won't be any way to get reimbursement if they never arrive - you'll just lose the product and need to eat the refunds."

I see an item, I scan it to see what it's selling for using the sold button.  I see that it's selling for a large margin than what I would buy it for.  I click on the \"sell one like this\" button.  I make sure it's the exact same model and features as what I'm selling.  I do this because the category and specs are already filled out for me.  I just make sure to write a description that matches the item in selling.  I also make sure the shipping matches (usually pick cheapest option).  I add my own pictures that I take of the item.  I don't do auctions, just buy it now (plus buyer pays shipping cost) for the price comparable to one that have sold in the past .  After item is sold, I buy my shipping label from eBay and print.  I then drop off at the delivery center.  EBay takes a cut of the listing fees and subtract shipping cost and I keep any profit made.  What would you do differently to maximize profit?  Or what do you guys do differently that works better and get your items sold faster?  Any advice is welcome.",

      "You have a pretty good process there.  Be careful with “sell one like this”.   Not all of the specs are correct.  Errors in the specs will be used by buyers as justification for an INAD return if the decide they want to return it.  It is better for it to be blank than be wrong.  You may want to write your own terms and conditions and use a template instead. You might be able to find a better deal on shipping options.  There are numerous shipping label websites where you can get cheaper labels.  This can save you a few dollars depending on the destination and dimensions. Make sure you understand ebay best practises for listings.  Also look into promotions as an option",

    "text": "my subreddits\n...that doesn't seem to work any longer. I know I've read a lot here in the past that if you have issues with ebay CS reps, you should call weekday mornings so that you can talk with the reps based in the US/Utah call center. Two mornings this week, I have spoken to CS reps who called me from a Utah number (via the callback feature) but were obviously not US based reps (had clear accents and spoke oddly). I have been having issues buying a particular item (memory card) and needed to resolve disputes as a buyer, but both times the reps did not seem helpful, which is unusual from the buyer's point of view. In this case what is happening is, I buy a memory card listed on ebay for buy-it-now, with a US location. After payment is completed via paypal, I see that the payment went to a chinese name on the paypal account. Then the seller sends a chinese tracking number (ID_____________CN) which never updates as valid or scanned. This has happened twice now, with different locations within the US given in the listing, and different seller accounts. In the first case, ebay removed the listing after my purchase and the seller account became unregistered. In the other case, the seller account remains active and selling more items from the listing. In both cases the CS rep made me jump through hoops of waiting for the delivery window to close and also communicating with the seller to request a cancelation of the sale, rather than just quickly investigating the seller account to see that it was farmed for this purpose and going ahead with the refund now. It is interesting that they are so quick to crucify US based sellers for the smallest of reasons yet they are hesitant to take action against obvious foreign scam sellers. Edit: as an update,  I was right.  I filed a fraud report on the listing and the next day,  the seller became unregistered in eBay.  Then I filled a \"not received\" dispute and eBay immediately refunded me, in spite of the fact that the delivery window had not yet passed.",

    "text": "my subreddits\nRecently I sold a card that had to do through the authenticator. I am the sole owner of the card in my personal collection, received straight from the card company. I had the card in my hands when I listed it and when someone asked about a possible issue with one corner. Stared straight at the things. Took pictures and yet, the authenticator reported a big crease across the middle of the card. I still can't see it in the image but someone said my scan wasn't high enough perhaps. I'm not even here to argue if it is there or the authenticators did it themselves. We're not in a position to know for sure. I sent a mortified message to the buyer, taking responsibility, even if I wasn't all that sure I was responsible. I didn't specifically offer to refund in that message as I was 1. shell shocked and 2. I assumed he would reject the card and the authenticator would send it back to me. BUt, the buyer accepted it. I thought maybe he jsut wanted to see for himself....I know I wanted to see it. But, it's been radio silence. There's no reason for a buyer to want a non-vintage card in poor condition. Why is he not returrrrrnnnnninng it!!! I\"m holding onto the money ($550) just in case, of course, but it's so weird. I had Pirate ship insurance on a package that stopped scanning for two months. They paid me for it, $1000. THey were nice, didn't ask alot of questions, great experience. Except a week after getting the check, the package started scanning again and was successfully delivered. I contcted them about returning the money. No response.....like....ok, now i have to hold onto that money until they pop up. I feel like all these shoes are in the air and i\"m at the mercy of when they drop, lol.",

    "text": "my subreddits\nI recently had two issues where my local USPS is telling me that the address on the label is different than the tracking. First, I had a package read as “No Access” on Wednesday before my mail would have even been delivered, and called to confirm that it would be delivered the next day. The next day, it was marked as delivered an hour or so after my mail was actually delivered but was not delivered to my address. Next, yesterday something similar happened where a package was scanned as delivered an hour and half after other mail but not at my address. My local USPS office shared black and white images of the label scan showing the tracking number with the other shipping address (name and house number blocked). Upon initial review, eBay is telling me the label was printed directly through eBay, and the second package is with a seller I’ve bought from before. For context, these are trading cards and I thought it more than coincidental perhaps that there was someone else there missing (9) packages of sporting cards. Has this happened to anyone else? What seems to be going on? Thank you",

      "You're getting scammed by the seller. (*Or you're making a mistake when choosing the delivery address when buying) The way it works is that they alter the original label and ship a low value item to a different address (but within the same zip code). Typically they choose a business address for example. Then it either gets marked on ebay as delivered or as a refused package. You try to make a claim on ebay and it gets denied because ebays system only checks zip code for the confirmation. The way to win the appeal for the \"item not received\" dispute is to get evidence from the mail carrier proving the label, with your tracking number, had a different address and sending it to ebay. Either a picture of the package scan or an email from the carrier stating as such.",
      "For the first package, I could believe it as it’s my first time buying from them and they used a relative passing as the reason the package was sent out a few weeks late The other package, I’ve bought from a few times as well as other confirmed sales with the page, so I’m scratching my head with that one especially and waiting on their response. This package was actually sent additionally from them so I don’t know why they would waste resources unnecessarily. I have the scan images from USPS"

    "text": "my subreddits\nTL;DR I ordered what I thought were original postcards but received modern reprints on post card stock. Should I give positive feedback or neutral? First things first, I didn't read the listing properly to understand that the seller was selling scans of postcards printed on modern post card stock and shipped from a 3rd party supplier. The seller had in their description things like high resolution licensed print and all postcards digital printed on postcard cardboard. They don't explicitly say that the post cards are not original despite the fact they have received negative feedback on the issue. So yeah, I missed all of that and normally I'd say that I messed up and give the normal positive feedback. Here is why I'm considering neutral feedback despite my mistake not reading the listing all the way. I assumed that the seller was just cutting and pasting the same description since they list 1000s of post cards so the description rarely gives any meaningful information.  With post cards, the photo/scan of the post card is everything that really matters. I have been buying a number of post cards recently on a similar subject and these cards were priced similarly to the others I've purchased that are 75 to 100+ years old. Maybe slightly cheaper than I would expect but not by much. The post cards themselves are also not quite the same as the photo on the listings, mainly the text that identifies the image was shown on the listing photo but not printed on the actual postcard. Most postcards have text identifying the subject but these do not. The postcard looks good and the image is as good as can be expected of a scanned and reprinted old postcard. I just don't like the idea of giving positive feedback to someone who basically has a bunch of postcard scans then orders them to be printed on demand and shipped to the buyer by a photo lab. I'm sure I am just overthinking all this and just looking for confirmation that I should just do the positive feedback and not worry about it. (I'll be sure to read the description better from now on too)",

Last week I created some drafts for the first set of auctions.  Used ChatGPT to help with formatting the description in HTML and finally found a simple layout I liked.  In the description I included some pictures that I had hosted on imgur.  Yesterday I log in to finalize the description and schedule a start date for my auctions, but was very surprised that all of the images that had worked last week suddenly are now broken links.  They were working last week, but now any time I try to add an image in the description, it's immediately broke.

    "text": "my subreddits\nSold a PSA graded Pokémon card on eBay, order total was only $12. I sent the item out at my local post office and watched them scan the item. Buyer sends picture via eBay Messenger that they have received the incorrect item. Pictures are of a completely different package, images are attached. The label is the same label I used to send the item, with my name and address, however it is not the package I sent. Unfortunately I do not have a picture of the package I sent, however I attached a photo of the boxes I use. I have sold around 50 item’s similar to this, and had no issues. Another finding is the tracking shows what appears to be two items being sent from different locations on different days. Screenshot of tracking attached. This is the confusing part: You can see the item was in PA (where I sent from) but also in Colorado, then in PA the next day, which isn’t possible. I can only think of two senecios: 1) buyer received item, copied label, and packaged a random item claiming that’s what they received. 2) A dirty USPS worker snatched the original package, copied the label, sent a random item keeping the Pokémon card. My question is, if the buyer making this up, why waste the effort for $12? Maybe testing if it works? I am extremely confused. I provided the buyer a refund, mainly to not get bad feedback, since it was only $12. The buyer seems genuine. Does anyone have any ideas? Do I waste my time filing a claim with USPS/eBay? I am worried because I sent two other items at the same time, but the tracking looks normal on those. Buyer is very friendly and is just as confused as I am. The buyer said the binder they received sells on Amazon for $16.99, more than the card. Did eBay mess up? Any help is appreciated.",

    "text": "my subreddits\nSo after looking around on eBay last night, searching for a second (emergency) cell phone, I put a bunch of iPhones and Samsungs on my watch list. They were all at $0.99 (used - unlocked) and had around 22 hours to go till auction close. This morning, I wanted to see how those auctions had evolved. To my surprise, the auctions were now exactly at $385 in every case for the iPhones, and $285 for the Samsungs. Checking the bidding history, I came across the same user bidding the items up, and then a second user going $5 above that. The items jumped from $32 or so, straight to $380 and then $385 (not passing by $35, $40, $45, etc). The funny thing is all these items are from the same seller, and all the up-bidder to $380 and then $385 were the same users. So, these \"different users\" are shilling this auction so obviously that it prompted the question. What the hell? How is eBay not seeing this? So, do I not understand that the seller may not want to let go a $300 used iPhone for maybe $50 or $100? Not at all, I completely understand that. However, that is why there is a Reserve Price option for auctions. Regardless of the fact that it is ILLEGAL to Shill your own auctions, in the end, it is a waste of time for the buyer to actually scan and watch all these auctions trying to hunt down a bargain, only to have the seller implement these shady practices. If they want a reserve Price, they should use that option. Now, how is eBay not realizing the obviousness of sellers doing this. Because, to be perfectly honest here, this shit is obvious even to me, without having a corporate policy compliance team working for me. This has happened to me so many times that I needed to vent and spend a little time posting it here. I am going to report the items, but I imagine eBay will not do shit about it. This seller is a Top Seller with over 90.000 good reviews, and still, they resort to this crap. I am off now, to spend another hour or so looking for an emergency cell phone to have as backup. Just my two cents. I have the images of the bid-ups, I'll try to post them but I am new to Reddit. E",

If you think there’s shill bidding going on, you report it & they look into it. And I have seen sellers lose their account due to shill bidding. \nBut eBay CS once aware can see much more clearly exactly who the bidders are, any past dealing with different seller and their bidding patterns. In your case they could just be 2 rival flippers who buy phone to repair & sell on. The seller may not be involved at all. Report it to eBay & move on."

All looked great when on the 6th the tracking updated to \"Out for Delivery\" as I believe this means the package has been loaded into a mail carrier's truck for delivery. ​ When I checked the tracking the next day, there was no \"Delivered\" status as I was expecting. Instead, it read \"Awaiting Delivery Scan.\" Well I looked up what that status may mean and the google result I found said that it could be where the mail carrier delivered the package but forgot to scan - makes sense. So I went along with my week assuming that's what it was, and that the buyer had gotten their item. Now today, I receive a refund request from the buyer saying they never got the item. ​ Obviously, I do not want to be out $200 on this. To me it seems as though I did my part in shipping the package to the right address and through the agreed upon delivery method (first class USPS). ​ I guess my question is. Who will Ebay side with on the refund dispute?

      "Unless tracking updates and shows the package as delivered, eBay will side with the buyer. You have to prove delivery. If the package is lost, that's an insurance issue. Hopefully you insured a $200 item. All that being said, it may have been delivered without being scanned and the buyer noticed this in tracking. Some buyers are keen on this and realize that they can keep the item and also have their money returned if you can't prove delivery. It happens fairly regularly.",
      "Contact the post office immediately, they may be able to resolve the tracking issue & get it show the package was delivered.

    "text": "my subreddits\nI have a handful of Fed Ex labels that were severely overcharged in the eBay invoice. To make it clear the actual scanned weight and size matches EXACTLY to what was inputted by myself on eBay's label system. I showed eBay's customer service who just claim \"that's what Fed Ex decided to charge you so oh well!\".. Now I have gone to my FedEx store who looked into it and said \"yes eBay over charged you from our real calculated price\". They won't help credit me because eBay's Fed Ex label system is under eBay's name. So I argued again with ebay customer service who eventually opened a service request and it just hasn't gone anywhere (ignored). I tried a long time ago to tie my ebay account to my Fed Ex account but that no longer works so I have to use eBay's system. Images are attached and any comments/advice would be great. Also all ground shipments were going to eBay's Global center (which accepts ground and its only these few transactions that did this).

      "Why is the Disc (Discount) now a positive number in every case of Actual Shipping? That is not a discount, that is an addon amount, that only benefits Ebay! Following this thread closely!",
      "Firstly, I'm going to give an out to the 3rd label as it's normal for it to be a few cents more. The others however is going to scare me out of using FedEx on eBay -- I rather use my own FedEx account and import the eBay discounts. There's a huge thread on eBay Community regarding this exact problem where eBay and FedEx give the runaround and basically the seller is ultimately at a loss. People even said they'd consider a class-action lawsuit in a few years over fraudulent shipping charges as their shipments were clearly had smaller dimensions compared to the ones that the FedEx dimensional machines measured. However, in your case the dimensions match, it's just the shipping charge is much higher. Smh. What a scam.",
      "I'm figuring class action suit also... I have had labels in the past be a few cents or may be a $1 more then normal, such as that third one.. I just let them all go it's not worth the fight, yet if they do that to millions of sellers they take millions of dallors in scamming them. Again all random different transactions... theres no rhyme or reason to when I get over charged."

Buyer bought (4) items total that each weighed 3oz and paid $16.99/each.  The right image is what printed out on the actual shipping label. I never paid too much attention to this, my main focus was just making sure the weight was right.  So I just let eBay autofill it and would quickly scan the bulk shipping label form.  This way my first time shipping to Russia not through GSP so I was paying a little more attention.  The customs value is actually $67.96 not $33.98 or $22.65, which works in the buyer's favor.  Not that big a deal in this case because I'm pretty sure Russia has a $200 starting point for Sports import charges. I don't know how big a deal this is for other sellers.

    "text": "my subreddits\nI have used ebay to purchase a fair bit of stuff and have a 100% rating and have had an account since 2012. Recently sold my first item, a local guy met with me and that was easy. I thought it was pretty ridiculous to charge him tax but ebay is the broker and whatever. Ebay makes me download the ebay app to allow it to use my camera to scan his code. That pissed me off, why can't I just use the web based service and enter an alpha-numeric code sent to his account? Why do I have to download an app?? Ok whatever I'll delete it later move on to the next issue.... Guy scans his code, verifies purchase and I go on to try amd transfer my money. And they put a hold on it to protect the seller. The guy let me scan his code and he checked the item out but ok, I can see the reason for that. Not every seller is like me and you cant pick and choose so ok. Next issue... I wait the 2 days or whatever to get paid. Log back in and it says it's my fund until they can verify me and I need to add my bank account. ABSOLUTELY NOT! I'm not adding my bank account to get hacked, no where did I read I need to add a bank account to get paid and that was the line in the sand. Found another option to take a 2$ fee to transfer the money to a debit card. Whatever but now ebay will have taken ~20% of the sale. So another F-U to ebay. Enter my card cause that's easy to replace if it gets hacked. And now it's telling me I have to wait another 48 hrs to get the account verified because even though I've used that card for all my ebay purchases the last 3 years I could be some criminal? I'll never sell anything on ebay again. To those that do sell periodically, your better people than me but I'll sell through market place from now on. Ebay takes too much money for way to complicated of a process and I would not care if the company collapses. Their model is antiquated and terrible for anyone that doesn't sell in volume. Sorry for the rant I just needed to vent, and best of luck to all you sellers!",

      "eBay isn’t hacking your bank account, they offer a free option to get paid, you don’t want to use that option, and chose to use the transfer to a card which costs $2, you made that decision which in turn increased the fees on your sale. There are fees that come with selling on eBay because the buyers are on eBay, you’re paying eBay to get eyes on your items for sale that you wouldn’t have otherwise. This is how it works not just on eBay but all similar selling platforms, except, I believe Facebook marketplace but can’t be sure as I haven’t used it in years. You’re getting mad over something that is not eBay’s fault. Also, yay. We want less sellers on eBay",
      "Ebay is not no, but there are alot of reports of much larger groups getting hacked that don't have bank account information and the less its stored somewhere the better I feel. So I did word that poorly and I have used other broker sights that were much clearer and simpler to use. Some things I agreed with you, it's eBay's site and like I said I don't recall reading anything about requiring a bank account. So that is likely on me I just advised I didn't see it not that it wasn't there. Downloading an app is ebay fault. Why do I have to use multiple different versions of the same thing? Very well you want less then I'll be happy to oblige.  You have one less seller.",

    "text": "my subreddits\nNewish to the hobby and just started submitting cards (sports cards) for grading. I’ve read and read reviews, opinions, and thoughts on grading, but I figured I’d ask the community. \nWith PSA being the long time go to, it’s almost offensive when you ask a hobby veteran (that has always used PSA) about another grading service. \nObviously Beckett has been around for awhile, and the excuse I’ve gotten for them not being good is their slabs are different size than PSA. What is the issue with Beckett?\nThen you got SGC, which I think their slabs look great with the black border. \nThen there is TAG. Personally, I think these look phenomenal. With TAG using Ai, which I would think creates more accuracy in the industry, why wouldn’t people support this? Is the real reason people stand by PSA, because they’ve been around the longest, and if the hobby supports someone like TAG who uses more accurate measures for grading, it would make the past 30 years of PSA graded cards essentially worthless. (Not worthless, just adding that for dramatic effect). Either way, the purpose of this is for me, and hopefully other to gain knowledge and read through peoples personal opinions and experiences. Thanks in advance and happy hunting!",
